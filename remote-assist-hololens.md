# Collaborate in mixed reality with Field Service, Remote Assist, and HoloLens

Empower field technicians to solve problems faster by pairing the Field Service business application with the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mixed reality app. With heads-up, hands-free video calling on Microsoft HoloLens, technicians using Remote Assist are able to collaborate with remote experts on a computer or a mobile device to troubleshoot issues in context. 

The field technician can view field service bookings from Remote Assist and call the recommended expert. This capability enables heads-up, hands-free calling through HoloLens in the context.

In the photograph, Skype team collaboration is displayed in the technician’s field of view on the HoloLens as the technician performs work on a piece of equipment. Either party in the video call can take advantage of holographic annotations or file sharing.

Additionally, product documentation with annotations is displayed in the technician’s field of view on the HoloLens in context of a piece of equipment.
