# Configure notifications (Screen pops) for agents

Applies to Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps version 9.1.0

[!include[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

You configure notifications (screen pops) in Unified Service Desk - Omni-channel Engagement Hub. These notifications pop up on the screen, and they contain either general information, customer-related or process-related information that the agent can act upon. Here are some examples of the information that screen pops can contain:

- Wait time

- Customer satisfaction score

- Customer/account name

- Job title

- Category

There are two types of notifications:

- Alert notifications

- Toast notification (floating notifications)
