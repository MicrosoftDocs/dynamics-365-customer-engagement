# Search for and share knowledge articles

Applies to Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps version 9.1.0

[!include[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

## Search knowledge articles

Knowledge management plays an important part in the customer service process, and access to accurate and up-to-date information can help you reduce the average handling time to provide quick and accurate answers to your customers.

Omni-channel Engagement Hub enables you to use the rich knowledge base (KB) in Dynamics 365 so that you can quickly search for relevant information while working on a case and provide accurate answers to customers without having to switch applications.

## Launch KB Search Page

You can launch KB Search in two ways:

- From the application tab menu.
- From the communication panel.

### Launch the KB Search from the application tab menu

When working on a session, you can use the **+** button on the application table panel to launch **KB Search**. You can search for a KB article using the **KB Search** tab, and then view the article and use the **Send Link** option to share the link with the customer.

1. Select the + button in the application tab panel.
2. From the menu, select **KB Search**. The KB Search opens as a new tab in the application tab panel.
3. Search for the KB articles and view.
4. Select **Send Link** to share the KB article with the customer.
