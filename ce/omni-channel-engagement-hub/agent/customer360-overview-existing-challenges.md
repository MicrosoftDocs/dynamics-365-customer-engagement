# Customer 360 - overview of the existing challenges

One of the major challenges that customers face when contacting the customer support is providing repetitive information about the issue with the support agent. Also, if the customer wants to review the status of the request raised at a later stage, the customer shares the same information with another support agent to explain the context of the engagement. To avoid this situation, the support agent must access to the customer information with details about the product/service, issue, cases history, related cases, location, and so on.

Having this information ready when customer is contacting the support agent can help reducing Hold Time that agent spends to retrieve the customer information, Average Handling Time (AHT), and increase customer satisfaction with faster resolution of the issue.

### What is Customer 360?

Customer 360 is a page where you can get the complete information about the customer when you accept an incoming request from any of the engagement channel. The default Customer 360 view provides the following cards:

-   Customer profile

-   Conversation summary

-   Issue Snapshot

-   Recent cases

-   All activities
