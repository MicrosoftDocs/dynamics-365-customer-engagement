# Apply a calendar to a resource (Project Service Automation)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Once youâ€™ve created a work hours template, you need to assign it to resources so their calendars reflect the working hours specified in the template.  
  
1.  Go to **Project Service > Resources**.  
  
2.  Select the resource you want to set the calendar for. You can select more than one resource.  
  
3.  Click **Set Calendar**.  
  
4.  Choose the work hours template you want to apply.  
  
5.  Click **Apply**.
