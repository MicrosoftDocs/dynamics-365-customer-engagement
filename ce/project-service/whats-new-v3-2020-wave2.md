# What's new or changed in Project Service Automation version 3 wave 2 2020
The topic highlights key upgrade considerations when moving to the latest release of Project Service Automation (PSA) version 3.x wave 2 2020.

## Time entry
The time entry hour edit experience has been replaced by a new Task Edit form. This adds additional capability for customization and removes a dependency on a deprecated TBX feature

### Upgrade consideration
Ensure that you validate the new edit hour experience within your test environment, any customizations you have made to the original TBX form will need to be uptaken manually into the new form based experience.
