# Time, expense, and collaboration guide (Project Service)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-psa-app-1x-2x](../includes/cc-applies-to-psa-app-1x-2x.md)]

Welcome to the [!INCLUDE[pn_project_service_auto](../includes/pn-project-service-auto.md)] app, which helps companies manage their project-based sales. 
  
 This guides you through entering your time and expenses for the projects you’re working on. Stay on top of your time and expense entry to make sure:  
  
- Your clients are billed properly  
  
- You get credit for the work you’ve done  
  
- Your managers know the status of your projects  
  
  You can also collaborate with your fellow team members by sharing documents and starting conversations through [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_groups](../includes/pn-office-365-groups.md)] associated with your projects.  
  
  You can enter time and expenses through the web app (browser-based app), or with the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] for phones and tablets app on your mobile device. When you’re ready for your next project, you can use the Project Finder Mobile app.
