# Time, Expense, and Collaboration Guide (Project Service Automation)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Welcome to the [!INCLUDE[pn_project_service_auto](../includes/pn-project-service-auto.md)] app, which helps companies manage their project-based sales. Dynamics 365 stands for customer relationship management, which your company uses to manage relationships with your clients.  
  
 This guides you through entering your time and expenses for the projects you’re working on. Stay on top of your time and expense entry to make sure:  
  
- Your clients are billed properly  
  
- You get credit for the work you’ve done  
  
- Your managers know the status of your projects  
  
  You can also collaborate with your fellow team members by sharing documents and starting conversations through [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_groups](../includes/pn-office-365-groups.md)] associated with your projects.  
  
  You can enter time and expenses through the web app (browser-based app), or with the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] for phones and tablets app on your mobile device. When you’re ready for your next project, you can use the Project Finder Mobile app.
