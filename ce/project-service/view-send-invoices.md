# View and send invoices (Project Service Automation)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

When you create a project, you set the frequency to generate invoices. You can view and review invoices before you send them to your customers.  
  
1.  Go to **Project Service > Invoices**.  
  
2.  Click the invoice you want to review.  
  
3.  Make any changes as necessary. When you’re done making changes, click **Recalculate**.  
  
4.  When you’re ready to send the invoice, click **Send to Customer**.  
  
5.  Once the customer has paid the invoice, click **Mark Invoice as Paid**.  
  
## Manually invoice a contract  
 You can manually invoice a project instead of invoicing it automatically.  
  
1.  Go to **Project Service > Projects**.  
  
2.  Click the project you want to invoice.  
  
3.  Click **Sales** and then click **Invoice**.  
  
4.  Select the parameters for the transactions you want to invoice, including cutoff date, type of item to invoice, unit, and milestone. When you’re done selecting the parameters, click **Next**.  
  
5.  Click **Finish**.
