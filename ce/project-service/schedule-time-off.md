# Schedule time off (Project Service Automation)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Schedule your vacation time or leave of absence in much the same way as you enter time for a project.  
  
 If you’re using the web app:  
  
1.  Go to **Project Service > Time Entries**. This brings up your calendar.  
  
2.  To see your calendar for the previous or next week, click **Previous** or **Next**. Click **Today** to get back to the current week.  
  
3.  To enter your time, either click **New** or double-click in the calendar under the day you want to enter time for.  
  
4.  Fill in the fields in the **Time Entry** form.  
  
5.  In **Type**, select **Vacation** or **Absence**.  
  
6.  Click **Save**.  
  
7.  Continue entering time for the week. When you’re done and everything looks correct, click **Submit**. A manager will review and approve your time off.  
  
8.  If you want to change an entry that you already submitted, select the entry in your calendar, and then click **Recall**.  
  
9. If you want to copy all the entries from a previous week to the current week, click **Copy From** and select the timesheet week you want to copy.  
  
10. If you’d rather see a list of what you’re working on, click **Grid**.
