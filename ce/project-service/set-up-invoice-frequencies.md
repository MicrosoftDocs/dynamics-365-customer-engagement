# Set up invoice frequencies (Project Service Automation)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

[!INCLUDE[pn_project_service_auto](../includes/pn-project-service-auto.md)] invoice frequencies determine how often you bill your clients, and on which day of the time period you specify. Set up an invoice frequency for each time period you plan to use for billing your clients, such as monthly, biweekly, or weekly.  
  
1.  Go to **Project Service > Invoice Frequencies**.  
  
2.  Click **New**.  
  
3.  In the **General** area, enter a name for the invoice frequency in **Name**.  
  
4.  In **Period**, select **Monthly**, **Biweekly**, or **Weekly**.  
  
5.  If you specified a period of monthly or biweekly, in **Days of run**, select **Day of period** to invoice on the specified day of the period (whether weekday or weekend), or select **Weekday of period** to invoice on the specified weekday of the period.  
  
6.  If you specified a period of monthly, in **Runs per month**, select the number of times per month you want to run the invoice.  
  
7.  In the **Invoice Frequency Details** area, change the day or weekday details as necessary to make sure the invoice runs on the correct day or weekday of the period you specified.  
  
8.  When youâ€™re done, click **Save** at the bottom right corner of the screen.
