# Use the Project Service Automation Add-in to plan your work in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_project](../includes/pn-microsoft-project.md)]

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

[!INCLUDE[pn_project_service_auto](../includes/pn-project-service-auto.md)] makes it easier for you to do your project planning including estimates. You can define the work so that costs, effort, and sales value are clear as the final proposal is submitted.  

 Now you can install the [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_dyn_365_psa_for_ms_project](../includes/pn-ms-dyn-365-psa-for-ms-project.md)] and do your planning work in the familiar environment of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_project](../includes/pn-microsoft-project.md)]. Use the robust planning and management capabilities of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_project](../includes/pn-microsoft-project.md)] and then update your project plan in Project Service Automation.
