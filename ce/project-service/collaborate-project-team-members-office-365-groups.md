2. Click the project you’re working on.  
  
3. In the bar across the top of the screen, select the down arrow next to the project name, and then click **Office 365 Groups**. This displays your project, along with items shared with your group.  
  
4. To open your team’s workspace in [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_groups](../includes/pn-office-365-groups.md)], click **Open Calendar**, **Open Conversations**, **Open Notebook**, **Open Documents**, or **Open People**.
