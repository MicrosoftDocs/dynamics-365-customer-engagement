# User guide for Project Resource Hub

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-psa-app-1x-2x](../includes/cc-applies-to-psa-app-1x-2x.md)]

- Your clients are billed properly
- You get credit for the work you’ve done

**Available anywhere, on any device**

There are two flavors of [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_project_service_auto](../includes/pn-dyn-365-project-service-auto.md)]:
