# Associate skills with resources (Project Service Automation)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

In the previous step, you already associated some skills with  a new resource. From time to time, you might need to add additional skills to a resource.  
  
1.  Go to **Project Service > Resources**.  
  
2.  Double-click the resource you want to add skills to.  
  
3.  In the **Skills** area, click **+** to add a skill.  
  
4.  In the screen that pops up, fill in the fields as needed, and then click the **Save** button at the bottom right corner of the screen.  
  
5.  Continue adding skills as necessary. When you’re done, click **Save** at the bottom right corner of the screen.
