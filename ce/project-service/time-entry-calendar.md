# Time entry calendar

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-psa-app-3.x](../includes/cc-applies-to-psa-app-3x.md)]

On the **Time Entries** page, you can view the time entries on the calendar by selecting **Show as** \> **Calendar Control**. 
 
## Updated calendar control 
In Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Project Service Automation (PSA), there is no custom calendar control to view the time entries for the week. Instead, you can view the default calendar which is built on the Unified Interface framework. You can select to view the calenday by day, week, or month. 

The calendar doesn’t support actions on individual calendar items and you can't select one or more calendar items for submission or deletion. Instead, clicking a calendar item open the **Time Entry** entity page, where you can complete the necessary actions.  

## Extensibility 
On the **Time Entries** page, in the grid, you can add additional custom fields, set up lookup fields, and create custom views. You can also set custom business logic based on values selected for or entered into custom fields.
