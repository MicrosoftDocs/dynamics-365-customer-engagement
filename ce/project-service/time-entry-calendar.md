# Time entry calendar

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-psa-app-3.x](../includes/cc-applies-to-psa-app-3x.md)]

On the **Time Entries** page, you can view the time entries on the calendar by selecting **Show as** \> **Calendar Control**.

## Updated calendar control

Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation offers a new and extensible time entry experience. This new experience replaces the Custom Calendar Control that was used in earlier versions. However, you can still view time entries through a read-only calendar control that the Unified Interface Framework provides for daily, weekly, or monthly views.

The calendar doesn't support actions on individual calendar items, and you can't select one or more calendar items for submission or deletion. Instead, select a calendar item to open the **Time Entry** entity page, where you can complete the required actions.

## Extensibility

On the **Time Entries** page that has the time entry grid, you can add custom fields, set up lookup fields, and create custom views. You can also set up custom business logic that is based on the values that are selected or entered in custom fields.
