# Approve time and expenses (Project Service Automation)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

After consultants enter their time and expenses for a project, you need to approve them so they are properly billed or costed to projects.  
  
1.  Go to **Project Service > Approvals**.  
  
2.  Click the item to approve.  
  
3.  In the **Time Entries**, **Expense Entries**, and **Absence/Vacation** tabs, review each item and make changes as necessary.  
  
4.  To approve an item, select it and click **Approve**. You can select and approve multiple items at once.  
  
5.  To reject an item, select it and click **Reject**. You can select and reject multiple items at once.  
  
6.  To view charts of time and expenses by project, click **Dashboard**.
