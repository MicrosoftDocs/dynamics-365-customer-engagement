# View resource availability (Project Service)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-psa-app-1x-2x](../includes/cc-applies-to-psa-app-1x-2x.md)]

You can check resource availability to get an overall view of how booked your resources are, or you can filter the view by skills, team, location, and other options.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[cc_feature_included_with_2016_update_1](../includes/cc-feature-included-with-2016-update-1.md)]  
> 
>  If you are using an newer version, for resource availability see, [Schedule resources for a project (Project Service Automation)](../project-service/schedule-resources-project.md).  

1. Go to **Project Service > Resource Availability**.  

    This shows a calendar view of all resources and their availability. Select a view or sort order from the top of the screen. You can also select whether to show availability for the **Day**, **Week**, or **Month**, and use the arrows to view the previous or next time period. Use the search box to find a specific resource.  

2. Click **Options** to change what displays. For example, you can show a legend that shows the color scheme for the different types of bookings, or you can choose to show only a certain type of booking (for example, hard booking or soft booking).  

3. Click **Filter** to display the **Filter** pane, which lets you filter your results by organizational unit, role, skill, or other attributes.
