# Enter expenses (Project Service Automation)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Enter your expenses at least weekly—or at the frequency requested by your managers—to ensure your clients are invoiced and you’re credited correctly.  
  
 If you’re using the web app:  
  
1. Go to **Project Service > Expenses**. This brings up your calendar.  
  
2. To see your calendar for the previous or next week, click **Previous** or **Next**. Click **Today** to get back to the current week.  
  
3. To enter an expense, either click **New** or double-click in the calendar under the day you want to enter time for.  
  
4. Fill in the fields in the **New Expense** form, and then click **Save**.  
  
5. Continue entering your expenses for the week. When you’re done and everything looks correct, click **Submit**. A manager will review and approve your expenses.  
  
6. If you want to change an entry that you already submitted, select the entry in your calendar, and then click **Recall**.  
  
7. If you’d rather see a list of what you’re working on, click **Grid**.  
  
   If you’re using the mobile app:  
  
8. From the menu, go to **Expenses**.     You can switch to **Day**, **Week**, or **Month** view, or go to the previous or next time period.  
  
9. Tap **…** and tap **New**.  
  
10. Fill in the details as necessary, and then tap **Save**.
