# Create organizational units (Project Service)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-psa-app-1x-2x](../includes/cc-applies-to-psa-app-1x-2x.md)]

Your company probably organizes its consulting business by geography, function, or other areas. You can create organizational units that reflect your consulting business. A [!INCLUDE[pn_project_service_auto](../includes/pn-project-service-auto.md)] organizational unit is a group or division in a professional services company that employs billable resources with cost rates that are distinct from other such groups or divisions in the company.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  A [!INCLUDE[pn_project_service_auto](../includes/pn-project-service-auto.md)] organizational unit is separate from a business unit in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. Business units are more of a security structure that affects levels of access to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] information, and are usually organized around company divisions, like parent company and subsidiaries or divisions. Organizational units represent how your consulting company categorizes its different businesses, whether by geographic location (like EMEA or LATAM), by function (like Product Development or IT Outsourcing), or by other parameters.  
  
1.  Go to **Project Service > Organizational Units**.  
  
2.  Click **New**.  
  
3.  In the **General** area, enter a name for the organization unit in **Name**, and fill in the other fields as necessary.  
  
4.  Click **Save** to create the record so you can continue editing it.  
  
5.  Under **Cost Price Lists**, click **+** to add a price list. You can only add price lists with the **Cost** context here.  
  
6.  In the **Name** field, click the **Search** button and select a price list you want to make available to this organizational unit. Continue adding price lists as needed.  
  
7.  When you’re done, click **Save** at the bottom right corner of the screen.
