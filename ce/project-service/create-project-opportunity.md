# Create a project opportunity (Project Service Automation)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Opportunities are warm leads from customers who are interested in contracting your services. [!INCLUDE[pn_project_service_auto](../includes/pn-project-service-auto.md)] capabilities in [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] guide you through the steps for opening an opportunity for one of your accounts, preparing a project quote, and working out a project contract with your customer. Start by adding an opportunity. You can add estimates for services and products to the opportunity, as well. When you add an opportunity, you’re in the **Qualify** phase of your project.  
  
1.  Go to **Project Service > Opportunities**.  
  
2.  Click **New**.  
  
3.  In the **Summary** area, enter your opportunity's company and other information.  
  
4.  Add any notes and activities (for example, phone calls or emails) related to this lead. To learn more about adding notes and activities, see [Keep track of notes, tasks, calls, or email with activities](../basics/work-with-activities.md).  
  
5.  To add stakeholders, in the **Stakeholders** area, click **+**.  
  
6.  To add sales team members, in the **Sales Team** area, click **+**.  
  
7.  To add competitors, in the **Competitors** area, click **+**.  
  
8.  To add a product to the opportunity, click **New** under **Product-based Lines** in the **Opportunity Lines** area. Select an item under **Product Name**, and then specify the quantity, sales price, and customer budget.  
  
9. To add a project estimate to the opportunity, click **+** under **Project-based Lines** in the **Opportunity Lines** area. Enter the name, budget amount, and project, if available. If you need to create a project with a work breakdown structure to come up with an estimate, see [Create a project](../project-service/create-project.md).  
  
10. When you’re done editing, click the **Save** button at the bottom right of the screen.
