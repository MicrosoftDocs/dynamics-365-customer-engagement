# Create product catalog items (Project Service)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-psa-app-1x-2x](../includes/cc-applies-to-psa-app-1x-2x.md)]

If you want to include products, such as software licenses, on your project quotes and estimates, you need to add each product to the product catalog.  
  
 For more information about adding products to the product catalog, see [Create a product (Sales)](../sales-enterprise/create-product-sales.md).
