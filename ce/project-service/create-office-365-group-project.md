# Create an Office 365 Group for a project (Project Service)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-psa-app-1x-2x](../includes/cc-applies-to-psa-app-1x-2x.md)]

Provide a space where team members for a project can collaborate on project documents, view the team’s calendar, and have group conversations by creating an Office 365 Group for that project.  
  
1.  Go to **Project Service > Projects**.  
  
2.  Click the project you want to work on.  
  
3.  In the bar across the top of the screen, select the down arrow next to the project name, and then click **Office 365 Groups**.  
  
4.  Click **Create Office 365 Group**. You’ll receive an email when your group is ready.
