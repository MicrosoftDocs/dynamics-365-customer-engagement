# Create a customer account (Project Service)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-psa-app-1x-2x](../includes/cc-applies-to-psa-app-1x-2x.md)]

Create an account for each client you’re working with, whether you’re quoting a project or actively working on an existing project for them.  
  
1.  Go to **Project Service > Customers**.  
  
2.  Click **New**.  
  
3.  In the **Summary** area, enter a name for your new account in **Name**, and then fill in the other fields as necessary.  
  
4.  Click **Save** to create the record so you can continue editing it.  
  
5.  In the **Project Price Lists** area, click + to add a price list. You can add more than one price list for this account.  
  
6.  When you’re done, click **Save** at the bottom right corner of the screen.
