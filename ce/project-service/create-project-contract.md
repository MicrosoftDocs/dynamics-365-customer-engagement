# Create a project contract (Project Service Automation)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Now that you’ve won the quote for your project, it’s time to create a contract with your customer and make it official. You can create one or more contracts for each quote. When you’re creating a contract, you’re in the **Contract** phase of your project.  
  
1.  In the **Project Contract** screen from the previous step, change any information as necessary in the **Summary** area.  
  
2.  To add a product to the contract, click **New** under **Product-based Lines** in the **Contract Lines** area. Select an item under **Product Name**, and then specify the quantity, sales price, and contracted amount.  
  
3.  To add a project-based line to the contract, click **+** under **Project-based Lines** in the **Contract Lines** area. Enter the name, budget amount, and project, if available. If you need to create a project with a work breakdown structure to come up with an estimate, see [Create a project](../project-service/create-project.md).  
  
4.  When you’re done editing, click the **Save** button at the bottom right of the screen.  
  
5.  When you’re ready to send the quote to your customer, click **More** (…), click **Run Report**, and then click **Order**. Save the report as a [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Word_short](../includes/pn-ms-word-short.md)] document, edit as necessary, and then send the contract to your customer.  
  
6.  If your customer confirms your contract, click **Confirm** at the top of the **Project Contract** screen. If your customer wants you to change some items, create a new contract. If your customer decides not to use your services at this time, click **Close as Lost** at the top of the **Project Contract** screen.
