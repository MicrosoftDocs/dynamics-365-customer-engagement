# Sign in (Project Service Automation)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

When you sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] Customer Engagement apps, you need to have the following information from your Dynamics 365 administrator:  
  
-   URL for your organization’s [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] system  
  
-   Your user name  
  
-   Your password  
  
 You probably received this information in an email from your admin. If you don’t have all this info, or if you have issues signing in, [Find your Dynamics 365 administrator or support person](../basics/find-administrator-support.md).  
  
## Set your personal options to allow email  
 You need to configure your email settings to allow others to send email on your behalf, so [!INCLUDE[pn_project_service_auto](../includes/pn-project-service-auto.md)] can send email notifications for you when you have time and expenses to approve or sign up for projects.  
  
1.  Click the gear button in the top right corner of the screen.  
  
2.  Click the **Options**.  
  
3.  Click the **Email** tab.  
  
4.  Select **Allow other Microsoft Dynamics 365 users to send email on your behalf**.  
  
5.  Click **OK**.
