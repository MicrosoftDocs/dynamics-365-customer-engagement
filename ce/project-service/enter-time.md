# Enter time (Project Service)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-psa-app-1x-2x](../includes/cc-applies-to-psa-app-1x-2x.md)]

Enter your hours at least weekly—or at the frequency requested by your managers—to ensure your clients are invoiced and you’re credited correctly.  
  
 If you’re using the web app:  
  
1. Go to **Project Service > Time Entries**. This brings up your calendar.  
  
2. To see your calendar for the previous or next week, click **Previous** or **Next**. Click **Today** to get back to the current week.  
  
3. To enter your time, either click **New** or double-click in the calendar under the day you want to enter time for.  
  
4. Fill in the fields in the **Time Entry** form and click **Save**.  
  
5. Continue entering time for the week. When you’re done and everything looks correct, click **Submit**. A manager will review and approve your time entries.  
  
6. If you want to change an entry that you already submitted, select the entry in your calendar and then click **Recall**.  
  
7. If you want to copy all the entries from a previous week to the current week, click **Copy From** and select the timesheet week you want to copy.  
  
8. If you’d rather see a list of what you’re working on, click **Grid**.  
  
   If you’re using the mobile app:  
  
9. From the menu, go to **Time Entries**.     You can switch to **Day**, **Week**, or **Month** view, or navigate to the previous or next time period.  
  
10. Tap **…** and tap **New**.  
  
11. Fill in the details as necessary and tap **Save**.
