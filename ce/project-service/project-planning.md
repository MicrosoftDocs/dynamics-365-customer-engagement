Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation offers end-to-end support for service organizations by providing tools for managing the sales and delivery process. It helps these organizations identify opportunities, submit bids, reach contractual agreements, manage resources, deliver projects on time and within budget, record time and expenses, and invoice the customer. Team members can collaborate on projects, and they can maintain current, accurate project status information so that project managers can identify and manage project risks. These advanced tasks are typically performed in larger organizations that have separate divisions that work together.

## Project management tools

The project management tools in PSA help you easily run projects. Built-in templates and scheduling tools help project managers and teams stay productive. Here are some of the tasks that the tools help with:

- Plan projects by using a work schedule and estimates.
- Estimate and track project costs and revenue.
- Use project estimates during the sales process.
- Forecast resource requirements for projects that are in the pipeline.
- Successfully deliver projects by tracking progress and cost consumption.

The following topics provide information that will help project managers estimate work, estimate project costs, and forecast resource requirements by using the tools that are supported in PSA:

- [Creating a schedule](project-creating.md)
- [Estimating project cost and revenue](project-estimating.md)
- [Leveraging the schedule and estimates](project-leveraging.md)
- [Tracking project progress and cost consumption](project-tracking.md)
- [Project templates](project-templates.md)
- [Project stages](project-stages.md)
- [Project settings](project-settings.md)
