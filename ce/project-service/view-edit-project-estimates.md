# View and edit project estimates (Project Service)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-psa-app-1x-2x](../includes/cc-applies-to-psa-app-1x-2x.md)]

With the [!INCLUDE[pn_project_service_auto](../includes/pn-project-service-auto.md)] capabilities in [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)], you can view estimates for a project, including estimates by cost, sales, or effort.  
  
1.  Go to **Project Service > Projects**.  
  
2.  Click the project you want to work on.  
  
3.  In the bar across the top of the screen, select the down arrow next to the project name, and then click **Project Estimates**.  
  
4.  In **Time-phase By**, select **Effort**, **Cost**, or **Sales** to change which project estimates to display.  
  
5.  To add or delete expenses, click **Show Grid View**. To create a new expense, click **New Expense**. To delete an expense, select it from the list, and then click **Delete Expense**. When you’re done adding or deleting expenses, click **Save**.
