# Get feedback by using Voice of the Customer surveys

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Voice of the Customer (VoC) is being deprecated and replaced with Microsoft Forms Pro. [Learn more](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2097704)

You can create and send surveys to your customers to receive their valuable feedback about your products or services. The customers can take your surveys on a phone, tablet, or computer. With Voice of the Customer for Dynamics 365, you create and distribute surveys and store survey responses in Dynamics 365 along with other Dynamics 365 data. You can see your customer's feedback history as you work on a sales prospect (lead) or resolve a service case. When a customer completes a survey, leads can be created automatically based on the feedback.

> [!NOTE]
> Voice of the Customer for Dynamics 365 is available with [!INCLUDE[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-online-2016-update](../includes/pn-crm-online-2016-update.md)] and later.
