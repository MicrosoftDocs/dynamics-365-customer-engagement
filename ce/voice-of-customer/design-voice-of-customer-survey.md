# Design your Voice of the Customer survey 
Once you’ve uploaded your images to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], designed at least one theme, and made any planning decisions, it’s time to design your [!INCLUDE[pn-voice-of-the-customer-full](../includes/pn-voice-of-the-customer-full.md)] survey.  
  
1.  From the menu, go to **[!INCLUDE[pn-voice-of-the-customer-full](../includes/pn-voice-of-the-customer-full.md)] > Surveys**.  
  
2.  Click **New**.  
  
3.  Enter information in the **Summary** area, and then click **Save** to create the survey record so you can continue designing your survey.  
  
4.  In the **Survey Runtime** area, specify the theme and logo image you want to use. Also set the values for header and footer text, navigation, and other options. If you need extra help, hover over any field to read the tooltips.  
  
5.  In the **Invitations and Actions** area, specify values for each field. If you need extra help, hover over any field to read the tooltips.  
  
6.  Edit the items in the **Advanced** and **Feedback** areas as necessary.  
  
7.  When you’re done editing information about the survey, click **Save**.  
  
8.  In the **Survey** box, click **Designer**.  
  
9. Edit each page of your survey. These are some of the actions you can take:  
  
    -   To change pages, click a page on the left side of the survey designer.  
  
    -   To edit an item on a page, hover over the item and click one of the editing buttons that appear to the right of the item. If you need extra help, hover over an editing button to read the tooltips.  
  
    -   To add a page, click the page button at the bottom of the left side of the survey designer.  
  
    -   To add a question, drag and drop the type of question you want from the **Survey parts** pane to the location you want on the survey page. If you need extra help, hover over a survey part to read the tooltips.  
  
        > [!NOTE]
        >  Drag and drop only works with a mouse or other pointing device. It’s not supported through touch on devices with touch screens, like tablets.  
  
    -   Personalize your survey with fields like the customer's name or service case number by using piped data. For more information, see [Add piped data to a survey](personalize-voice-of-customer-surveys-piped-data.md).  
  
    -   Take different actions in the survey, like showing additional questions or sending a request for contact to a user within your organization, based on a customer's response. For more information, see [Create a response routing rule in a survey](create-response-routing-rule-voice-of-customer-survey.md).  
  
10. To save your work, click the **Save** button in the bottom right corner of the screen.  
  
11. When you’re done editing your survey, click **Publish**. After it’s published, you can do the following:  
  
    -   To step through your survey, click **Test**.  
  
    -   To preview your survey, click **Preview**.  
  
    -   To create a copy of your survey, click **Clone**.  
  
    -   To export translations, click **Export translations**. You can then access the resulting Translations.xml file from the **Summary** area of your survey.  
  
    -   To copy snippets to use elsewhere in this survey or others, select the snippet (survey part or text) you want to copy, and then click **Copy snippet**. If you want to copy a face, rating, or NPS snippet, click … and then click the action you want to do.  
  
    -   To stop this survey from running, click **Stop**.
