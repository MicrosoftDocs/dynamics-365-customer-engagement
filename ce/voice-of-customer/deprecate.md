# Voice of the Customer is deprecated

As mentioned in the [deprecation announcement](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/bdm/2019/07/01/voice-of-the-customer-deprecation/) on July 01, 2019, Voice of the Customer is deprecated as of July 01, 2020. This impacts only customers who are using the Voice of the Customer solution for Dynamics 365 apps. Moving forward, [Microsoft Forms Pro](https://formspro.microsoft.com/) will provide seamless integration for surveys within Microsoft Business Applications, including Dynamics 365 and Microsoft 365.

## What does deprecation mean?

Access to Voice of the Customer – including the ability to create new surveys and collect responses from live surveys – will be unavailable after July 1, 2020. However, existing survey data will continue to remain stored and available in Dynamics 365.

## What should you do?

We encourage all customers to use Forms Pro for new surveys implementation. Forms Pro is available as an entitlement with the following Dynamics 365 Enterprise apps: Sales, Customer Service, Field Service, Marketing, Talent, and Project Service Automation.

For questions about Voice of the Customer and guidance on how to move to Forms Pro, please contact [vocsupport@microsoft.com](mailto:vocsupport@microsoft.com).
