# Customize HTML or XML for particular elements in Voice of the Customer surveys 
You can start using [!INCLUDE[pn-voice-of-the-customer-full](../includes/pn-voice-of-the-customer-full.md)] surveys right away, without any extra configuration. If you have specific customizations you would like to make, however, you can customize the HTML or XML for these elements:  
  
-   Email Face Template  
  
-   Email NPS Template  
  
-   Email Rating Template  
  
-   Feedback Charts  
  
-   Feedback Dashboards  
  
-   Feedback Form - Actions Tab  
  
-   Feedback Form - Empty Response Section  
  
-   Feedback Form - Feedback Tab  
  
-   Feedback Form - General Tab  
  
-   Feedback Form - Score Tab  
  
 You can also import XML from an existing survey.  
  
#### Change survey configurations  
  
1.  Go to **Settings > VoC Configurations**.  
  
2.  Choose a configuration to edit from the **Active Configurations** list or click **New** to create one.  
  
3.  Change the values in the **General Settings** area as needed.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you're using a version of [!INCLUDE[pn-voice-of-the-customer](../includes/pn-voice-of-the-customer.md)] earlier than 9.0.781.3, you can also change the values in the **Response Fetching** areas. If you're not sure what version you're using, ask your administrator. If you're an administrator, go to **Settings > Solutions** to determine the version.   
  
4.  Scroll to the template you want to change and edit the HTML or XML to achieve the look you want.  
  
#### Import survey XML  
  
1.  Go to **Settings > VoC Imports**.  
  
2.  Click **New**.  
  
3.  Enter a name for the import, adjust the settings as necessary, and add the survey XML you want to import.  
  
4.  Click **Save**.  
  
5.  Click **Activate** to activate the import.
