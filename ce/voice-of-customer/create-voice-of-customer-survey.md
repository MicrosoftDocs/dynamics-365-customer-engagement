# Create a Voice of the Customer survey to get customer feedback 
Create and send out [!INCLUDE[pn-voice-of-the-customer-full](../includes/pn-voice-of-the-customer-full.md)] surveys to gain valuable feedback from your customers about your products or services. Respondents can take your surveys on a phone, tablet, or computer. You can see your customer's feedback history as you work a sale or resolve a service case.  
  
 When a customer completes a survey, you can use rules to trigger follow-up actions that occur immediately. For example, if a customer answers a survey question that indicates an interest in one of your products, the system can generate a quote request and assign it to a salesperson. Or, if a customer replies with a complaint, the system can create a new service case and route it to the right queue for prompt handling. You can also send a survey automatically when a service case closes, to track how satisfied your customer is with the service they received.  
  
 The survey analytics included with the [!INCLUDE[pn-voice-of-the-customer-full](../includes/pn-voice-of-the-customer-full.md)] solution help you use customer feedback to identify gaps in service, run targeted marketing campaigns, or send offers to increase sales.
