# Design a basic survey

After deciding the types of questions you want to include in your survey, you must now create the survey. This article provides information about the basics of designing a survey, creating a survey theme, and adding questions to the survey. More information about advanced survey design: [Design an advanced survey](design-advanced-survey.md)  

> [!NOTE]
> You must be a survey administrator or survey designer to perform the actions described in this chapter. A survey administrator has access at the organization level, whereas the survey designer has access at the business-unit level.

## Create a survey theme

You can create a theme for your survey to match your company's style. Themes define the color scheme for your surveys. You can design multiple themes and use them in different surveys.

    ![Select element color in a theme](media/element-color-theme.png "Select element color in a theme")  

7.  Select **Save**.

**Voice of the Customer app**

Voice of the Customer app provides a WYSIWYG theme designer. This allows you to see how a survey will look when the theme is applied to it. In addition to modifying theme colors, you can also modify the font type, font size, and font color of the elements in the survey.

    ![Select element color in a theme](media/survey-theme-color.png "Select element color in a theme")

    ![Select element font properties](media/survey-theme-font-prop.png "Select element font properties") 

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you upgrade Voice of the Customer to version 9.0.1162 and higher, there might be changes to the survey theme during the upgrade. You must preview a survey before publishing it.

7. Select **Save**.

## Upload image

You can upload images to [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-2016-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)] and add them to your surveys later. After an image is uploaded, you can reuse it in multiple surveys.

## Create and add survey questions

After your survey is created, you can start adding questions to it by using the survey designer. By default, following pages are available in the survey designer:

- **Welcome page**: Displays a welcome message to the respondent.

    ![Imported section in a survey](media/imported-section.png "Imported section in a survey")


### Share questions between surveys by using linked questions

You can easily share questions between surveys for reporting purposes by using linked questions. For example, you might have a common question about customer satisfaction that you ask all respondents at the end of each survey and you want to report on that question from all surveys. Another example where linking questions is recommended is for multilingual surveys; you might have cloned the survey for five different languages but want to report on the results across all languages. Linked questions are also used by response routing rules to create actions from a survey response.

To create a linked question:

**Web client**

## Personalize a survey

Use placeholders to automatically insert [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-2016-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)] information into your survey. Piped data is used as placeholders to include personalized [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-2016-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)] data in your survey. For example, you can use piped data to automatically insert a customer's first name into the text on your survey's Welcome screen.

You can add the following data as placeholders:

-   User data (for example, a customer service representative's name)

-   Customer name

-   Service name

-   Product name

-   Date and time

-   Location

> [!NOTE]
> - Piped data can be used in personalizing survey invitations. [!INCLUDE[proc-more-information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Personalize survey invitations](distribute-survey.md#personalize-survey-invitations)  
> - Don't use piped data if you plan to distribute a survey anonymously. Piped data will not be replaced with actual [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-2016-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)] data in an anonymous survey.
> - Piped data placeholders are replaced with the values specified in appropriate fields in a survey activity or invitation, or survey email.

### Insert personalized data in a survey

**Web client**

    *Thank you, Marie! Your feedback will help us improve the service we deliver to you.*

8.  Select **Save** in the lower-right corner of the screen.


## Preview, publish, and test the survey

After you have created and edited a survey, you can preview, publish, and test the survey before distributing it to the respondents.

The **Preview**, **Publish**, and **Test** commands are available on the toolbar at the top of the screen.

![Preview, publish, and test a survey](media/preview-survey.png "Preview, publish, and test a survey")  

-   To preview a survey, select **Preview**. We recommend that you preview the survey before publishing it to catch and rectify any missing information.

-   To publish a survey to the cloud, select **Publish**. After publishing a survey, you can distribute it to respondents.

-   To step through your survey as it will look to respondents, select **Test**. You can't test a survey until after you publish it.

For example, if you add two questions to a published survey, preview it first to see if the survey is working. After previewing the survey, you publish it to the cloud and then you can test the survey to see how it will look to respondents. If you test the survey before you publish it, you will not see your recent changes.

> [!NOTE]
> Survey responses are not stored in [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-2016-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)] when you preview or test a survey.

## Clone or import an existing survey

You can reuse existing questions and sections to avoid creating the same questions multiple times for different surveys.

-   If you want to reuse only a section from another survey in your survey, you can [import the section](#import-a-section-into-a-page).  

-   If you want to create a survey exactly like another survey with some minor changes, you can clone a survey.

-   If you want to move a survey from one environment to another, you can import the survey.

> [!NOTE]
> Importing or cloning a survey more than 1 MB is not supported.

### Clone a survey

Cloning a survey means creating an exact duplicate survey where only the name is different. The new survey is created with an integer appended to the survey name. The cloned survey will be in Draft status. The questions are separate from the first survey, and any changes to one survey are not reflected in the other survey.

> [!NOTE]
> To clone a survey, it must be in Published status. You cannot clone a survey that is in Draft status.

1.  Sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-2016-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)] or [open Voice of the Customer app](install-solution.md#open-voice-of-the-customer-app).

## Translate a survey

After creating a survey, you can translate it into other languages as required by your respondents.

1.  Sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-2016-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)] or [open Voice of the Customer app](install-solution.md#open-voice-of-the-customer-app).

2.  Go to **Voice of the Customer** &gt; **Surveys**.

3.  Select the name of the survey you want to translate.

4.  Select the Translations.xml file in the **Notes** section, and then save it to the location you want.

    **Web client**

    ![Translation file of a survey](media/translate-survey.png "Translation file of a survey")

    **Voice of the Customer app**

    ![Translation file of a survey](media/translate-survey-uci.png "Translation file of a survey")

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the Translations.xml file is not available, select **Export translations** on the toolbar at the top of the screen to generate the file.

5.  Open the file in [!INCLUDE[pn-excel-short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)], and then go to the **Translations** tab.

6.  Add a column to the right of the base language (for example, **en** for English), and specify the locale for the language in the column heading (for example, **es** for Spanish). You can also specify a locale in the heading (for example, **en-uk** for English in the United Kingdom). Add columns for each language or locale you need.

    > [!NOTE]
    > - You must only use the language codes supported by [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-2016-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)] for the system-provided strings to be translated into, otherwise they will be displayed in the base language.
    > - You must be sure to mention specific locales where multiple dialects are supported.

7.  Add translations to each language or locale column. You can retrieve translations from [[!INCLUDE[pn-bing](../includes/pn-bing.md)] translations](https://www.bing.com/translator/). If your text strings have HTML in them, you'll need to encode them. For example, you need to encode:  

    &lt;b&gt;Hello!&lt;/b&gt;

    as:

    &lt;b&gt;Hello!&lt;/b&gt;

    You can use any HTML encoder.

8.  After completing your translations, save the file, go back to [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-2016-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)], and then delete the Translations.xml file by selecting the delete icon next to the file.

    > [!NOTE]
    > -   In web client, point to the file name, and then select **Delete**.
    > -   In Voice of the Customer app, select **Delete**.
    > -   If you accidentally delete the Translations.xml file, select **Export translations** on the survey page to generate the file.
    > -   For every language added in the Translations.xml file, remember to provide a translation for each string in that language while editing it in [!INCLUDE[pn-excel-short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)].

9.  Select **Attach**, browse to your new Translations.xml file, and then select **Done**.

> [!NOTE]
> -   A survey can be translated into multiple languages if the translations file consists of the translations with the correct country codes in each column.
> -   If you add or change a question after adding your edited translations file, you need to add the translation for that question. To get an updated version of the translation file, select **Export translations** on the survey page and repeat the steps to add your new translations.
> -   We recommend that you preview the survey with the latest translation file to detect any translation errors.
> -   [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-2016-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)] automatically detects the language at runtime based on the respondent's browser preferences. If no translation exists for that language, the survey will use the base language strings instead. Users can change the language of the survey by selecting the language they want from the drop-down list.
> - When you preview or publish a survey, the translation file is validated for missing string translations and incorrect HTML format. The appropriate error message is displayed with a link to download the log file to view details.

## Close or stop a survey

You can close a survey on a designated date by specifying the **Close Date** while creating or editing the survey.

If you want to stop the survey immediately, select **Stop** on the toolbar.

We recommend that when you create a survey you specify a redirect URL to display to users when the survey is closed, stopped, or an error has occurred.

## Delete a survey

You can delete a survey if it is not required anymore. When a survey is deleted, all its dependent entities are also deleted.

To delete a survey:
1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-2016-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)] or [open Voice of the Customer app](install-solution.md#open-voice-of-the-customer-app).
