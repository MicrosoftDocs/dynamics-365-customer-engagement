# Plan a survey

It's important to have a plan for configuring your Voice of the Customer surveys. Here are a few things to think about to help you design the right questions for your survey:

-   What's the purpose of your survey? For example, you might want to interact with your customers, promote new products or services, or measure customer satisfaction. If your goal is to measure something, what and how do you want to measure it?

-   How long do you want the survey to be? Keep in mind that longer surveys tend to have higher abandon rates. A good rule of thumb is to keep surveys shorter than five minutes, or no longer than 10 questions (depending on the type of question you ask).

-   How many mandatory questions are to be included in the survey? We recommend that you ask as few mandatory questions as possible.

-   Can you reuse all or part of an existing survey?

-   Do you want to analyze results from multiple surveys at once? You can do this by linking questions across surveys.

-   How do you want to distribute your survey? For example, you can create an anonymous link for a lead creation survey and broadcast it, or you can send personalized links for case closure surveys to your customers.

-   How do you want to send invitations to your survey? For example, you might want to email them or post an invitation on your website.

-   In addition, consider these recommendations to help you improve survey response rates:

    -   Send the survey with a named contact from your organization, preferably one who your respondents know.

    -   Add an image of this contact to the survey.

## Best practices to create a survey

A few best practices will enable you to create a meaningful survey and gather good responses from your customers. You can then analyze those responses and act on them as best suits your organization. A few of the best practices for designing a survey are:

- **Define an objective**: Having an objective allows you to properly plan for your survey. This also allows you to identify what results you expect from your customers. You must know how you will use the responses to help you pick the right questions for your survey.

- **Keep the survey short**: If you create a survey that takes a long time to complete, you might reduce your response rate.
- **Create a logical flow of questions**: Ensure that your survey has a logical flow of questions to keep the respondents interested in the survey.

- **Organize the survey**: Group the related questions in a section and place the related sections on a single page.

- **Ask one question at a time**: Ensure that you ask only one question at a time to keep your audience focused. Avoid asking questions that are vague or don't communicate your intent. Keep the objective of your questions clear to your respondents. Avoid asking questions that are too narrow, such as "Do you like chocolate and ice cream?"

- **Preview and test the survey**: After creating your survey, always preview it to check the overall flow of the survey and to catch any mistakes. After publishing the survey, test it to ensure that respondents can find and open it easily.

- **Mention expectations in the survey invitation**: In the survey invitation, ensure that you mention the estimated time to complete it and give a brief overview. This will help respondents submit their input within the expected timeframe.

## Decide the question type

Deciding the question types while planning a survey helps you to create an organized survey and maintain a flow between the questions. The following table describes the Voice of the Customer for [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-2016-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)] question types.
