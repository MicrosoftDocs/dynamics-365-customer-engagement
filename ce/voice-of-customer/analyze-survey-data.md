# Analyze survey data

Voice of the Customer stores all survey responses in [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-2016-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)], and you can analyze them by using features such as:

- Survey response entity

- Advance find queries

- [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-2016-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)] reports

- Feedback entity

- Survey dashboard

You can also generate custom reports based on the responses to meet your requirements. More information about creating reports: [Create or edit a report using the Report Wizard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/basics/create-edit-copy-report-wizard)  

## Survey responses

A survey response record is created after a respondent submits a survey. Based on the response received, out-of-the-box workflows are triggered, and the corresponding fields are populated in the survey response. If you have mapped the question responses to additional fields, the mapped field is populated with the survey response.

To view all survey responses:

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-2016-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)] or [open Voice of the Customer app](install-solution.md#open-voice-of-the-customer-app).

2. Go to **Voice of the Customer** &gt; **Survey Responses**.

3. Select the survey response you want to view.

To view survey response for a survey:

**Web client**

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-2016-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)].

2. Go to **Voice of the Customer** &gt; **Surveys**.

3. Select the name of the survey for which you want to view survey responses.

4. Select the down arrow next to your survey name at the top of the screen, and then select **Survey Responses**.

5. Select the survey response you want to view.

**Voice of the Customer app**

1.  [Open Voice of the Customer app](install-solution.md#open-voice-of-the-customer-app).

2.  Go to **Voice of the Customer** &gt; **Surveys**.

3.  Select the name of the survey for which you want to view survey responses.

4.  Under **Related**, select **Survey Responses**.

5.  Select the survey response you want to view.

Additionally, you can export survey responses to [!INCLUDE[pn-excel-short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)] and perform further analysis by using [!INCLUDE[pn-excel-short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)] features. [!INCLUDE[proc-more-information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Export data to [!INCLUDE[pn-excel-short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/basics/export-data-excel)  

You can also use Advanced Find to create customized queries. For example, you can create a query to fetch all the survey responses where the Net Promoter Score is equal to Detractor. [!INCLUDE[proc-more-information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Advanced Find search](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/basics/save-advanced-find-search)  

![Create custom query by using Advanced find](media/advanced-find.png "Create a custom query by using Advanced Find")  

## Store responses in a custom field by using response mapping

Voice of the Customer provides some additional fields in the Survey Response entity on the **Measures** tab in the Survey Response form. You can map and store the response to a question in these fields. To map the response to a question to a field, you must select the field from the **Response Mapping** list in the question form (in web client) or **Map response to** list in the **Properties** pane (in Voice of the Customer app) when you create the question.

**Web client**

**Voice of the Customer app**

![Response mapping to a custom field](media/custom-field-response-mapping-uci.png "Response mapping to a custom field")

Response mapping makes the question responses directly available as part of the Survey Response entity and, therefore, readily available to reports and workflows. The mapping fields available on the survey response are listed in the following table.
