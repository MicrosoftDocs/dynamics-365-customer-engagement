# Troubleshoot Voice of the Customer solution

This chapter provides information for troubleshooting the Voice of the Customer solution in case any issue occurs.

## Reconfigure Voice of the Customer

If the Voice of the Customer solution is accidentally deleted or misconfigured, it may not be able to receive survey responses. To remediate this, you can now repair or restore the Voice of the Customer configuration from the **Voice of the Customer Configurations** page.

> [!Note]
> You must be a survey administrator to reconfigure Voice of the Customer solution.

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-2016-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)].
2. Go to **Settings** > **Voice of the Customer Configurations**.
3. Select **Configure** from the toolbar at the top of the screen.
