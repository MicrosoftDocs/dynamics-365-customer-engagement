- **Voice of the Customer app**: The Voice of the Customer app provides a new experience in survey designing as well as theme designing. The new survey designer provides a simple and intuitive experience for survey designers to add, remove, and modify survey pages, sections, questions, and answers. When you install Voice of the Customer version 9.0.1162 and higher, the Voice of the Customer app, built on the Unified Interface framework, is created out-of-the-box.

## Voice of the Customer version 9.0.1113.10

  - Voice of the Customer configuration and provisioning is in proper state.
  - Survey lifecycle is working fine for the organization.

You must take appropriate actions based on the customer's request. More information: [Implement GDPR in Voice of the Customer](implement-gdpr.md)
