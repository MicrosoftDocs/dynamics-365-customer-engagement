# Install the Voice of the Customer solution

This section provides you the steps to install the Voice of the Customer for [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-2016-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)] solutions. If you're an administrator, you can find the version by going to **Settings** &gt; **Solutions**.

> [!NOTE] 
> Surveys aren't supported on legacy forms.

## Install the Voice of the Customer solution, version 9.0 and later

 The Voice of the Customer for [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-2016-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)] solution can be installed from [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-online-admin-center](../includes/pn-crm-online-admin-center.md)]. It is compatible with [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-2016-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)] version 8.2 and later.

> [!NOTE]
> You must be a tenant administrator to install the solution.

1.  Sign in to your [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-2016-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)] solution as administrator.

2.  Go to the [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-online-admin-center](../includes/pn-crm-online-admin-center.md)], and then select the **Applications** tab.

3.  Select the application row titled **Voice Of The Customer**, and then select **Manage**.

4.  From the **[!INCLUDE[pn-crm-2016-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)] Instance** drop-down list, select the instance where you want to install the solution.

	> [!NOTE]
	> The list of instances only displays the organizations with [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-2016-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)] version 8.2.

5.  Accept the license terms.

6.  Select **Install**.

When you install Voice of the Customer, a VOC Push Service user is created automatically. This user is created to allow Voice of the Customer Azure service to authenticate with Dynamics 365 using Server-to-Server (S2S) authentication, and is primarily used for pushing survey responses. The VOC Push Service user is an application user and does not consume any license. The user is assigned Survey Administrator role. More information on S2S authentication: [Server-to-Server (S2S) authentication](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt790168.aspx).

> [!NOTE]
> The VOC Push Service user runs only with minimum required privileges to communicate to Voice of the Customer Azure service, and if your organization deploys a custom plugin that runs on the Survey Response entity, you are advised to do either of following:
> - Run the Custom Plugin in System User Context.
> - Create a custom role with privileges required by custom plugin operations and assign the security role to Voice of the Customer application user.


### Track the installation status 

1.  Go to the [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-online-admin-center](../includes/pn-crm-online-admin-center.md)], and then select the **Instances** tab.
2.  Select the instance name, and then select **Solutions**.
    The status is displayed in the **Status** column.

## Voice of the Customer app

The Voice of the Customer app provides a new experience in survey designing as well as theme designing. The new survey designer provides a simple and intuitive experience for survey designers to add, remove, and modify survey pages, sections, questions, and answers.

When you install Voice of the Customer version 9.0.1162 and higher, the Voice of the Customer app, built on the Unified Interface framework, is created out-of-the-box.

### Open Voice of the Customer app

1. Sign in to Dynamics 365.

2. Open the URL `<organization URL>/apps`.

3. Select the Voice of the Customer app.

> [!NOTE]
> - To use the Voice of the Customer app, a user must be assigned the **Voice of the Customer app access role** security role. If this role is not assigned, users will see the web client behavior in Voice of the Customer app. More information on how to assign a security role to a user: [Assign a security role to a user](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles#assign-a-security-role-to-a-user)
> - When you assign the **Voice of the Customer app access role** security role to a user, the user will see duplicate forms for a few entities (survey, theme, and image) in web client. These forms are built for the Unified Client interface and must be used from the Voice of the Customer app only.
