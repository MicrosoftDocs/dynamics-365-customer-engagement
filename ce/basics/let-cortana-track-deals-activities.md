# Preview feature: Let Cortana help you track your Dynamics 365 deals and activities 

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We are working to deliver a robust and scalable digital assistant experience across all of our Dynamics 365 offerings. This includes natural language integration for customers and partners across multiple channels including [!INCLUDE[pn_cortana](../includes/pn-cortana.md)]. To that end, we are discontinuing the current [!INCLUDE[pn_cortana](../includes/pn-cortana.md)] integration preview feature that was made available for Dynamics 365 and we are focusing on building a new long term intelligent solution experience, which will include [!INCLUDE[pn_cortana](../includes/pn-cortana.md)] digital assistant integration.

We’re introducing [!INCLUDE[pn_cortana](../includes/pn-cortana.md)] integration to help you keep track of important [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] activities. [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_2016_update_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-2016-update-shortest.md)] embeds sales activities, accounts, and opportunities into [!INCLUDE[pn_cortana](../includes/pn-cortana.md)] to surface what’s most relevant to salespeople at any time.  
  
 Cortana integration is available as a preview feature to organizations that use [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_2016_update_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-2016-update-shortest.md)]. [!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_expect_changes](../includes/cc-preview-features-expect-changes.md)]  
  
[!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_definition](../includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)]

> [!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_no_MS_support](../includes/cc-preview-features-no-ms-support.md)]  
  
 <!-- Eventually, Cortana integration will be fully included in the product. --> 
  
## Enable Cortana integration with Dynamics 365 on your device  
 If your admin has enabled [!INCLUDE[pn_cortana](../includes/pn-cortana.md)] integration with your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] system, [!INCLUDE[pn_cortana](../includes/pn-cortana.md)] will prompt you to connect with [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. Just follow the prompts to connect.  
  
 **Dynamics 365** now appears in Cortana’s notebook, and [!INCLUDE[pn_cortana](../includes/pn-cortana.md)] will prompt you with relevant information about your sales activities, accounts, opportunities, and meetings.
