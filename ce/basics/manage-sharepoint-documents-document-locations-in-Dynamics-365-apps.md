# Manage your SharePoint documents and document locations from Dynamics 365

[//]: # (Editor's note, just in case my deleting the comma below seems arbitrary: The comma in the Description metadata field above separates two complete sentences, so it's a perfect place for the comma. In the sentence below, the introductory clause "With Dynamics 365" turns the rest of the sentence into a clause itself, so no comma is needed to divide the two ideas.)
With [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], you can store your documents on [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] and manage them from within your app.

The documents that you create in [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] are stored on [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)], and are automatically synced to your desktop and mobile devices.

> [!Note]
> Before you can use [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] to store the documents, it must be enabled by your system administrator.
> 
> [!Important]
> This feature requires that you have an [!INCLUDE[pn-office-365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] subscription or a subscription to an online service such as [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)].

The name of the document location is in the following format: &lt;record\_name&gt;\_&lt;record\_id&gt;.

By default, the location is set to Documents on Default Site 1.
