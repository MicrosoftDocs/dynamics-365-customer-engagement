# Collaborate with your team

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

[!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] offers a number of tools for collaboration. Through integration with other Microsoft collaboration tools, users of Dynamics 365 can work closely with team members, even if they are not also users of the Dynamics 365 business applications.

- **[!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_groups](../includes/pn-office-365-groups.md)]** - Out-of-the-box integration with [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_groups](../includes/pn-office-365-groups.md)] for agenda, conversation, OneNote, documents, and member management. See [Collaborate with your colleagues using Office 365 Groups](../basics/collaborate-with-colleagues-using-office-365-groups.md).

- **[!INCLUDE[pn_onedrive_for_business](../includes/pn-onedrive-for-business.md)]** - Store documents in your [!INCLUDE[pn_onedrive_for_business](../includes/pn-onedrive-for-business.md)] workspace. See [Use OneDrive for Business to manage your private documents](../basics/use-onedrive-business-manage-private-documents.md).

- **[!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)]** - Access notes stored in [!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)]. See [Use OneNote in Dynamics 365 (online)](../basics/use-onenote.md).

- **[!INCLUDE[pn_yammer](../includes/pn-yammer.md)]** - Use one place to have conversations, create and edit documents, and share information with your colleagues without sending a single email or attending any meetings. See [Collaborate and communicate with Yammer](../basics/collaborate-communicate-with-yammer.md).
