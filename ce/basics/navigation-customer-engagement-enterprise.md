<!--, Operations, or Financials.  AMYLA: Removed these because it is not exactly the right list anymore with their name changes-->
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If you need to setup the product catalog or other management task, or if you’re an administrator, open [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] – Custom to access functions in the Settings area.

1.  Sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)], click the [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] app launcher, and then click the **[!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]** icon.

## Find your way around the app menus
 When you open an app, you’ll see tiles and icons (called a *sitemap*) for that app. Use the icons to access different types of information relevant to that role.  
  
 The following illustrations describe the sitemaps for the  Sales, Customer Service, and [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] – Custom apps.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Your Sales or Customer Service app sitemap may be different if your app has been customized.

 **6**. See **Sync Errors** associated with mobile offline.  
  
 **7**. Use **Customizations** to make Dynamics 365 work the way your business does: add or remove fields, create or customize forms, reports, views, dashboards, charts, and more.  
  
 **8**. It’s a best practice to keep your customizations separate from the default solution. Create and manage your **Solutions** here.  
  
 **9**.  Go to the **Dynamics Marketplace** to find industry-specific apps on App Source.

 **15**. Use **Document Management** to set up SharePoint integration. With SharePoint, your team can work together on the same documents.

 **16**. Enable **Auditing** to track changes made to your business data.  
  
 **17**. Use **Email Configuration** to integrate Outlook or web mail systems with Dynamics 365. You can also manage and monitor mailboxes from here.

 **19**. Use **Activity Feeds Rules** to specify when posts will automatically be created for followed records.  
  
 **20**. Set up **Dynamics 365 App for Outlook**, which is an Office add-on for Microsoft Outlook. With Dynamics 365 App for Outlook, users can view Dynamics 365 data from Outlook, and can track Outlook email and appointment records with a single click.  
  
 **21**. Set up **Relationship Insights** to continuously analyze a vast collection of data to help users better understand business relationships, evaluate their activities in relation to previous successes, and choose the best path forward.  
  
 **22**. Use **Processes** to create business process flows, workflows, dialogs, and actions.  
  
 **23**. The **Interactive Service Hub** includes rich dashboards and forms that pull key information together for service workers so they can get things done faster.  
  
 **24**. Go to **My apps** to see the list of apps you can access.
