<!--, Operations, or Financials.  AMYLA: Removed these because it is not exactly the right list anymore with their name changes-->

>  If you need to setup the product catalog or other management task, or if you’re an administrator, open [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] – Custom to access functions in the Settings area.

## Find your way around the app menus
 When you open an app, you’ll see tiles and icons (called a *sitemap*) for that app. Use the icons to access different types of information relevant to that role.  
  
 The following illustrations describe the sitemaps for the  Sales, Customer Service, and [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] – Custom apps.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Your Sales or Customer Service app sitemap may be different if your app has been customized.

 **2**. Speed up the creation of articles, email, email signatures, documents, contracts, and mail-merges by creating **Templates**.

 **6**. See **Sync Errors** associated with mobile offline.  
  
 **7**. Use **Customizations** to make Dynamics 365 work the way your business does: add or remove fields, create or customize forms, reports, views, dashboards, charts, and more.  
  
 **8**. It’s a best practice to keep your customizations separate from the default solution. Create and manage your **Solutions** here.  
  
 **9**.  Go to the **Dynamics Marketplace** to find industry-specific apps on App Source.  
  
 **10**. The **Plug-In Trace Log** allows developers to use the iTracingService, and provides a way to see traces without requiring an error to occur to see the trace.  Use this item to see a grid of all the Plug-in Trace Logs per plug-in execution.

 **15**. Use **Document Management** to set up SharePoint integration. With SharePoint, your team can work together on the same documents. SharePoint integration is also required if you want to use other collaboration features like OneNote, OneDrive for Business, or Office 365 Groups with Dynamics 365.  
  
 **16**. Enable **Auditing** to track changes made to your business data.  
  
 **17**. Use **Email Configuration** to integrate Outlook or web mail systems with Dynamics 365. You can also manage and monitor mailboxes from here.

 **19**. Use **Activity Feeds Rules** to specify when posts will automatically be created for followed records.  
  
 **20**. Set up **Dynamics 365 App for Outlook**, which is an Office add-on for Microsoft Outlook. With Dynamics 365 App for Outlook, users can view Dynamics 365 data from Outlook, and can track Outlook email and appointment records with a single click.  
  
 **21**. Set up **Relationship Insights** to continuously analyze a vast collection of data to help users better understand business relationships, evaluate their activities in relation to previous successes, and choose the best path forward.  
  
 **22**. Use **Processes** to create business process flows, workflows, dialogs, and actions.  
  
 **23**. The **Interactive Service Hub** includes rich dashboards and forms that pull key information together for service workers so they can get things done faster.  
  
 **24**. Go to **My apps** to see the list of apps you can access.
