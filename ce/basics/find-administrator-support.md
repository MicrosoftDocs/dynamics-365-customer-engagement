# Find your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] administrator or support person 

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

You may occasionally run across issues that require consultation with your [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] administrator. If you donâ€™t know who your administrator is, you can use Advanced Find to find your administrator.  
  
1. Sign in to your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] organization.  
  
2. Open the Sales, Customer Service, Field Service, or Project Service Automation app, and then on the nav bar, choose the **Advanced Find** button ![Screen shot of Advanced Find button](../basics/media/advanced-find-button.PNG "Screen shot of Advanced Find button").  
  
   ![Advanced Find on Command bar in Dynamics 365](../basics/media/find-administrator-advanced-find.png "Advanced Find on Command bar in Dynamics 365")  
  
3. On the Advanced Find page, in the **Look for** list, select **Users**.  
  
4. Point to **Select**, and then select **Security Roles** from the list.  
  
5. Under **Fields**, select **Names**.  
  
6. Enter **System Administrator** in the box that says **Enter Text**. At this point, your screen should look like this:

7. Choose the **Results** button on the ribbon.  
  
   You should see a list of one or more system administrators.
