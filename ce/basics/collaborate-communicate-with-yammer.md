# Collaborate and communicate with Yammer

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

[!INCLUDE[pn_yammer](../includes/pn-yammer.md)] gives you one place to have conversations, create and edit documents, and share information with your colleagues without sending a single email or attending any meetings.  
  
 If your organization is set up to work with [!INCLUDE[pn_yammer](../includes/pn-yammer.md)], you’ll see posts on your [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] dashboard when colleagues update customer info and you can comment on their posts—asking questions, offering congratulations, and so on.  

To set up Yammer to work with Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps, see [Connect Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps to Yammer](../admin/connect-yammer.md).
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Before you can use [!INCLUDE[pn_yammer](../includes/pn-yammer.md)] within [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)], your organization needs to buy [!INCLUDE[pn_yammer](../includes/pn-yammer.md)] enterprise licenses.  
  
 When you use [!INCLUDE[pn_yammer](../includes/pn-yammer.md)] within [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)], here’s what you’ll be able to do:  
  
- **The [!INCLUDE[pn_yammer](../includes/pn-yammer.md)] newsfeed displays on your dashboard.** As you and your colleagues work with customers, you’ll stay up to date with the latest news about what’s happening, and you’ll be able to join in the conversation. Discuss project deadlines, share the latest files, gather feedback – and more.  
  
- **Colleagues receive updates on your customer interactions automatically**. When you create a new lead, convert it to an opportunity, close it, and so on, Yammer displays this news in your organization’s newsfeed automatically.  
  
- **You can share files and discuss content without ever leaving your browser.** Share documents, PDFs, images, and videos across teams quickly and easily.
