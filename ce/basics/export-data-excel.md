# Export data to [!INCLUDE[pn_Excel_short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)]

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Do you need to analyze your data from [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] and convert that data into actionable items that help you drive more sales?  Now you can do this when you export your data to [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_excel](../includes/pn-microsoft-excel.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_excel_online](../includes/pn-excel-online.md)] to do a quick data analysis. Also, analyzing large datasets is not a problem because you can export up to 100,000 rows of data.  
  
 You can choose to export static worksheets or dynamic worksheets, which you can import back into [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. If you need more advanced functions, you can export a dynamic PivotTable, which makes it very easy to organize and summarize data.  
  
 Export data to a standard [!INCLUDE[pn_Excel_short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)] file that that you can use on any device such as your phone, tablet, or desktop computer. The data is exported in the same format as you see in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. Text will remain text, numbers will remain numbers, and dates will remain dates. However, when you export data from [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] to [!INCLUDE[pn_Excel_short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)] the some cell format may change. The table below summarizes how you’ll see the data in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] and how the cell format changes when you export the data to [!INCLUDE[pn_Excel_short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)].  
  
## Cell format when data is exported from [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] to [!INCLUDE[pn_Excel_short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)]

## Other considerations

- When you export data in [!INCLUDE[pn_Excel_short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)] (.xlsx format) and then add or modify columns, you can’t import the data back in to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. This is not supported for .xlsx file format.  
  
- If you’re using [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Excel_2010_short](../includes/pn-ms-excel-2010-short.md)], \ you may get this error message when you export data from Accounts area: 
 
      “The file is corrupt and cannot be opened.”  
  
   The error message occurs due to a setting in [!INCLUDE[pn_Excel_short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)]. To fix the issue, do this:  
  
  1. Open [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Excel_2010_short](../includes/pn-ms-excel-2010-short.md)]  
  
  2. Go to **File** > **Options**.  
  
  3. Go to **Trust Center** > **Trust center settings**.  
  
  4. Click **Protected view**. Then clear the check boxes for the first two options.  
  
  5. Click **OK** and then close the **Options** dialog box.
