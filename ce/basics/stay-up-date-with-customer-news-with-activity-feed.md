# Stay up-to-date with customer news with the activity feed

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Monitor real-time updates in the activity feed to stay current with fast-moving sales, customer projects, and marketing campaigns at your organization.  
  
 You’ll find the activity feed on your dashboard under the heading **What’s new**.  
  
 The activity feed includes automatic updates about the work your colleagues are doing. You can also choose to “follow” updates for up to 1,000 of the contacts, colleagues, and customer records you care most about.  
  
## Like or unlike a post in the activity feed  
  
1. Under **What’s new**, point to the post.  
  
2. Click **Like** or **Unlike**.  
  
   Below a post, you’ll see the number of people who have liked it, and the names of people who liked the post most recently. Click the counter to see more names.  
  
## Comment on someone’s post in the activity feed  
  
1.  Under **What’s new**, point to the post.  
  
2.  Click **Reply**.  
  
3. Type your comment. You can use up to 250 characters.  
  
## Follow or unfollow a contact, account, lead, or other customer info  
 In addition to seeing any automatic posts in the activity feed, you can follow customers and other types of records – to see real-time updates to the [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] customer information you care most about.  
  
1.  Open the contact, account, lead, or other type of record you want to follow.  
  
2.  Click the **More Command** (![More commands button](../basics/media/morecommands.gif "More commands button")).  
  
3.  Click **Follow** or **Unfollow**.  
  
## Follow or unfollow a colleague  
  
1.  On your dashboard, click **Advanced Find**.  
  
2.  In the **Look for** drop-down list, click **Users**.  
  
3.  In the **Show** group, click **Results**.  
  
4.  Click the person’s name.  
  
5.  Click the **More Command** (![More commands button](../basics/media/morecommands.gif "More commands button")).  
  
6.  Click **Follow** or **Unfollow**.  
  
## Control which types of posts you see in the activity feed  
 At the top of the activity feed, you'll see commands that let you control whether you see posts about everything you follow or a smaller subset.  
  
-   Under **What’s new**, select one of the following:  
  
    - **All records**, and then select the type of records  
  
    - **Both** to see automatic posts and posts for the additional things you’re following  
  
    - **Auto posts** to see only automatic posts  
  
    - **User posts** to see only the things you’ve chosen to follow  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The activity feed in classic mode has a flyout to create new custom activity records under the ellipsis. This flyout can only contain up to 10 custom activities.

## Change the order that record types are listed in your activity feed  
 You can change the order that record types display in your activity feed so that the ones you care most about are listed at the top.  
  
1.  Under **What’s new**, click **All records**.  
  
2.  Click **Modify this list** ( ![Gear button](../basics/media/selection-rule-gear-button.gif "Gear button") ).  
  
3.  In the **Filters My Filters** dialog box, select the record types you want to change.  
  
4.  Click **Move Up** or **Move Down** to change the order the record types are displayed.  
  
5.  Close the dialog box.
