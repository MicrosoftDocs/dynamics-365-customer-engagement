# Quick create--Enter new records--fast!

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

The Quick Create command makes it fast and easy to enter almost any type of information into the system. The command is on the nav bar, so itâ€™s always available whenever you need to enter new info into the system.  
  
 With Quick Create, you need to complete only a few fields. Later, when you have more time or more information, you can fill in more details.  
  
 You can quickly create:  
- Contacts  
- Accounts  
- Leads  
- Opportunities  
- Campaign responses  
- Competitors  
- Activities: tasks, phone calls, email, or appointments  
  <!--In [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_2015_and_online_full](../includes/pn-crm-2015-and-online-full.md)] or later, when you add a new sales opportunity to the system by using the **Create** command on the nav bar, you can now create a contact at the same time. In previous versions, you had to create the contact before using the Quick Create command to add an opportunity.  
  -->  
- On the nav bar, click the **plus sign**![Quick Create button](../basics/media/filter-button.png "Quick Create button"), and then click the item you want.  
  
2.  Fill in the fields, and then click **Save**.  
  
3.  If you would like to continue adding information, click **View Record**. To create another one, click **Create Another**.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> ![Required Field button](../basics/media/required-field-button.png "Required Field button") next to the field on the screen means the field is required.  
>   
> ![Recommended Field button](../basics/media/recommended-field-button.png "Recommended Field button") next to the field on the screen means your organization recommends that you fill in the field.
