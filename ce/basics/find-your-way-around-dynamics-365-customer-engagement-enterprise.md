#### Find your way around the Sales, Customer Service, or Dynamics 365 - Custom app

 **20**. Set up **Dynamics 365 App for Outlook**, which is an Office add-on for Microsoft Outlook. With Dynamics 365 App for Outlook, users can view Dynamics 365 data from Outlook, and can track Outlook email and appointment records with a single click.
