# Use the workplace calendar

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Use the calendar to view appointments and service activities you need to participate in.  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_marketing_calendar](../includes/proc-marketing-calendar.md)]  
  
2. On the calendar, change the view by doing any of the following:  
  
   -   To change the calendar view, under **Calendar Views**, click one of the views:  
  
       - **Month**. Shows a monthly calendar.  
  
       - **Week**. Shows a weekly calendar.  
  
       - **Day**. Shows a daily calendar.  
  
   -   To view a summary of an appointment, on the calendar, place the cursor over the appointment.  
  
   -   To view or edit the details of an appointment, on the calendar, click the appointment link. The appointment form opens.  
  
3. To change the dates on the calendar, on the calendar control, click the arrows to see different months, or click a specific date.  
  
4. To view today's appointments and service activities, on the calendar control, click **Today**. The calendar displays the hourly list for today.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The calendar shows canceled and completed appointments and service activities. To remove an appointment or service activity from the calendar, delete the record.  
  
 You can create an appointment or service activity from a normal calendar as well as a service calendar. More information: [Create or edit an appointment](../basics/create-edit-appointment.md),
