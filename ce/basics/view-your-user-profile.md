# View your user profile  

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Your user profile displays useful information about you to your entire organization; for example, your contact information, your organization, and your security role. Depending on your security role, you may be able to make changes to your user profile.  
  
1. Go to **Options**.  
  
   In [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], in the upper-right corner of the screen, choose the **Settings** button ![user-profile-settings-button](media/user-profile-settings-button.gif) > **Options**.  
 
<!-- In Dynamics 365 for Outlook: Choose **File** > **Dynamics 365** > **Options**.  -->   
2.  Scroll down to the very bottom of the **Set Personal Options** dialog box, and then choose **View your user information**.  
  
3.  To check your security role, on the nav bar, choose the down arrow ![User profile security option More Options button](../basics/media/user-profile-security-option-more-button.gif "User profile security option More Options button") next to your name, and then choose **Security Roles**.
