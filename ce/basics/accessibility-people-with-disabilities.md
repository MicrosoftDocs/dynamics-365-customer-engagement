# Accessibility for people with disabilities
Microsoft is committed to making its products and services easier for everyone. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Microsoft Accessibility](http://www.microsoft.com/enable/default.aspx)  
  
## Keyboard shortcuts in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement apps 
[!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] offers keyboard shortcuts to address issues faced by people with limited dexterity or motion disabilities. Also, people who don’t use a mouse can use a keyboard to navigate and complete actions.  More information: [Use keyboard shortcuts in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement applications](../basics/keyboard-shortcuts.md)
  
## Use a screen reader in Unified Interface apps
Screen readers make Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement applications accessible to people who have low or no vision. Unified Interface apps in Dynamics 365 enable a more consistent screen reader experience. More information: [Use a screen reader with Unified Interface apps](../basics/screen-reader.md)

## Heighten color contrast of some text and images  
 The high contrast setting in [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Windows_long](../includes/pn-ms-windows-long.md)] heightens the color contrast of some text and images on your computer screen, making those items more distinct and easier to identify. You’ll find this setting on the **Ease of Access** page in [Windows 10](http://www.microsoft.com/enable/products/windows10/default.aspx).  
  
 If you’re using the high contrast setting in [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Windows_long](../includes/pn-ms-windows-long.md)], you should also select **Enable high contrast** in your [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] personal options. On your dashboard, click or tap ![Gear button](../basics/media/selection-rule-gear-button.gif "Gear button") **>** **Options**. Click or tap the **General** tab, click or tap **Enable high contrast**, and then click or tap **OK**.
