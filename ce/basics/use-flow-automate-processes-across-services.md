# Use Microsoft Flow to automate processes across services

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Microsoft Flow lets you create automated processes between your favorite apps and services. From within [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], you can run a Flow on one or more records. Also, you can open Microsoft Flow from [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] to view, edit, or create new flows.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  To manage and run Microsoft Flow from [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], Microsoft Flow must be enabled in System Settings for you organization. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Enable embedded Flow in your organization](../admin/enable-embedded-flow-in-your-organization.md)  
  
## Manage your flows  
 Connect with Microsoft Flow from [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] to manage your flows.  
  
1. On the Actions toolbar, select **Flows**.  
  
   ![Create, see, or run a flow.](../basics/media/embedflow-create.png "Create, see, or run a flow.")  
  
2. The following options appear:  
  
   -   Select **Create a flow** to open a new browser tab and direct you to the Microsoft Flow site. On the Microsoft Flow page, select Continue to use an existing template or select X to close choose or create a different one.  
  
   -   Select **See your flows** to open a new browser tab and direct you to the Microsoft Flow site where any flows in the Flow environment are displayed.  
  
   -   Select **Login to flow** to connect with Microsoft Flow and display available flows for you to run. This only appears if you aren’t currently signed in to Microsoft Flow.  
  
   -   Select a flow to run. See [Run an embedded flow from Dynamics 365](#Flow_run).

## Run an embedded flow from [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]  
 You can run a flow from views, forms, and Advanced Find.  
  
1. Select the records that you want to run the flow on, such as a selection of account records from the Active Accounts view.  
  
2. On the Actions toolbar, select **Flows**, and then under **Run** select the flow that you want to run.  
  
    Flows that include actions for entities associated with your current location in the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] app appear under Run on the Flow menu. For example, a flow that triggers whenever an account record is selected will appear in the Active Accounts view.  
  
   > [!TIP]
   >  If you don’t see any flows under Run, click **Login to flow**.

3. If required, input additional information. Then, follow the instructions on your screen to run the flow.  

## Known issues
### Flow commands do not respond from your mobile device
When you tap a Flow command, such as **Login to Flows**, **Create a Flow**, or **See your Flows**, from your mobile device, the command does not respond.

This occurs when your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] instance has the [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-9-0-0-online](../includes/pn-crm-9-0-0-online.md)], and your device has an earlier version of [!INCLUDE [pn-dyn-365-phones](../includes/pn-dyn-365-phones.md)] or [!INCLUDE [pn-dyn-365-tablets](../includes/pn-dyn-365-tablets.md)]. To work around this issue, remove the current app, and install the latest app. [Install Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/mobile-app/install-dynamics-365-for-phones-and-tablets)
