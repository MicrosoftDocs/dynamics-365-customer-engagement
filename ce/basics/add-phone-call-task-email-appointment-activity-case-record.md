# Add a phone call, task, email, or appointment activity to a case or record 

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

The activity and notes area helps you keep track of all the interactions with your customers. Record all important conversations with the customer or the communication with your team members regarding a record in [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)]. Add a phone call, task, notes, email, or appointments right within the case, account, contact, lead, or opportunity records without navigating to a different area and opening another form.  
  
 All activities that you add from within a record appear in the **Activities** area. If the **Regarding** field of an activity is set, the activity appears in the activity wall of the regarding record. You can filter the list to show just the activities that are in progress or the ones that are overdue. Click or tap the inline **Complete** link to close the activity as **Completed**.

## Add notes  
 You can also easily add notes in the activities area. And if you’re on the latest version of [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)], you have the benefits of using OneNote to take or review customer notes from within your Dynamics 365 records. For more information on OneNote, see: [Set up OneNote integration in Dynamics 365](../admin/set-up-onenote-integration-in-dynamics-365.md).  
  
 This doesn’t replace the current Notes feature, but gives you another way to access notes stored in OneNote.
