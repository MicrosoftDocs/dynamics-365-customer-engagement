# Business apps in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

[!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] now comes with role-based business apps so organizations can start with what they need to run their business, and then grow at their own pace.  
  
 These apps are simple and intuitive, and make it easier for users to quickly find the things they need to do every day.  
  
 In previous versions, when you signed in to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], you saw a single application with sales, service, and marketing areas, and a site map (menu system) with multiple entities that you may not need for the work you do. With business apps, you'll see smaller role-based, and purpose-built site maps.  
  
 System administrators and customizers can manage access to the apps by using security roles. You'll only see the apps that you've been given access to. When you open an app, you'll see data that is relevant to perform your tasks, which simplifies your working experience.  
  
 For example, if you are a customer service representative, you'll see the customer service app on the Apps page. The simplified site map in the customer service app only has service entities and settings for service management.  
  
## Default apps  
 Based on the your security role and on licensing option that your organization has chosen, you may see one or more of the following apps on your landing page:  

 - **Sales**.  A customizable relationship management app that automates sales processes, and lets you monitor performance and achieve more consistent sales interactions by following the sales process as it takes you through each stage—from creating a lead to closing the sale. 

    The Sales app also includes associated  marketing lists and campaigns, because these are used by the sales team to reach out to potential leads. Use the Marketing work area to promote your business and improve sales with targeted marketing campaigns. By default, only Sales App Access, System Administrator, and System Customizer roles have access to this app. The system administrator can assign access to other roles later. 

    To get started with sales and marketing, see [Dynamics 365 for Sales - User Guide](../sales-enterprise/user-guide.md).|  
    
-   **Customer Service**.  Empowers customer service reps  to manage cases. It also allows service managers to manage important aspects of customer service, like, setting up levels and terms for the service the organization provides to their customers, or setting up rules for automatically converting conversations into cases. By default, only Customer Service App Access, System Administrator, and System Customizer roles have access to this app. The system administrator can assign access to other roles later.  
  
     To get started with customer service, see [Dynamics 365 for Customer Service – User Guide](../customer-service/user-guide-customer-service.md).  
  
-   **Field Service**. Allows organizations to manage a field service workforce, and provides smart scheduling and resource management capabilities. It optimizes your service scheduling with efficient routing, resource skill matching, and reduced travel time. 

    To get started with field service, see [Dynamics 365 for Field Service – User Guide](../field-service/user-guide.md). 
   
-   **Project Service Automation**. Helps project managers create project quotes and contracts. It also provides analytics to help project managers ensure projects are feasible and profitable.  

     To get started with project service automation, see [Dynamics 365 for Project Service Automation – User Guide](../project-service/overview.md).
  
 - **Dynamics 365 – custom**. This app provides access to the full suite of capabilities, namely administration, settings and the legacy sales, service and marketing functionality. 
  
## Availability of business apps  
 Business apps are available in the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] web application and with the latest release are also available in [!INCLUDE[pn_moca_short](../includes/pn-moca-short.md)].  
  
 Your system administrator or a user with the required privileges can create new business apps for you. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Manage access to apps with security roles](../customize/manage-access-apps-security-roles.md) 
  
## Find your business apps  
 Apps are available to you based on your security role. You can see all the apps that are available to you on the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] home page or the My Apps page.

## Upgrading from prior versions of [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] Customer Engagement

They'll be able to access the full suite of capabilities including sales, service, and marketing, by using the Dynamics 365 - custom app that is created during the upgrade.
