# Download a report

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

To edit a default report, you can download the report from [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] to a computer that is set up with the report development environment, and then make the necessary changes.  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_reports](../includes/proc-reports.md)]  
  
2. On the **Actions**![action](../basics/media/action-button.gif "action") menu, click or tap **Download Report**.  
  
    The RDL file for the report contains tags that specify whether the report is a Fetch-based report or an SQL-based report.  
  
3. Click or tap **Save**, and specify the location in which to save the file. If youâ€™re creating a new report rather than modifying a report, rename the file.  
  
4. In the **Download Complete** dialog box, click or tap **Close**.
