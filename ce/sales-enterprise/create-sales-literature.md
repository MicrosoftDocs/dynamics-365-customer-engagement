# Manage sales literature (Sales Hub)

Sales literature in [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] stores sales-related information such as brochures or detailed specifications of products. Think of sales literature as a central repository for your organization’s sales information (in the form of sales attachments) that lets you share information with other users.

You can associate a sales literature to a competitor or a product.

## Create a sales literature record

1. [!INCLUDE[proc_permissions_admin_cust_mgr_vp_sales_ceo](../includes/proc-permissions-admin-cust-mgr-vp-sales-ceo.md)]  
  
2. Select the site map ![Site Map icon](media/site-map-icon.png "site map icon"), and then under **Collaterals**, select **Sales Literature**.

3. Select **New**.

4. Fill in the information such as **Title**, **Subject**, and **Type**. Use the handy tooltips as a guide.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Sales Literature form](media/sales-literature-form.png "Sales Literature form")

5. Select **Save**.   

5. In the **Sales Attachments** section, select the **More Commands** button ![More Command button](media/more-commands-button.png "More Command button"), and then select **New Sales Attachment**. 

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Add New Sales Attachment option](media/add-new-sales-attachment.png "Add New Sales Attachment option")

6. In the **New Sales Attachment** form, enter a **Title** and **Abstract** for the attachment, and then select **Choose File** to select a file to be attached.

7. Select **Save** or **Save & Close**.

There are two ways to send the sales literature to other users:

- Select the **Send as Email** option in the **Sales Literature** form.

- Select the **Add Sales Literature** option in [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-app-outlook](../includes/pn-dyn-365-app-outlook.md)]. [!INCLUDE[proc-more-information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Add sales literature or a knowledge base article to a email](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/outlook-app/user/add-literature-or-kb)
