# Dynamics 365 for Sales and GDPR

To comply with GDPR, weâ€™ve made it possible to edit read-only records in [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)].

The following table shows the states in which the [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] records become read-only. 

|  Entity  |  State  |
|  ------  |  -----  |
|  Quote   | Active/Closed |
|  Order   | Fulfilled/Canceled/Submitted/Invoiced |
|  Invoice | Paid/Canceled/Closed | 

In case of orders and invoices, a system administrator can export read-only records, update them, and import back to [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)]. In case of quotes, both, a system administrator and a user, can export read-only records and import the updated records back into the system. 

It is also possible to update the read-only records programmatically with the SDK for [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-365](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] Customer Engagement.

## Update read-only records through export/import

1. In your sales app, go to the list of records. For example, go to **Sales** > **Quotes**.

2. Open the view that shows all the records regardless of their state. For example, open the **All Quotes** view.

3. Select the records that you want to export, and on the command bar, select **Export to Excel** > **Static Worksheet**. More information: [Export data to Excel](../basics/export-data-excel.md)

4. In the file that you exported, make the necessary changes.

5. To import the updated records back into [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)], in your sales app, in the list of records, select **Import Data**. More information: [Import accounts, leads, or other data](../basics/import-accounts-leads-other-data.md)


## Important points

- As a system administrator, you can edit any read-only field but changes will not reflect for the locked fields. 

- If configured, Plugins, Business processes and workflows will run on fields getting updated or becoming editable. 

- In case of [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-365](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] Customer Engagement integration with any third-party system, there is a chance of GDPR requested changes to be overwritten if correct sequence of updates is not followed. It is the [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-365](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] Customer Engagement system administrator's responsibility to follow the correct order.
