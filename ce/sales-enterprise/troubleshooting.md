# Dynamics 365 for Sales troubleshooting guide for sales people

Use the following list of troubleshooting topics to quickly find information to solve your issue.

## Lead qualification issues and resolution

### How do I convert or qualify my leads?

When you determine that the lead you’ve nurtured has a potential to turn into business, you qualify a lead. When you qualify a lead, it becomes an opportunity.
To qualify a lead, select **Qualify** on the command bar of the lead record.

You can also qualify a lead from the list of leads. Go to **Sales** > **Leads**. Select the lead you want to qualify and on the command bar, select **Qualify**.

### Why am I not able to qualify a lead?
There could be multiple errors you may get while you qualify a lead. 
1.  [Duplicate warning - There might already be a match for this account or contact. If so, please select it](troubleshooting.md#duplicate)
2.  [To move to the next stage, complete the required steps](troubleshooting.md#CompleteSteps)
3.  [Active stage is not on 'lead' entity](troubleshooting.md#NoActiveStage)
4.  [Access denied or Insufficient permissions](troubleshooting.md#AccessDenied)

The following sections talk about each of these errors and how you can resolve them.

<a name="duplicate"> </a>
#### 1. Duplicate warning - There might already be a match for this account or contact. If so, please select it.

**Reason:**

When the lead is qualified to an opportunity, it automatically creates a corresponding account and/or contact and there may already be a match for this account or contact.

**Resolution:**

On the **Duplicate warning** dialog box, select the existing account or contact to avoid creating duplicates. To create a new record instead, click **Continue**.

<a name="CompleteSteps"> </a>
#### 2. To move to the next stage, complete the required steps

**Reason:** 

You have not filled in data in all the business-required fields in the current stage of the process stage.

**Resolution:**

Fill in data in all the mandatory fields in the current stage, save the record, and then try qualifying the lead again.

<a name="NoActiveStage"> </a>
#### 3. Active stage is not on 'lead' entity

**Reason:**

The lead that you are trying to qualify isn’t in the Active state. This may happen when an already-qualified lead has been reactivated.

**Resolution:**

1.	Open the lead record.
2.	On the process stage, select the Set **Active** button.

    ![Set Active button in the Qualify stage of lead form](media/set-active-button-qualify-stage.png "Set Active button in the Qualify stage of lead form")

<a name="AccessDenied"> </a> 
#### 4. Access denied or Insufficient permissions

**Reason:**

You do not have sufficient permissions on the lead record. 

**Resolution:**

Ask your system administrator to grant you the necessary permissions.


If there’s no error, and you are still not able to qualify a lead, please contact the technical support here.


## Opportunity issues and resolution

### How do I close an opportunity?
      
Whether your customer has accepted or rejected your proposal, it is a good practice to close the opportunity as won or lost. 
When you close an opportunity, the opportunity is marked as complete, and can’t be changed. If you want to make further changes to an opportunity, you can reopen it. At the time of closing the opportunity, enter the Actual Revenue and Actual Close Date. The Actual Revenue is used for reporting purposes in charts and reports in Dynamics 365 for Sales.

To close an opportunity, open the opportunity record, and on the command bar, select **Close as Won** or **Close as Lost**.

### Why am I not able to closing an opportunity?

Here are some errors that you may see while you close an opportunity. 
1.  [The opportunity cannot be closed](troubleshooting.md#CannotBeClosed)
2.  [Access denied or Insufficient permissions](troubleshooting.md#AccessDeniedOpportunity)
3.  [The opportunity has already been closed](troubleshooting.md#AlreadyClosed)

The following sections talk about each of these errors and how you can resolve them.

<a name="CannotBeClosed"> </a> 
#### 1. The opportunity cannot be closed

**Reason:**

There may be active or draft quotes associated with the opportunity.

**Resolution:**

1.	In the Opportunity record, go to the Quotes tab (or Quotes line item tab).
2.	Make sure none of the quotes are in the Draft or Active status.

    ![Quotes in the Draft status](media/quotes-in-draft-state.png "Quotes in the Draft status")


<a name="AccessDeniedOpportunity"> </a> 
#### 2. Access denied or Insufficient permissions.

**Reason:**

You do not have sufficient permissions to the opportunity you are trying to close.

**Resolution:**

Ask your system administrator to grant you the necessary permissions.

<a name="AlreadyClosed"> </a>
#### 3. The opportunity has already been closed.

**Reason:**

The opportunity that you are trying to close is already marked as Won or Lost. 

**Resolution:**

If you want to make changes to the already-closed opportunity, reopen the opportunity, make changes, and close it again.

### I am unable to edit an opportunity?

If you have already closed an opportunity as Won or Lost, it becomes read-only and you can no more change it. If you want to make any changes to the opportunity, reopen the opportunity. 

To reopen, open the opportunity, and on the command bar, select **Reopen Opportunity**.
 
![Reopen opportunity](media/reopen-opportunity.png "Reopen opportunity")

### I am unable to add products to opportunity? 

Here are some errors that you may see while you add products to an opportunity. 
1.  [You must select a price list before attempting to add a product](troubleshooting.md#SelectPriceList)
2.  [You must provide a value for product description](troubleshooting.md#ProductName)
3.  [You can only add active products](troubleshooting.md#ActiveProducts)

<a name="SelectPriceList"></a>
#### 1. You must select a price list before attempting to add a product.

**Reason**: 

You've not selected a price list for the opportunity. Selecting a price list is required to be able to add products to an opportunity. 

**Resolution:**

1.  In the Opportunity record, go to the **Product Line Item** tab.
2.  In the Price List field, select a price list for the opportunity.  

<a name="ProductName"></a>
#### 2. You must provide a value for product description.

**Reason**: 

While creating a write-in product, you've not entered the product name.  

**Resolution:**

Enter the product name.   

<a name="ActiveProducts"></a>
#### 3. You can only add active products.

**Reason**: 

While adding an existing product, you selected a product in the **Draft** status.  

**Resolution:**

Make sure the product you want to add is in the Active state, and then add the product.
