# Add a marketing list, sales literature, or product to a campaign using in-app marketing (Sales)

Add all items to your campaign that your need in this marketing context. Usually you need to add marketing lists, but you might also want to refer campaigns to products and related campaigns, or you might want to add sales literature that documents sales procedures.  

1. In the site map, select **Marketing Lists**.

2. Open a marketing list record, and then in the **Campaigns** area, open the campaign to which you want to add a list, product, or sales literature.

    The following table shows what you need to do to add each type of item.  


   |       To add       |                                      Do this                                      |
   |--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   |  A marketing list  | On the **Related** tab, select **Target Marketing Lists**, and then select **Add Existing Marketing List**. |
   |     A product      | On the **Related** tab, select **Target Products**, and then select **Add Existing Product**.        |
   |  Sales literature  | On the **Related** tab, select **Sales Literature**, and then select **Add Existing Sales Literature**.   |
   | A related campaign | On the **Related** tab, select **Related Campaigns**, and then select **Add Existing Campaign**.     |


3. Select the type of record you want in the **LookUp Records** dialog box. In the **Look for Records** box, type the first few letters of the name of the record to narrow your search, and then select the Search icon ![Search icon](../sales-enterprise/media/search-icon.png "Search icon").  

5. Select the records that you want to add in the list of records that appears, and then select **Add**.  

6. Select **Save** or **Save and Close**.  

   > [!NOTE]
   >  To verify that the item you selected was added to the campaign, reopen the campaign. Under **Marketing**, select **Target Marketing Lists**, or under **Sales** select either **Target Products** or **Sales Literature**. The information you added appears in the list.
