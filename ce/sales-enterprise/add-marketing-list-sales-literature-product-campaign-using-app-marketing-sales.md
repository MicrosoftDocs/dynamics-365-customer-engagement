# Add a marketing list, sales literature, or product to a campaign using in-app marketing (Sales)

Add all items to your campaign that your need in this marketing context. Usually you need to add marketing lists, but you might also want to refer campaigns to products and related campaigns, or you might want to add sales literature that documents sales procedures.  

1. [!INCLUDE[proc_marketing_campaigns](../includes/proc-marketing-campaigns.md)]  

2. Choose the name of the campaign that you want to add a list, product, or sales literature to. In the nav bar, click the down arrow next to your campaign.  

    The following table shows what you need to do to add each type of item.
