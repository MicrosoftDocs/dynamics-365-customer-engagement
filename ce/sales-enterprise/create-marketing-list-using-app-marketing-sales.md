# Create a marketing list using in-app marketing (Sales)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Your marketing list is the core of running a successful marketing campaign. It can include any one type of customer record, such as leads, accounts, or contacts.  
  
 You can create two types of marketing lists:  
  
- **Static** Use a static list if you prefer to add and update members manually.  
  
- **Dynamic** Use a dynamic marketing list if you want the list to return a list of members dynamically when needed, based on search criteria you set. For example, if you want to run a campaign to members of a specific city, use a dynamic list. A dynamic marketing list retrieves the updated list of members each time you open the list, create a quick campaign from the list, or distribute a campaign activity for a campaign associated with the list.
