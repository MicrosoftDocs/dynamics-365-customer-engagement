### Internet Explorer 11 support for Dynamics 365 and Microsoft Power Platform is deprecated

Effective December 2020, Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 support for Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Microsoft Power Platform is deprecated. Internet Explorer 11 won’t be supported after August, 2021. 

This will impact customers who use Dynamics 365 and Microsoft Power Platform products that are designed to be used through an Internet Explorer 11 interface. After August 2021, Internet Explorer 11 won't be supported for such Dynamics 365 and Microsoft Power Platform products. We recommend that customers transition to Microsoft Edge. 

For the complete list of products impacted by this change or for information on transitioning from Internet Explorer 11 to a supported browser, see [FAQ: Internet Explorer 11 deprecation for Dynamics 365 and Microsoft Power Platform Products](https://aka.ms/IEsupportDeprecationBAG). If you've questions, contact your Microsoft Customer Service representative or Microsoft Partner.

### Dynamic 365 Sales bot is deprecated

Effective June 2, 2020, the Dynamics 365 Sales bot, a feature that enables users to retrieve sales information through a bot within Dynamics 365 Sales app for Teams, will be deprecated. Until July 31, 2020, Microsoft will continue to provide support for the feature, but won't release any new functionality beyond what is already present. After July 31, 2020, you'll no longer be able to receive responses to conversations. The bot won’t be available for new customers. Existing customers may still be able to access the bot from the Chat, however the bot won't respond to questions.

It is our goal to deliver a powerful bot experience that allows users to retrieve and manage information. Based on usage data and feedback from our customers, we'll be working on a powerful, extensible set of capabilities and features that will allow you to intuitively access and interact with sales information—among other entities—through a bot interface. We'll keep you updated on timing for when this will be available.
