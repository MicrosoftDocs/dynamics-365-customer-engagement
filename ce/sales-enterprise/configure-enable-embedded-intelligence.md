## How to enable Embedded intelligence 

As an administrator, you can enable Embedded intelligence for your organization to use features such as Relationship assistant, Email engagement, and Auto capture.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Sales AI provides features that track behavior and collect information about contacts. Make sure you understand the related privacy issues that these features raise and enable the features only if you're certain that they don't violate any privacy policies already in place in your organization. Always take steps to protect the privacy of your contacts. 

To enable, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Sales AI**.<br>
![Select Intelligence configuration](media/intelligence-configuration-option.png "Select Intelligence configuration") <br>
2. On the **Overview** tab, select **I Accept** to accept the privacy statement for **Sales AI**.<br>
![Accept privacy statement of Embedded intelligence](media/accept-privacy-statement-embedded-intelligence.png "Accept privacy statement of Embedded intelligence") <br>

Sales AI is enabled for your organization and you can configure features such as Relationship assistant, Email engagement, and Auto capture.

## Enable and configure Relationship assistant

To enable cards such as task due today, custom activity due today, and email due today to users in your organization, you can configure Relationship assistant. 


> [!IMPORTANT]
> By enabling this feature, you consent to share data about your customers' email activity with an external system. Data imported from external systems into [!INCLUDE[pn_sales_business_doc_name](../includes/pn-sales-business-doc-name.md)] are subject to our privacy statement.

For complete details about each available action card, including details about the configuration settings available for each of them and other details, see [Action cards reference](action-cards-reference.md).  

### Prerequisites
Assign user privileges to give access to the Relationship assistant features. The privileges required to access embedded intelligence features are automatically enabled for all out-of-the-box security roles, but they're initially disabled for all custom roles. If you enable any embedded intelligence features, you must check the settings listed in the following table to help ensure that your users can access those features, and to help ensure that other features don't stop working because of privilege cascades related to these features.

|Privilege| Security role tab |Description and requirements|
|--|--|--|
|**Action Card**| **Core Records**  |Gives the ability to view and interact with action cards that are generated by Relationship assistant. **Warning:** If Relationship assistant is enabled, all users *must* have a role with read access for this privilege. Because of cascading, users without this privilege will lose access to many [!INCLUDE[pn_sales_business_doc_name](../includes/pn-sales-business-doc-name.md)] features when Relationship assistant is enabled.|
| **Action Card User Settings** | **Core Records**  | Gives the ability to view and change user preferences for action cards that are generated by Relationship assistant. **Warning:** If Relationship assistant is enabled, all users *must* have a role with read access for this privilege. Because of cascading, users without this privilege will lose access to many [!INCLUDE[pn_sales_business_doc_name](../includes/pn-sales-business-doc-name.md)] features when Relationship assistant is enabled. |

### How to configure Relationship assistant

1. Go to **Settings** > **Sales AI**.
2. To open the Relationship assistant configuration page, select **Configure** on the **Relationship assistant** tile or select the **Relationship assistant** tab.<br>
   ![Select Relationship assistant configuration](media/relationship-assistant-configuration.png "Select Relationship assistant configuration") <br>    
3. Configure which cards to use in your organization and fine tune their behavior. Work with these settings as follows:
   - Cards are categorized by type, such as **Base** and **Advanced**. By default, the advanced cards are not enabled. To enable the advanced cards, select the check box in the **Advancd Cards** section.
   - Enable or disable specific action cards as needed by using the check boxes provided for each card.
   - Some cards have extra configuration settings that modify their behavior. These settings are provided to the right of the check box for only the relevant cards.<br>
   
   ![Relationship assistant configuration page](media/relationship-assistant-configuration-page.png "Relationship assistant configuration page") <br>
   
    > [!NOTE]
    > When custom action cards are created in your organization, an option to enable these cards are displayed under **Extended Cards** section. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Create custom cards in Relationship assistant](extend-relationship-assistant-card.md)  

4. On top of the page, select **Save** to save your settings.<br> 

Users can also set their own personal preferences for their action cards. They can't add cards that you disable here, but they can disable cards that you have enabled if they don't find them useful. They can also change the configuration settings for those cards that have them, though your settings will be the defaults.

## Enable Email engagement
Enabling the Email engagement helps the user in your organization to receive alerts and reminders that help build customer relationships.
> [!NOTE]
> If you enable Email engagement, we strongly recommend that you also enable Relationship assistant, because Email engagement relies on some of its features.
