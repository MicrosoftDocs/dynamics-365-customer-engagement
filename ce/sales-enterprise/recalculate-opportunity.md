# Recalculate an opportunity (Sales Hub)

To change the estimated revenue or total amount of an opportunity based on any changes you've made to the associated products or product quantities, recalculate the opportunity.

1. In the list of opportunities, open the opportunity for which you want to recalculate the estimated revenue.

2. Go to the **Product Line Items** tab, and verify that **Revenue** is set to **System Calculated**.

3. In the grid, modify the list of products associated with the opportunity.

4. Select **Save**.

5. On the command bar, select **Recalculate Opportunity**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If there are any changes to existing opportunity products associated with closed opportunities, the prices aren't recalculated.
