# Delete or deactivate an assignment rule

You can deactivate or delete an assignment rule that's no longer required in your organization. Deactivation keeps the rule, but it won't be used to assign leads to any sellers in the future. Deleting the rule removes it from the application, but leads that were already assigned to sellers through the rule won't be affected.

1.	Sign in to your Dynamics 365 Sales Hub app.

2.	Go to the **Change area** ![change area](media/change-area-icon.png) in the lower-left corner of the page, and select **Sales Insights settings**.   

3.	Under **Sales accelerator**, select **Assignment rules (preview)**.   


4.	On the **Assignment rules** page in the **Rules** section, select the rule and do one of the following:

    -	To deactivate the rule, turn off the toggle in the **Active** column.

        >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
        >![Deactivate a rule](media/sa-ar-deactivate-rule.png "Deactivate a rule")

    -	To delete the rule, select **More options** **&vellip;**,  and then select **Delete**.    

        >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
        >![Delete a rule](media/sa-ar-delete-rule.png "Delete a rule")    

        In the confirmation message that appears, select **Delete permanently**.

        >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
        >![Confirmation message for deleting a rule](media/sa-ar-delete-rule-confirmation-message.png "Confirmation message for deleting a rule")
