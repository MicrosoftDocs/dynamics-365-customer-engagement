You can schedule automatic data updates to ensure that you can always make the most informed and timely decisions. You can also create your own custom Power BI dashboards based on the reports in these template apps and embed them directly in Dynamics 365 Sales. 

## Sales Analytics for Dynamics 365 Sales

Sales managers are responsible for managing sales representatives who work with customers to close deals every day. Sales managers need to have visibility over key operational and pipeline metrics to drive team performance.

Managers can see trends in these metrics over a period of time to understand how sellers are performing, so that they can take corrective measures, provide appropriate guidance to sellers, and improve the customer purchase experience.

As a sales manager, use this dashboard to perform the following tasks:

- Monitor the sales pipeline, sales leaderboard, and top deals.
- Analyze pipeline performance, won/lost deals, and lead closure.

## Process Analytics for Dynamics 365

The Process Analytics for Dynamics 365 Power BI template app is designed to help sales enablement managers get insights into the performance of their business process flows.  
Sales enablement managers can track key performance indicators, including the velocity of records through process stages to understand how efficient their organizational processes are, and fine-tune process definitions to achieve maximum efficiency.

As a sales enablement manager, use this template app to perform the following tasks:

- Track business process performance.
- Create custom dashboards that focus on just one business process.
