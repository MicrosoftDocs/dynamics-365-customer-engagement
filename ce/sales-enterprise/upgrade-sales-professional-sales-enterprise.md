# Move from Dynamics 365 for Sales Professional to Dynamics 365 for Sales Enterprise

[!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] Professional is targeted at businesses that have simpler sales needs and do not require the full sales capabilities. However, if at any point you find your requirements growing, you can easily upgrade to [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] Enterprise. 

The upgrade process involves three steps:

1. Purchasing a [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] Enterprise subscription.

2. Assigning [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] Enterprise licenses to the users.

3. Installing the [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] Enterprise edition solution.

4. Deleting the [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] Professional solution. 

## Purchase Dynamics 365 for Sales Enterprise Edition subscription
