# Define lead qualification experience

Give your salespeople the flexibility to choose which records to create—account, contact, or opportunity—when a lead is qualified. 

To define the experience: 

1.  In your app, select the **Settings** icon, and then select **Advanced Settings**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Advanced Settings option on the Settings menu](media/advanced-settings-option.png "Advanced Settings option on the Settings menu")

    The **Business Management** page opens.

2.	Select **Settings**, then **Administration**, and then **System Settings**.

3.	Select the **Sales** tab.

4.	Under **Qualify lead experience**, set **Create Account, Contact, and Opportunity records by default upon qualifying a lead** to **No**.

This prompts salespeople to select which record types to be created once a lead is qualified. 

If you set **Create Account, Contact, and Opportunity records by default upon qualifying a lead** to **Yes**, Account, Contact, and Opportunity records are created by default. 

This behavior is applicable on all the leads that are qualified after this setting is updated.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> With the February 2020 early access release, you can find this setting in the Sales Hub App Settings area itself. To go to this setting:
> 1. At the bottom of the site map, select **Change area** ![Icon to change the work area](media/change-area-icon.png "Icon to change the work area") and then select **App Settings**. 
> 2. In the site map, select **Overview**, and on the **Overview** page, select **Manage** for **Auto-create records for newly qualified leads**.
