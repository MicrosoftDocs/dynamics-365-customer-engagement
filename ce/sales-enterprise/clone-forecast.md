# Clone a forecast

When you clone a forecast, you duplicate any configurations you made previously. You can work on this cloned forecast as a draft for a new forecast that better meets your needs. You retain the configurations you want, make edits to others, and create a new forecast that matches your requirements. After you make the changes, you can save and activate the cloned forecast.

**To clone a forecast**

1. Sign in to the Sales Hub app.

2. In the site map, select **Change area** ![Change area](media/change-area-icon.png), and then select **App Settings**.

3. Under **Performance management**, select **Forecast configuration**.    
    The forecast configuration page opens.

4. On the forecast that you want to clone, select **More options** ![More options](media/more-commands-icon.png), and then select **Clone**.   
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]    
    > ![Clone the forecast](media/forecast-select-clone.png "Clone the forecast")   

5. In the message that appears, select **OK**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]    
    > ![Select OK in the confirmation message](media/forecast-clone-confirmation-message.png "Select OK in the confirmation message")    

    The clone of the selected forecast is opened in edit mode.

6. Edit the forecast to meet your needs, and then activate it.
