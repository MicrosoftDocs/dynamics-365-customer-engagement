# Insight cards reference

Insight cards help keep you up to date with your work in Dynamics 365 Sales, letting you know when you need to follow-up on an email, attend a meeting, and much more. They're displayed throughout the application to provide relevant information for the context you're working in. The cards are generated by the assistant based on data stored in Dynamics 365 Sales and your [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] inbox and calendar. This topic lists each of the available cards and provides details about what each card does, how it gets generated, and how you can use it. More information: [Use Sales Insights Assistant to guide customer communications](assistant.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Your system administrator must enable the assistant before you can try it out. For prerequisites, how to enable the feature, and how to set it up, see [Configure Sales Insights Assistant](configure-assistant.md).  

The assistant displays cards in the following categories:

- [Upcoming meetings](#upcoming-meetings)

- [Reminders](#reminders)

- [Insights](#insights)
  
## Upcoming meetings

The following cards are available under **Upcoming meetings**.

>[!NOTE]
>The standard insight card types are available to you with the Sales Enterprise license.
