# Action cards reference

Applies to Dynamics 365 (online), version 9.0.2<br>

*Action cards* help keep you up to date with your work in [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)], letting you know when you need to follow up on an email, attend a meeting,  and much more. They are displayed throughout the application to provide relevant information for the context you are working in at the moment. They are generated by the relationship assistant based on data stored in [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] and your [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] inbox and calendar ([!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [ Relationship assistant](../sales-enterprise/relationship-assistant.md)). This topic lists each of the available cards and provides details about what each card does, how it gets generated, and how you can use it.  
  
 The administrator must enable the relationship assistant before you can try it out. For complete details about prerequisites, how to enable the feature, and how to set it up, see [Configure and enable embedded intelligence](../sales-enterprise/embedded-intelligence.md).

<a name="ExchangeCards"></a>   

## Email cards from Exchange  
 These action cards are generated based on an analysis of email messages in your [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Exchange](../includes/pn-microsoft-exchange.md)] inbox.  
  
 When you receive an email, [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] work together to scan the body of the email looking for certain words or phrases that suggest that the email is related to your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] work.  
  
 When the system finds relevant text, it generates an action card  to notify you of a possible action for you to take. Each signal type has its own card, which provides the information and action links best suited for that signal type.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - These cards only available if you are using [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)] with [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Exchange_Online](../includes/pn-microsoft-exchange-online.md)] as your email server. 
> - You will need to [set up server-side-sync](../admin/set-up-server-side-synchronization-of-email-appointments-contacts-and-tasks.md).
