# Create or edit an invoice (Sales and Sales Hub)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

When a customer places an order, you can create an invoice to bill them for the upcoming sale.  
  
Typically, you convert an order into an invoice. However, you can also create an invoice that does not originate from an order.

## Create an invoice from an order  

1. [!INCLUDE[proc_sales_orders](../includes/proc-sales-orders.md)]  

    or

    In the Sales Hub app, select the site map ![Site Map icon](media/site-map-icon.png "site map icon"), and then select **Orders**. 
  
2. Select the order you want to create an invoice from.  
  
3. Select **Create Invoice** at the top of the screen.  
  
4. Review the contents of the invoice and make any additions or corrections before sending to your customer.  

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Your base record and all its line items must use the same currency. For example, if your invoice has the currency set to U.S Dollars, you must use the same currency for the price list items that you add to the invoice. You canâ€™t change the currency of the base record (in this case, an invoice), unless you remove all the line items associated with the record.
> Similarly, if the invoice is created from an order that's created from a quote created from an opportunity , it must use the same currency as the opportunity.

## Create an invoice  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_sales_invoices](../includes/proc-sales-invoices.md)]  

    or

    In the Sales Hub app, select the site map ![Site Map icon](media/site-map-icon.png "site map icon"), and then select **Invoices**. 
  
2. Select **New**.  
  
3. Add your customer's contact information.  
  
4. Select **Save** in the upper-left corner to create the invoice record.  
  
5. To add products from your opportunity to your order, select **Get Products** at the top of the screen, select your opportunity, and then select **OK**.  
  
6. To add information about a product on the invoice, in the **Products** area, select **Add a Product** ![Add button](../sales-enterprise/media/add-button.PNG "Add button"), and then select one of the following options:  
  
   - **Existing Product**: A product created in the product catalog that is associated with a price list  
  
   - **Write-in Product**: A product that is available but not a part of the product catalog  
  
   - **Get Products**: Products from a previously created opportunity  
  
     You need to enter the tax amount when you add a product to a quote, order, or invoice. [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] doesn't automatically calculate tax for individual products. However, the total tax is calculated automatically based on the sum of the tax amounts for all of the individual products in a quote, order, or invoice.  
  
7. In the **Shipping Information** area, enter shipping details.  
  
8. In the **Addresses** area, enter shipping and billing addresses.  
  
9. Select **Save** in the lower-right corner of the screen.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You close an invoice either by canceling the invoice or setting the invoice status as paid.
