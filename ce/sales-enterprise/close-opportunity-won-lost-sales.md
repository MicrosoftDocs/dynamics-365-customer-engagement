If your customer has accepted your proposal, congratulations! However, whether your customer accepted or declined your proposal, it's now time to close that opportunity.  
  
1. If you're using the Sales Hub app, in the site map, select **Opportunities**. 
   
   OR

   In the Sales module, go to **Sales** > **Opportunities**.
  
2. Open the opportunity you want to edit.  
  
3. At the top of the **Opportunity** form, do one of the following:  

   - To close your opportunity as won, select **Close as Won**.  
 
   - To close your opportunity as lost, select **Close as Lost**.
