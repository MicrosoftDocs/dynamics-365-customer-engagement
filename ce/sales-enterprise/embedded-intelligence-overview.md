# Embedded intelligence overview

We're introducing a new suite of features called  *Relationship Insights*, which continuously analyzes the vast collection of customer-interaction data already stored in your [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Exchange](../includes/pn-microsoft-exchange.md)] systems, to help you better understand your business relationships, evaluate your activities in relation to previous successes, and choose the best path forward.  
  
Relationship Insights includes the following features, which all work together to amplify their individual strengths:  
  
-   Relationship assistant  
  
-   Email engagement  
  
-   Auto capture  

All of these features are available as preview features in the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_8_2_0_online](../includes/pn-crm-8-2-0-online.md)] and are only available in North American sites that use US English (en-us). Some basic features of the relationship assistant are also available in the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_8_2_0_op](../includes/pn-crm-8-2-0-op.md)]. Additional restrictions apply depending on which versions of [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Exchange](../includes/pn-microsoft-exchange.md)] you are running. For complete details about how to enable these preview features, plus version requirements, prerequisites, and any known issues, see [Configure and enable embedded intelligence](configure-enable-embedded-intelligence.md).  
  
A preview feature is a feature that is not complete, but is made available before it’s officially in a release so customers can get early access and provide feedback. Preview features aren’t meant for production use and may have limited or restricted functionality.  
  
When fully included in the product, Relationship Insights will help salespeople work more effectively while nurturing and enhancing their business relationships.

## Getting started  
 The administrator must enable each Relationship Insights feature before you can try it out. For complete details about prerequisites, how to enable each feature, and how to set them up, see [Configure and enable embedded intelligence](../sales-enterprise/configure-enable-embedded-intelligence.md).  
  
<a name="Assistant"></a>   

## The relationship assistant automatically shows you the right information at the right time  
 The relationship assistant is constantly at work, keeping an eye on your activities, records, and communications with customers. It analyzes your daily actions and communications and uses them to drive insights that help you focus on what’s important today, and how to optimize your communications to help nurture healthy business relationships going forward.  
  
 ![Relationship assistant](../sales-enterprise/media/relationship-assistant.png "Relationship assistant")  
  
 The assistant combines and analyzes all of the information at its disposal, and then generates a collection of *action cards*, which are displayed as your entry point to [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] on mobile devices, and as a carousel or column display on your web-based dashboards. When working with individual records you’ll see the action cards that apply directly to that record (all record types are supported, including custom entities). Many different types of cards are available, each of which provides tailored information, helpful links, and action controls for working with that information.  
  
 ![Relationship insights action cards](../sales-enterprise/media/relationship-insights-action-cards.png "Relationship insights action cards")  
  
 The system reminds you of upcoming activities; it evaluates your communications and suggests when it might be time to reach out to a contact that’s been inactive for a while; it identifies email messages that may be waiting for a reply from you; it alerts you when an important opportunity is nearing its close date; and much more.

<a name="EmailEngagement"></a>   

## Get more out of email with email engagement  
 *Email engagement* helps you create more effective email messages—and to learn how your contacts are interacting with them. Stay on top of your email and prioritize those prospects or customers that are most engaged.  
  
 ![Relationship insights email engagement](../sales-enterprise/media/relationship-insights-email-engagement.png "Relationship insights email engagement")  
  
 When writing a new message, get started quickly by choosing the most effective content template, with recommendations based on previous open and reply rates.  
  
 Create *followed* email messages, which let you know when a recipient opens the email, clicks a link, opens an attachment, or sends a reply.  
  
 Write your messages when it's convenient for you, but schedule delivery for when they're most likely to be noticed and read by  recipients. The system even checks recipients' time zones to provide  advice about when the best delivery times might be.  
  
 Set yourself a reminder for when it’s time to follow up on a message. Your reminder is provided as an action card displayed by the relationship assistant, so it will be brought to your attention right away. Each card includes links to help you investigate, act upon, snooze, or dismiss the card.  
  
 ![Relationship intelligence action card reminder](../sales-enterprise/media/relationship-intelligence-action-card-reminder.png "Relationship intelligence action card reminder")  
  
 You can view the status and history of your followed messages anywhere they are shown in [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)]. The current status and most-recent interaction are shown right in the **Activities** list for any record where the email is relevant, and you can expand the listing to see the full interaction history.  
  
 To protect the privacy preferences of your customers, you can choose to not allow followed messages for individual contacts by setting a flag on their contact or lead record.

<a name="AutoCapture"></a>   

## Find and track relevant messages from your Exchange server with auto capture  
 [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] can now analyze your email messages directly in [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Exchange](../includes/pn-microsoft-exchange.md)] to find all messages that might be relevant to your work in [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)]. The system looks for messages to or from relevant email addresses, and presents you with the relevant messages right in [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)]. With just one click, you can track any of the suggested messages in [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)], which makes them available to your sales team and also for use by other Relationship Insights features.  
  
 ![Relationship insights auto capture](../sales-enterprise/media/relationship-insights-auto-capture.png "Relationship insights auto capture")  
  
 You can still track messages in [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] in all the ways that you could before, including by using the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_app_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-app-for-outlook-short.md)] or tracked folders. All tracked messages in [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] are available to Relationship Insights features.
