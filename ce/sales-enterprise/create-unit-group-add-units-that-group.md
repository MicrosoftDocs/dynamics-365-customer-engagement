# Create a unit group and add units to that group (Sales and Sales Hub)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Units are the quantities or measurements that you sell your products or services in. For example, if you sell gardening supplies, you might sell seeds in units of packets, boxes, and pallets. A unit group is a collection of these different units.  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)], you first create a unit group and then create units within that group. Let's look at both of these tasks, using seeds as our example.  
 
## Create a unit group and add units (Sales Hub app)

Currently, creating a unit group or adding units isn't supported in the Sales Hub app. To create or edit a unit group and unit, use the Sales app.


## Step 1: Create a unit group (Sales app)
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_permissions_mgr_vp_ceo_busmgr_sysadmin_syscust](../includes/proc-permissions-mgr-vp-ceo-busmgr-sysadmin-syscust.md)]  
  
    #### Check your security role  
  
   - [!INCLUDE[proc_follow_steps_in_link](../includes/proc-follow-steps-in-link.md)]  
  
   - [!INCLUDE[proc_dont_have_correct_permissions](../includes/proc-dont-have-correct-permissions.md)]  
  
2. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_prod_catalog](../includes/proc-settings-prod-catalog.md)]  
  
3. Select **Unit Groups**.  
  
4. To create a new unit group, select **New**.  
  
    -OR-  
  
    To edit a unit group, open a unit group from the list.  
  
5. Fill in your information:  
  
   - **Name**. Type a meaningful name for the unit group. In our example, you would type "Seeds."  
  
   - **Primary Unit**. Type the lowest common unit of measure that the product will be sold in. In our example, you would type "packet." Other examples could include ounces, hours, or tons, depending on your product or service.  
  
     ![Shows how to create a unit group in Dynamics 365](../sales-enterprise/media/v7-unit-group-mobile-single.png "Shows how to create a unit group in Dynamics 365 for Sales")  
  
6. Select **OK**.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You cannot delete the primary unit in a unit group.  
  
## Step 2: Create units in a unit group  (Sales app)
  
1. In the unit group record you want to add the units to, on the nav bar, select the arrow next to the record name, and then under **Common**, select **Units**.

   ![Arrow in the Unit Group record](media/arrow-unit-group-record.png "Arrow in the Unit Group record")

   ![Select Units in the Unit group record](media/add-units-in-unit-group-record.png "Select Units in the Unit group record")
  
2. Select **Add New Unit**.  
  
     The unit that you specified as the primary unit earlier is already in the list of units.  
  
3. Fill in your information:  
  
   1. **Name**. Type a meaningful name for the unit. In our example, you would type "box."  
  
   2. **Quantity**. Type the quantity that this unit will contain. For example, if a box contains 12 packets, you would type "12."  
  
   3. **Base Unit**. Select a base unit. The base unit will establish the lowest unit of measurement for the unit you're creating. Using our example, you would select "packet."  
  
        If you then create a unit called "pallet," and one pallet contains 48 boxes, you would type "48" in **Quantity** and select "box" in **Base Unit**.  
  
      Here's how:  
  
   ![Create a unit in the unit group in Dynamics 365](../sales-enterprise/media/v7-unit-pack.png "Create a unit in the unit group in Dynamics 365 for Sales")  
  
   ![Creating a unit with a base unit in Dynamics 365](../sales-enterprise/media/v7-unit-box.png "Creating a unit with a base unit in Dynamics 365 for Sales")  
  
4. Select **Save** or **Save and Close**.
