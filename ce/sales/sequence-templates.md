# Sequence templates

Sequence templates provide a set of activities to guide sellers with the next best action to take in a specific scenario.

## Using sequence templates

You can use sequence templates to quickly get started with sequences. Sequence templates provide a set of activities to guide sellers with the next best action to take in a specific scenario, such as getting introduced to a lead and winning the deal.

Sequence templates are available for common scenarios, such as an incoming lead on a website. You can customize the template by adding and removing steps in accordance with your organization's requirements. The following templates are available by default:  

- [Follow up when contacts don't show up](#follow-up-when-contacts-dont-show-up)  
- [High volume outbound prospecting](#high-volume-outbound-prospecting)  
- [Invite to an upcoming event](#invite-to-an-upcoming-event)  
- [Meeting for product demo requests](#meeting-for-product-demo-requests)  
- [Upcoming account renewal](#upcoming-account-renewal)  
- [Webinar follow up](#webinar-follow-up)
