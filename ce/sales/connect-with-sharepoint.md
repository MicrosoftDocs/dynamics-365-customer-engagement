# Integrate with SharePoint

Store documents related to Dynamics 365 Sales records in SharePoint. Quickly access, share, and manage these documents from the Sales app by integrating with SharePoint Online.

## License and role requirements

| Requirement type | You must have |  
|-----------------------|---------|
| **License** | Dynamics 365 Sales Premium, Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise, or Dynamics 365 Sales Professional <br>More information: [Dynamics 365 Sales pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/) |
| **Security roles** | System Administrtor, Sales Manager, Sales Professional Manager, or Vice President of Sales <br>  More information: [Predefined security roles for Sales](security-roles-for-sales.md)|


## Configure the integration

Depending on the Dynamics 365 Sales license you have, select one of the following tabs for specific information:

# [Sales Premium and Sales Enterprise](#tab/SE)

### Prerequisites

You must have one of the following licenses:

- SharePoint Online subscription
- Microsoft 365 subscription (includes SharePoint Online)

### Steps to integrate

1. Follow the instructions in [Manage your documents using SharePoint](/power-platform/admin/manage-documents-using-sharepoint?context=/dynamics365/context/sales-context) to configure the integration. 

# [Sales Professional](#tab/SP)

### Prerequisites

You must have one of the following licenses:

- SharePoint Online subscription
- Microsoft 365 subscription (includes SharePoint Online)

### Integrate with SharePoint

1. In the site map, select **Sales Settings**, and then under **Standard settings**, select **Connect SharePoint**.

2. On the **Connect SharePoint to Dynamics 365 Sales** page, enter your organization’s SharePoint address, and select **Connect SharePoint**.

    The following configuration happens in the background:

    1. A SharePoint subsite is created with the SharePoint default root URL. This URL is used to configure SharePoint. For example, a subsite /Dynamics 365/*orgname* is created under tenant.sharepoint.com.

    2. The SharePoint site is validated.

        By default, SharePoint is enabled for the following entities:

        - Account  

        - Contact  

        - Lead  

        - Opportunity  

        - Quote  

        - Invoice  

        - Product  

        - Appointment  

        - Task  

        - Phone Call

        The folder structure is created based on the **Account** entity. This means that the folders are created under the folder for the related account. For example, the following folder structure is created for a document for the opportunity record “100 Bikes” that has a related account, Margie’s travel:

        `:.../account/Margie's Travel/opportunity/100 Bikes&lt;entityGUID&gt;.`

        You’ll see a confirmation message when SharePoint is successfully configured.

3. If any error occurs during configuration, a message is shown. Errors can occur if there are issues with permissions or issues while validating a site or creating a folder.

4. Select **Retry**.

    All the back-end configuration steps are performed again in the background.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If issues persist, follow the instructions in [Set up Dynamics 365 apps to use SharePoint Online](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/set-up-dynamics-365-online-to-use-sharepoint-online).
