# Clone a forecast 

When you clone a forecast, you duplicate any configurations you made previously. You can work on this cloned forecast as a draft for a new forecast that better meets your needs. You retain the configurations you want, make edits to others, and create a new forecast that matches your requirements. After you make the changes, you can save and activate the cloned forecast.
