## What are unit groups and units?

Units are the quantities or measurements that you sell your products or services in. For example, if you sell gardening supplies, you might sell seeds in units of packets, boxes, and pallets. A unit group is a collection of these different units.  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)], you first create a unit group and then create units within that group. 

> [!NOTE]
> The Unit group table inherits its privileges from the Product table. For example, if a user has read and write privileges on the Product table, they get the same privileges on the Unit group table too.  

Let's look at both of these tasks, using seeds as our example.  
 
## Create a unit group and add units

1. Depending on the sales app that you're using, do one of the following:
 
    -  If you're using the Sales Hub app, 
  
        1. Select **Change area** ![Icon to change the work area.](media/change-area-icon.png "Icon to change the work area") at the lower-left corner of the site map, and then select **App Settings**. 
    
        1. In the **Product Catalog** area, select **Unit Groups**. 
  
   - If you're using the Sales Professional app, 

       - Select **Unit Groups** from the site map.

4. To create a new unit group, on the command bar, select **New**.

5.	Fill in your information, and select **OK**:

    a.	**Name**. Type a meaningful name for the unit group. In our example, you would type "Televisions."

    b.	**Primary Unit**. Type the lowest common unit of measure that the product will be sold in. In our example, you would type "Piece." Other examples could include box, cartons, ounces, hours, or tons, depending on your product.

      > [!NOTE]
      > You cannot delete the primary unit in a unit group.

6.	To add units to the unit group, select the **Related** tab, and then select **Units**.

7.	On the **Units** tab, youâ€™ll see that the primary unit is already added. Select **Add New Unit**.

8.	In the **Quick Create: Unit** form, fill in the following, and select **Save**:

    a.	**Name**. Type a meaningful name for the unit. In our example, you would type "box."

    b.	**Quantity**. Type the quantity that this unit will contain. For example, if a box contains 2 pieces, you would type "2."

    c.	**Base Unit**. Select a base unit. The base unit will establish the lowest unit of measurement for the unit you're creating. Using our example, you would select "Piece."
