# Edit an active sequence and view version history 

When you've changed the process of an active sequence, you can create a new version of the sequence without deactivating it. You can update a sequence multiple times, and when you connect a record to the sequence, the record will be connected to the latest version.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The records that were connected to a previous version of the sequence remain connected to that previous version.

1.	To view the version history, select **Show full version history** from the dropdown list beside the sequence name.

    :::image type="Select version history option" source="media/sequence-version-select-version-history.png" alt-text="Select version history option":::

    A list of versions that exist for the sequence is displayed on the right pane.

    The current selected version is highlight with a blue line corresponding to the version name.

    A list of leads that are connected to the sequence is displayed, along with the version to which they're connected.
