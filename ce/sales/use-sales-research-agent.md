# Analyze your sales performance using the Sales Research Agent (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

The Sales Research Agent is an AI-based research canvas that reasons over an organization’s most complex business problems based on its sales and business data. The agent helps sales leaders understand business performance and make evidence-based decisions to improve sales outcomes.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-note.md)]

Ask the agent a question about your business data, and it will generate a blueprint&mdash;a summary of its analysis and recommendations with supporting charts and graphs. You can then instruct the agent to explore a follow-on question or ask it to tailor the summary or data visualizations to get the output that suits your needs best. Research and analysis that used to take weeks is now done in minutes, leading to faster decision-making based on data.


## Start your research journey

1. In the Sales Hub site map, go to **My Work** > **Sales Research Agent**.  
   The **Sales Research Agent** page opens with suggested research topics and a prompt box.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The agent availability is subject to usage limits and capacity throttling. If your organization doesn't have enough credits, you won't be able to generate a blueprint or interact with it. Reach out to your administrator to increase Copilot Studio capacity.


1. Do one of the following actions:

   - **Select a suggested research topic:** 

       1. Select a topic from the suggested research topics.  
          The agent automatically uses the Dynamics 365 Sales data and generates a blueprint with the research findings and visualizations based on the selected topic.

   - **Type your sales question or research topic**
       1. In the **Ask any business question** prompt box, type your sales question or research topic. The agent is connected to the Dynamics 365 Sales data by default.
       
       1. (Optional) Select **Add data** to upload files (CSV, Excel, PDF) to augment your research with additional data or use uploaded data as the only source. Learn more about connecting to data sources in [Connect the Sales Research Agent to a different data source](sales-research-agent-connect-data.md).
       1. Select **Generate**.
   
    The agent analyzes your data and generates a blueprint with the research findings and visualizations based on your question and data. 

    The following screenshot shows an example of a research blueprint generated by the agent.

    |Number  |Menu  |Description  |
    |---------|---------|---------|
    |1     | Workspace         | Displays the workspace name. You can rename the workspace by selecting the pencil icon. Select the Hamburger icon at the top-left corner to switch between workspaces and create a new workspace. |
    |2     | Data | Specifies the data source used for the research. You can add additional data sources by selecting **Add data**. |
    |3     |  Manage your context       | Lets you add additional context to help the agent tailor its research findings to your industry, role, and business needs. Learn more in [Provide context to the agent](sales-research-agent-provide-context.md). |
    |4     |  Journey lines    | Displays the journey lines that represent the questions you asked during the research process that led to the conclusion of your research journey. |
    |5     |AI cursor | Allows you to [interact with the visualization on the blueprint](#interact-with-the-visualizations). You can click on a data visualization to modify it, add more data, or ask a question. |
    |6     | Blueprint         | Displays the research findings and visualizations generated by the agent. You can interact with the visualization to explore the insights further. The research findings are displayed in the left pane. Depending on your question, the agent generates rich insights from your underlying data. Select the **Show work** icon (:::image type="icon" source="media/sales-research-agent-show-work.png" border="false":::) to view the research plan, data sources, data analysis, and visualizations that the agent used to generate the research findings. |

## Interact with the visualizations

Use the AI cursor to interact with the generated data or ask a new question about the content on the blueprint. The agent responds to natural language questions and provides contextual recommendations as you navigate the content.

1. Hover over the blueprint and select the AI cursor icon :::image type="icon" source="media/ai-cursor.png" border="false"::: or use the keyboard shortcut Alt + C to activate the AI cursor. You can ask the agent to do the following:
    - Select a question or statement from the suggestions list. The suggestions are based on the content and context of the area you selected.
    - Ask your own question or make a statement about the content on the blueprint. For example, you can ask, "Show me the sales trend for the last quarter" or "What are the top products by revenue?"
    - Ask the agent to use another chart type, group by something else, or explain what an acronym means in your source data to help get better results. When you press Enter, it generates a new blueprint instead of updating an existing block on the current blueprint.

1. (Optional) Select the **+** icon to add data files (CSV, PDF, or Excel) to help the agent answer the follow-up questions.
1. Select **Generate** and choose whether you want to update the existing block or generate a new blueprint.
   :::image type="content" source="media/sales-research-agent-ai-cursor.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the AI cursor icon and dialog on the blueprint.":::

   If you select **Update existing block**, the agent updates the existing block with the new information. If you select **Generate new blueprint**, the agent creates a new blueprint and adds a journey line to the existing blueprint.

## Refresh or regenerate the blueprint

To refresh the blueprint with the latest data or regenerate it with new visualizations and insights, select the **Refresh** icon at the top-right corner of the blueprint.
