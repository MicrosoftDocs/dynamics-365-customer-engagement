# Use Copilot's form fill assistance

[!INCLUDE [form-filling-assistance](~/../shared-content/shared/dynamics365-core/form-filling-assistance.md)]

## Example scenarios

Here are some real-world scenarios where AI-powered form fill assistance can significantly improve your productivity and data accuracy:

### Auto fill scenarios

Reduce repetitive data entry and ensure consistency when creating records based on existing customer relationships and historical data.

- **Following up on existing accounts:** When you create a new opportunity for an existing customer like Contoso Ltd., AI automatically suggests the account name, primary contact, territory, and currency based on previous opportunities and account history. This feature eliminates manual lookup time and prevents data entry errors.

- **Creating related records:** When you add a new contact for a company already in your system, AI suggests the parent account, office location, and other company-specific details, ensuring data consistency across all related records.

### Smart paste (preview) scenarios

Transform unstructured information from emails, websites, and documents into structured CRM data, saving time and improving data capture accuracy.

- **Email-to-lead conversion:** You receive an inquiry email saying "Hi, I'm John Smith from Fabrikam Corp. We're looking for a CRM solution. You can reach me at john.smith@fabrikam.com or 555-123-4567." Copy this text and use smart paste in a new lead form to let AI extract and populate the relevant fields such as name, company, email, and phone number.

- **Web research data entry:** When you're researching a prospect's website, you copy the "About Us" or "Contact" page content. Use smart paste to automatically fill in fields in the lead or account form with company name, industry, location, and contact details.

- **LinkedIn profile information:** After viewing a prospect's LinkedIn profile, you can copy their experience section. Smart paste intelligently extracts current job title, company name, and work history to populate contact and account fields, ensuring up-to-date professional information.
### Files (preview) scenarios

Eliminate manual transcription from physical documents and reduce errors when digitizing business information from various file formats.

- **Trade show lead capture:** After collecting dozens of business cards at a trade show, you can quickly upload photos of business cards to create contact records. AI extracts names, job titles, company names, phone numbers, and email addresses, turning hours of manual data entry into minutes of review and confirmation.

- **Document-based lead generation:** When prospects send company brochures or proposal documents, AI can extract key business information like company details, decision-maker names, and contact information to create comprehensive lead records without manual typing.
