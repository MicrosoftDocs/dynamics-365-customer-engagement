# Recalculate an opportunity in Dynamics 365 Sales

When you add a product to an opportunity, the opportunity's estimated revenue value is calculated based on the price, discounts, taxes, and other pricing modifications for the product.

To change the estimated revenue value of an opportunity based on any changes to the associated products or product quantities, recalculate the opportunity.
