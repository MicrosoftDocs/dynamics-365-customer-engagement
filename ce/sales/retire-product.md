# Retire products  

If your organization doesn't sell a product, bundle, or family anymore, retire it so that the product record is no longer available to your sales agents. 

> [!NOTE]
> Product families are only supported for Sales Enterprise and Sales Premium. 

## Retire a product

1. Depending on the sales app that you're using, do one of the following:
 
    -  If you're using the Sales Hub app, 
        1. Select **Change area** ![Icon to change the work area.](media/change-area-icon.png "Icon to change the work area") at the lower-left corner of the site map, and then select **App Settings**. 
        1. In the **Product Catalog** area, select **Families and products**. 
   - If you're using the Sales Professional app,
       - Select **Products** from the site map.  
  
3. Open an active product, bundle, or family that you want to retire, and on the command bar, select **Retire**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Retired product families cannot be reactivated. Unparent a product before retiring if you think you may need to reactivate it later.  

4. In the **Confirm Retire** dialog box, select **Confirm**.

## Reactivate a retired product

If you have retired a product inadvertently or want to restore a product that was retired earlier, open the product and select **Activate**.  

You can only reactivate a standalone product. If a product has a parent, you'll not see the **Activate** option. You cannot reactivate a product family either.
