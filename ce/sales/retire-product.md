        1. Select **Change area** ![Icon to change the work area.](media/change-area-icon.png "Icon to change the work area") at the lower-left corner of the site map, and then select **App Settings**. 
        1. In the **Product Catalog** area, select **Families and products**. 
   - If you're using the Sales Professional app,

## Reactivate a retired product

If you have retired a product inadvertently or want to restore a product that was retired earlier, open the product and select **Activate**.  

You can only reactivate a standalone product. If a product has a parent, you'll not see the **Activate** option. You cannot reactivate a product family either.
