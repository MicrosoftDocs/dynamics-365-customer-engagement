# Understand the sequence stats page

The stats about sequences provide insights on the performance of a sequence, such as success rate and the state of records that are connected. The data helps you view the sequences that are doing better and emerging with high conversion rates.

## Understand the sequence stats page

The **Sequence stats** page consists of information on data related to each sequence that's available in your organization and the timeframe for which you want to view the data.

### Select the timeframe  

Select the timeframe for which you want to view the data. When you've made your selection, the table is refreshed to show data for that timeframe. By default, the timeframe is selected as 30 days, but  you can choose from the following timeframes:

-	30 days
-	90 days
-	180 days
-	1 year
-	2 years

>[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
>![Choose a timeframe to view data.](media/sa-sequence-stats-page-choose-time.png "Choose a timeframe to view data")

For example, if you want to view the data for the last 90 days, select **Last 90 days** from the date dropdown list. The table will be refreshed to show data for the last 90 days.

### Sequence stats list

The sequence stats list consists of sequences—including inactive ones—that are available in your organization, for all record types. For the timeframe you selected, you can view information such as success rate.   

The **Success Rate** column displays the trend of the sequence with its successful conversion rate for the connected records in the selected timeframe. 

>[!NOTE]
>The **Success Rate** column is available only for lead and opportunity record types.  

>[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
>![The Success rate column.](media/sa-sequence-stats-page-column-success-rate.png "The success rate column")  
 
The trend shows how a sequence is performing in the selected timeframe compared to that of the previous timeframe. For example, if you select 30 days and a sequence related to the lead record type shows an upward trend (green), this shows that the sequence has performed better in converting leads into opportunities in the current 30 days when compared to the previous 30 days. Green indicates improvement, red indicates a downward trend, and orange indicates that there has been no change in the success rate.

The percentage shows the average number of records that are successfully converted into win deals or opportunities when compared to the previous timeframe.
