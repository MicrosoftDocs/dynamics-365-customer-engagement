## Enable or disable the enhanced experience

Depending on the Dynamics 365 Sales license you have, select one of the following tabs for specific information: 

# [Sales Premium and Sales Enterprise](#tab/SE)

If you have the Sales Hub app, follow the instructions in this tab. Otherwise, follow the instructions in the **Sales Professional** tab to configure the option in Power Platform.

1. In lower-left corner of the screen, select **Change area** ![Icon to change the work area.](media/change-area-icon.png "Icon to change the work area"), and then select **App Settings**.

2. Under **Product Catalog**, select **Product Catalog Settings**.

3. On the **Product catalog settings** page, turn on **Enhanced experience for adding products** to enable the enhanced experience. 
    When you enable the enhanced experience, you'll see additional options for customizing the **Add products** dialog box.

     You can either add more columns to the grid or add more attributes to the **Product** column in the dialog box. For more information, see [Customize the Add Products dialog box](customize-add-products-dialog-box.md).
    
    If you turn off the enhanced experience, the **Add products** option in the opportunity, quote, order, and invoice will switch back to **Quick create** form.

# [Sales Professional](#tab/SP)

If you're using a custom app or Sales Professional app, you can enable or disable the enhanced experience from **System Settings** in Power Platform.

1. In your app, select **Settings** ![Settings.](media/settings-icon.png "Settings"), and then select **Advanced Settings**.

   ![Advanced Settings link in the site map.](media/advanced-settings-option.png)

   The **Business Management settings** page opens in a new browser tab.
   > [!NOTE]
   > The **Advanced Settings** page is moving from the web client to an Unified Interface app. If your organization has enabled the public preview of the **Advanced settings redirection** feature, you’ll see the settings open in the Power Platform Environment Settings app. Find more information about the app and navigation path in [Advanced settings in the new experience](advanced-settings-new-experience.md).

2. On the navigation bar, select **Settings**, and then select **Administration**.

3. Select **System Settings**.

4. In the **System Settings** dialog box, go to the **Sales** tab and set **Adding products** to **Yes** to enable the enhanced experience. Set it to **No** to disable. 

5. Select **OK**.
