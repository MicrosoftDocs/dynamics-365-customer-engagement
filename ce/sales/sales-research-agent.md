# Sales research agent in Dynamics 365 Sales

As a sales leader, you need to make data-driven decisions to drive your business forward. However, it's not always easy to get the insights you need. You might spend hours gathering data from different sources and still not have a clear picture of what's happening in your business. The sales research agent in Dynamics 365 Sales can help you get the insights you need quickly and easily.

With the sales research agent in Dynamics 365 Sales, you can use natural language to start a dialog with your data or pick from AI-suggested topics. This dialog helps you gain deep understanding of the sales performance of your team, territory, and product portfolio.

## How the agent works

The research agent is directly to your Dynamics 365 Sales data source. When you ask a research question, the agent creates a research plan. It then gathers, analyzes, and transforms your data into meaningful research outputs. These outputs are tailored to your context, business domain knowledge, and deep understanding of the business data, and are delivered to you as comprehensive, AI-generated research blueprints.

## How to use the agent

Use the agent to:

- Create multi-branch research journeys over your Dynamics 365 Sales data and augment it with any data from local files (Excel, PDF) for a comprehensive view of your business.  

- Use AI-suggested, prebuilt topics that are optimized for your role to get started or ask your own questions using natural language to seek insights into complex business problems.  
- Use the AI cursor to click anywhere on the canvas to start a conversation, zoom into any research finding, change a visualization, or add more data.  
- See the reasoning behind the research outcomes.  
- Save your workspaces for later use, update with new data, and regenerate blueprints or new research findings.
