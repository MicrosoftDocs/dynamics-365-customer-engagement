## Enable editable Products grid

Currently, the preconfigured Products grid is available only on apps built on the Unified Interface framework and is optimized to work on the web.

The product editable grid is added out-of-the-box to the **Product Line Items** section of the Opportunity form of type **Main**. For Quote, Order, or Invoice, it is added to the Products section of the forms of type **Main**. 

If you’re upgrading to the latest version and you’ve made customizations to the **Product Line Items** or **Products** sections of these forms, your customizations will prevail, and the product editable grid won’t be added to the forms by default. You must manually enable the product editable grid, though the product grid configurations for the editable grid already will be defined. If there are no customizations to these sections, the Products grid will be automatically configured and enabled after the upgrade. 

To enable the editable products grid on the Opportunity, Quote, Order, or Invoice form:

1. In your app, select the **Settings** icon, and then select **Advanced Settings**.

   > The **Advanced Settings** page is moving from the web client to an Unified Interface app. If your organization has enabled the public preview of the **Advanced settings redirection** feature, you’ll see the settings open in the Power Platform Environment Settings app. Find more information about the app and navigation path in [Advanced settings in the new experience](advanced-settings-new-experience.md).

2. On the navigation bar, select **Settings** and then under **Customization**, select **Customizations**.

2. Select **Customize the System** to open the default solution.
