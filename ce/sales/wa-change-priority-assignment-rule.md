# Prioritize assignment rules

When assignment rules run, a lead or an opportunity might meet the criteria of multiple rules. To determine which rule should take precedence, you can set their priority. A record that matches more than one rule is assigned by the rule that has a higher priority.

## Change the priority of an assignment rule

1. Sign in to your Sales Hub app.

1. In the lower-left corner of the page, select **Change area** > **Sales Insights settings**.

1. Under **Sales accelerator**, select **Work assignment**.

1. Select a **Record type** to view the segments of that type.

1. Open a segment that has at least two assignment rules, and then select the **Assignment rules** tab.

1. Change the priority of the rules using either of these methods:

    - Hover your pointer over a rule and use the drag handle (**&vellip;&vellip;**) to drag the rule up or down in the list. The change is saved automatically.
    - Select a rule, select **Change rule priority**, type the new priority number, and then select **Save**.
