## Change or remove the parent of a product

When you change the parent of a product, inherited properties from the previous parent are removed from the record and its child records. For example, think of a TV that was previously classified as "Plasma." The organization decides to organize TVs as Smart and Non-Smart TVs. They decide to move it from the "Plasma" family to the "Smart TV" family. A new set of properties relating to Smart TV are added and Plasma properties are removed from the parent. 

**To change or remove the parent of a product**

1. Open the record for which you want to change parent.
1. In the **Parent** field, select an appropriate product family.

2. To remove the parent from the record, just remove the parent record from the **Parent** field.

**Things to consider when reparenting a record:**

-	Products which are re-parented can't be reverted. When a product is reparented, the properties inherited from the previous parent are lost. Thus, you can't revert the properties of the reparented product to the last active version of the product. 

- You can only select a product family as a parent.
- You can only set product families that are in the Under Revision, Draft, or Active state as a parent.
-	You can only change or remove the parent from records that are in the **Under Revision** or **Draft** status.
-	For an **Under Revision** record, only an **Under Revision** or **Active** record can be selected as its parent.
-	For a **Draft** record, only an **Under Revision**, **Draft**, or **Active** record can be selected as its parent.
