# Manage hierarchies

As an administrator, you can manage hierarchies to ensure they're up-to-date and relevant for users. You can edit, delete, or unpublish hierarchies as needed.  

## Edit a hierarchy

To edit a hierarchy, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your sales app, and in the lower-left corner of the page, go to **Change area** > **App Settings**.  
1. Under **General Settings**, select **Visual hierarchy**.  
    A list of existing hierarchies is displayed.  
1. Select the hierarchy you want to edit.
1. Make the necessary changes to the settings. To know the settings you can change, see [Configure the root node of the hierarchy](create-activate-hierarchy-visualizations.md#configure-the-root-node-of-the-hierarchy) and [Configure the child node](create-activate-hierarchy-visualizations.md#configure-the-child-node).  
1. Select **Save** to apply your changes.  
    The updated hierarchy is now available for users.  

## Delete or unpublish a hierarchy

If a hierarchy is no longer needed, you can delete or unpublish it.

Follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your sales app, and in the lower-left corner of the page, go to **Change area** > **App Settings**.  
1. Under **General Settings**, select **Visual hierarchy**.  
    A list of existing hierarchies is displayed.  
1. Select the hierarchy you want to delete or unpublish.
1. To delete the hierarchy, select **Delete** and on the confirmation message, select **Delete**.
    The hierarchy is permanently deleted from your organization.  
1. To unpublish the hierarchy, select **Unpublish** and on the confirmation message, select **OK**.
    The hierarchy is unpublished and no longer available to users. You can republish it later if needed by selecting **Publish**.
