# Set up branding and theming

You can create a custom look and feel (a theme), for your app by making changes to the default colors and visual elements provided in your system. For example, you can create your personal product branding by adding a company logo and providing table-specific coloring. The theme colors are applied globally throughout the application.

## Apply a theme

The Dynamics 365 Sales app comes with three default themes that you can use. You can choose one of these default themes and apply it, or pick a custom theme that you have created.

**To apply a theme**:

1. In the site map, select **Sales settings**.

2. Under **Advanced settings**, select **Branding and theming**.

3. In the **Select Theme** list, select a theme. 

4. Select **Save**.

  The theme name currently being used is suffixed with the text "- Currently applied".

## Create a new theme

**To create a new theme**:

1.  In the site map, select **Sales settings**.

2.  Under **Advanced settings**, select **Branding and theming**.

3.  Select **Create new theme**.

4.  In the **Theme Name** field, enter a descriptive name for the new theme.

5.  To change the logo, select the pencil icon on the logo box, and then choose an image file of type JPG, PNG, GIF, or SVG format. The image file is converted to a web resource. 

    To revert to the default logo, select **Restore default logo**.

6.  Enter a tooltip for the logo.

7.  Choose colors in the **Nav Bar Color**, **Main Color**, and **Accent Color** boxes.

8.  Select **Save**.

  The theme name currently being used is suffixed with the text "- Currently applied".
