# Enable duplicate lead detection for custom forms

The duplicate lead detection feature in Dynamics 365 Sales helps detect duplicate leads. By default, this feature is enabled for the main lead form in the Sales Hub app. However, if you've customized the main lead form, you must manually enable duplicate lead detection.

> [!NOTE]
> This customization can be applied only to main forms of the `Lead` table in the custom app.
