# Edit assignment rules

To modify your process for automatically assigning leads, opportunities, or insights to sellers, you can update the conditions that you've defined in the rule.

[!INCLUDE [sales-work-assignment](../includes/sales-work-assignment.md)]

## Edit an assignment rule

1. Sign in to your Dynamics 365 Sales Hub app.

1. In the lower-left corner of the page, select **Change area** > **Sales Insights settings**.

1. Under **Sales accelerator**, select **Work assignment**.

1. Select a **Record type** to view segments of that type.

1. Open a segment, and then select the **Assignment rules** tab. Or, to go directly to the **Assignment rules** tab, select the link in the **Assignment rules** column.

1. Select the rule, and then select **View and edit**. Or, open the rule.

1. Change what you need to, and then select **Save**.

Your changes are applied to records that are connected to the segment going forward. Any records that were previously connected to the segment aren't affected.
