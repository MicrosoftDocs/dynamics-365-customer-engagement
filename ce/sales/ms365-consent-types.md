# Microsoft 365 consent types

Your Microsoft 365 admin needs to provide consent to let Dynamics 365 collect, store, and use Microsoft 365 data. This article describes the different consent types required by Dynamics 365 to generate insights. For more information about the insights generated by Dynamics 365 Sales, see [Insights generated from Microsoft 365 data](insights-from-m365.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365 each have their own service-specific licensing terms. The service-specific terms that apply depend on which service processes your data. For example, when a copy of your Microsoft 365 data is transferred to Dynamics 365, your Microsoft 365 data in that copy becomes Dynamics 365 data and the Dynamics 365 service-specific terms apply.

The following table lists the consent types and the list of Dynamics 365 applications that use the shared Microsoft 365 data. The list of applications is subject to change.

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on the Dynamics 365 application that you use and the insights you need, you can request the Microsoft 365 admin to provide the appropriate consent. More information: [Provide consent to collect data from Microsoft 365](provide-consent-office365.md)
