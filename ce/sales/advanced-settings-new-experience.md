# Advanced settings in the new experience

The new experience for advanced settings in Dynamics 365 Sales provides a modern, intuitive, and responsive interface that makes it easier to configure and manage your organization's settings. The new experience uses the Unified Interface and replaces the legacy web client experience. Learn more about the new settings experience in [Use the Power Platform Environment Settings app](/power-platform/admin/environment-settings-app).

## Enable or disable the new experience

The new experience is turned on by default. To go back to the legacy web client experience, [turn off the new experience setting](/power-platform/admin/environment-settings-app?tabs=new#turn-off-the-power-platform-environment-settings-app) in the Power Platform admin center.

### Similarities and differences

- Entities are referred to as Tables.
- Customizations are done in Power Apps.
- Navigation paths are similar in most cases, but there are some minor changes as shown in the table below.
