# Delete or deactivate segments

Sometimes, you might want to get rid of segments that are no longer relevant or useful for your sales team's activities. You have two options to do this in Dynamics 365 Sales Hub:

- **Deactivate a segment** to keep it in the app but stop it from connecting to any new records. The records that were already connected to the segment remain connected. You can reactivate the segment later if you need it again.
- **Delete a segment** to remove it from the app completely. The records that were already connected to the segment in a sequence aren't affected. You can't undo this action.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Default segment** cannot be **Deleted** or **Deactivated**.

## Deactivate or delete a segment

1. Sign in to your Dynamics 365 Sales Hub app.

1. In the lower-left corner of the page, select **Change area** > **Sales Insights settings**.

1. Under **Sales accelerator**, select **Work assignment**.

1. Select a **Record type** to view the segments of that type.

1. Hover over the segment and select **More options** (**&vellip;**).

    - To keep the segment but make it inactive, select **Deactivate segment**.

    - To remove the segment entirely, select **Delete**.

1. Confirm the action when you're prompted to do so.
