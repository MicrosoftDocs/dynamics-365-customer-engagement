# Manage opportunities

An opportunity refers to sales deal, which is created when a lead is ready to buy. With an opportunity, you can forecast sales revenue, set a potential close date, and factor in a probability for the sale to occur.

## Work with opportunities

To manage opportunities efficiently, administrators can define the seller experiences, define the predictive scoring rules, and so on. Sellers can create opportunities, use predictive scores to improve the opportunity conversion, and win more deals.

The following table lists the tasks that each role performs to manage opportunities.
