# Manage sequences 

Sequences help sales managers enforce best practices by introducing a set of consecutive activities for sellers to follow during the course of their day. A manager can connect sequences to leads and opportunities that appear in a seller's work queue, to help sellers prioritize activities to focus on selling, be more productive, and better align to business processes.
