# Customize the lead qualification experience  

As an admin, you can customize the lead qualification experience to help sellers qualify leads more effectively.

## License and role requirements

| Requirement type | You must have |
|:-----------------|:--------------|
| **License** | Dynamics 365 Sales Premium, Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise, or Dynamics 365 Sales Professional <br>More information: [Dynamics 365 Sales pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/) |
| **Security roles** | System Administrator <br> More information: [Predefined security roles for Sales](security-roles-for-sales.md)|

## Difference between new lead qualification experience and legacy experience

The new lead qualification experience is the default experience in the Sales Hub app. [What if I had previously defined the lead qualification experience?](faq-lead.md#what-if-i-had-previously-defined-the-lead-qualification-experience).

The new experience lets you customize the following aspects:

- Select who creates opportunities when leads are qualified&mdash;seller or automatically by the system.
- Allow sellers to create multiple opportunities when a lead is qualified.
- Modify the opportunity form that opens when a lead is qualified.
- Choose to let Copilot summarize the lead after a lead is qualified.

The legacy experience only lets you choose whether to automatically create account, contact, and opportunity records when a lead is qualified.

## How to customize the lead qualification experience

1. In the Sales Hub app, select the Change area icon :::image type="icon" source="media/change-area-icon.png" border="false"::: at the bottom of the site map, and then select **App Settings**.

2. Under **General Settings**, select **Lead + Opportunity management** > **Lead Qualification**.

   You'll see the following options:

    - **Try the new lead qualification experience**: This setting is turned on by default. This setting lets you define the following experiences:
        - [Define the record creation experience for each record type](#define-the-record-creation-experience-for-each-record-type)
        - [Customize opportunity creation experience for qualified leads](#customize-opportunity-creation-experience-for-qualified-leads)
        - [Enable lead summarization](#summarize-the-lead-after-its-qualified)
    
      :::image type="content" source="media/lead-qualify-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Lead qualification settings page.":::

      Turn it off to use the legacy experience.

    - **Auto-create records for newly qualified leads**: This option enables the legacy experience. Turn this setting on to automatically create account, contact, and opportunity records when a lead is qualified.
    
    If you turn off both the options, sellers are prompted to choose the records they want to create for the lead.

    For information about the fields that are mapped from the lead to other entities when records are created automatically, see [Field mappings to other entities](#field-mappings-to-other-entities).

### Define the record creation experience for each record type

With the new [Lead qualification experience](#how-to-customize-the-lead-qualification-experience), you can define who creates the record&mdash;seller or automatic&mdash;when a lead is qualified.  

- Select **Seller** if you want sellers to decide whether to create a record, use an existing record, or not create a record at all.

- Select **Automatic** if you want the system to create the record automatically. Sellers can review the records that will be created automatically.

In either case, if there's a matching record in the system, the duplicate detection rules are applied to prevent the creation of duplicate records. Sellers can choose to use the existing record or create a new one. For more information about rules used to identify duplicates, see [Manage duplicate leads](manage-duplicate-leads.md).
 
### Customize opportunity creation experience for qualified leads

The following options are available only when you select **Seller** for Opportunity creation in the [new Lead qualification experience](#how-to-customize-the-lead-qualification-experience):

- Under **Modify opportunity form**, select **Add or remove fields** to customize the opportunity form that opens when a lead is qualified. The Quick create form opens in Power Apps for editing. You can add or remove fields, change the order of fields, or change the properties of fields. For more information, see [Add, move, configure, or delete columns on a form](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/add-move-or-delete-fields-on-form).

- Select **Let seller create up to 5 opportunities from a newly qualified lead** to allow sellers to create multiple opportunities when a lead is qualified. This option is useful when a lead is associated with multiple deals. Sellers can create up to five opportunities from a lead. 

  > [!NOTE]
  > If your sellers are using a custom app, add the **Opportunity qualify lead Form** component to the app. Otherwise, sellers can neither edit the default opportunity nor create new opportunities in the **Qualify lead** side pane.
 
### Summarize the lead after it's qualified

With the [new Lead qualification experience](#how-to-customize-the-lead-qualification-experience), you can choose to let Copilot summarize the lead after it's qualified. Select the checkbox under the **Lead qualification details** section. 

> [!NOTE]
> Copilot must be [enabled for your organization](enable-setup-copilot.md) to use this feature. 

When this option is selected, Copilot summarizes the lead by extracting key information from the lead and creating a summary card. The summary card includes key information such as the lead's name, company name, email, phone number, and address, along with links to the account, contact, and opportunity records that were created. 
 
## Define the experience using legacy web client

If you aren't using the Sales Hub app, you can define the lead qualification experience by using the legacy web client. However, you can only configure the legacy experience using the web client. The new lead qualification experience is available only in the Sales Hub app.

1. In your app, select the **Settings** icon, and then select **Advanced Settings**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/advanced-settings-option.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Advanced Settings option on the Settings menu":::

   The **Business Management** page opens.
2. Select **Settings** > **Administration** > **System Settings**.
3. Select the **Sales** tab.
4. Under **Qualify lead experience**, set **Create Account, Contact, and Opportunity records by default upon qualifying a lead** to **Yes** to automatically create account, contact, and opportunity records when a lead is qualified. Set it to **No** to allow salespeople to choose which records to create when a lead is qualified. 

## Field mappings to other entities

When a lead is qualified, values of some fields from leads are automatically mapped to the corresponding fields in accounts, contacts, and opportunities. To know why you can't delete out-of-the-box field mappings and apply custom field mappings for lead qualification, see [this FAQ](faq-lead.md#lead-qualification-custom-field-mappings).
