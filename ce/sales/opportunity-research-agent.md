# Opportunity Research Agent overview

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

The Opportunity Research Agent in Dynamics 365 Sales helps sales professionals move deals forward by providing most critical insights at every stage of the opportunity. It aggregates information from CRM records, email conversations, and real-time web research into a single view. This view provides sellers with vital account context, buyer needs and pain points, overall deal health, stakeholder engagement signals, competitor activity, and emerging risks. When a risk is detected, the agent provides a clear, targeted mitigation recommendation—so sellers can address issues promptly, keep momentum high, and close more opportunities faster.

**Opportunity catchup:** Sellers can ramp up quickly with opportunity summaries, including deal size, target close date, customer pain points, and recent updates.

**Stakeholder intelligence:** The agent tracks stakeholder changes in real time, classifies roles (such as economic buyer or champion), and flags new decision-makers or influencers&mdash;helping sellers build relationships with the right people.

**Competitor highlights:** Competitor mentions are detected from emails, meetings, and CRM entries, with timely alerts and tailored strategies based on past deal history.

**Actionable risk mitigation:** The agent surfaces actionable risk signals, such as stalled momentum or loss of key stakeholders, and recommends mitigation steps to keep deals moving forward.
