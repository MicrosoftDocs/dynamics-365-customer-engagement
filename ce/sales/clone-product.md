## Clone a product

When you're creating a new product, family or bundle, save time by cloning an existing one. Cloning creates a copy of the original record with all the details except for the name and ID. If the product, bundle, or family has any properties, they're also copied to the cloned record.  

> [!NOTE]
> Product families are only supported for Sales Enterprise and Sales Premium.  

**To clone a product, family, or bundle:**

1. Depending on the sales app that you're using, do one of the following:
 
    -  If you're using the Sales Hub app, 
        1. Select **Change area** ![Icon to change the work area.](media/change-area-icon.png "Icon to change the work area") at the lower-left corner of the site map, and then select **App Settings**. 
        1. In the **Product Catalog** area, select **Families and products**. 
   - If you're using the Sales Professional app,
       - Select **Products** from the site map.  
  
3. Select or open a product family, product, or bundle record that you want to clone, and on the command bar, select **Clone**.

    :::image type="Confirm cloning of product" source="media/confirm-clone-product.png" alt-text="Confirm cloning of product":::

4. Select **Confirm**.
    
    A new product record will open with the same details as the original one except for the name and ID.  
  
    The new record is created under the same parent node as the original one.
