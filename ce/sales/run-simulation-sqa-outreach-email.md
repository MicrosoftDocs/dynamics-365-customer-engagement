# Run simulation to review outreach email content

This feature is available only in **Research and engage** (fully autonomous) mode.  
You can run a simulation to review the drafts of outreach emails generated by the Sales Qualification Agent. This helps you ensure that the emails are customized and relevant to the leads before they are sent out.  

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Simulation consumes tokens from your Copilot capacity. Ensure you have enough tokens available in your Copilot capacity to run the simulation. Learn more in [Manage Copilot Studio messages and capacity](/power-platform/admin/manage-copilot-studio-messages-capacity?tabs=new).

After you complete the configuration of the Sales Qualification Agent, do the following:

1. Go to the **Simulation** section and then select **Outreach emails**.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Outreach emails** option is enabled only if you have leads that match the configured selection criteria and all the agent configurations are completed and marked with a green checkmark.

1. In the **Review outreach emails** page, select **Start testing**. The agent performs the following actions:  
    1. Research the assigned leads.  
    1. Draft outreach emails based on the research.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > If testing of outreach emails fails due to unknown reasons, contact Microsoft support.

1. After the research is complete, the drafts are available for review, select **Review**.  
1. Review the drafts and provide feedback or make edits as necessary.
