# Forecast with multiple data type columns

In a forecast grid, you can have multiple columns with different data types&mdash;such as currency and quantity&mdash;displayed in a single view. For example, in a product-based forecast, you can display the **Best case** column values as a quantity (the decimal value of the volume of products sold) and as currency simultaneously.

For more information about configuring columns and data types, go to [Choose layout and columns](choose-layout-and-columns-forecast.md).

## License and role requirements
| Requirement type | You must have |
|-----------------------|---------|
| **License** | Dynamics 365 Sales Premium or Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise  <br>More information: [Dynamics 365 Sales pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/) |
| **Security roles** | System Administrator or Forecast Manager <br> More information: [Predefined security roles for Sales](security-roles-for-sales.md)|

While the forecast grid can display multiple data types, the Kanban view can only display a single data type at a time. Hence, for a multiple data type forecast, you must select the primary data type to be displayed in these views before activating the forecast.

Similarly, the Kanban view can't show two columns with the same selector. For example, using the **Best case** selector both revenue and discount. As the Kanban view can only show a single revenue column for a category, you must choose the revenue column to display in these views before activating the forecast.  

## Examples of forecasts with different data types

Let's look at a few examples of configuring and activating forecasts with different data types:

- [Example 1: Create two different currency columns and a quantity column with the same forecast category](#same-fc-different-data-type-currency-qty)

- [Example 2: Create a currency column and a quantity column with two different forecast categories,](#different-fc-different-data-type)

<a name=same-fc-different-data-type-currency-qty></a>
**Example 1: Create two different currency columns and a quantity column with the same forecast category**

Let's say you want to view the **Best case** forecast category's total amount, discount amount, and the number of products sold to get this amount. You configure three **Best case** columns as follows in the **Layout** step of the forecast:

| Column name | Type | Selector | Data type | Amount field |
|-------------|--------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Best case** | Rollup | Best case| Currency | Amount |
| **Best case discount** | Rollup | Best case| Currency | Manual Discount or Volume Discount |
| **Best case products sold** | Rollup | Best case| Decimal | Quantity |

After you've completed the other configuration steps as required and are activating the forecast, an error message is displayed at the top of the **Activate forecast** configuration page. 

:::image type="content" source="media/forecast-publish-multiple-data-type-error.png" alt-text="Multiple data type error":::

Select **Fix issue**. The following **Layout warnings** pane is displayed, where you can select a primary data type.

:::image type="content" source="media/forecast-publish-layout-warnings-pane.png" alt-text="new image":::

- If you select the primary data type as **Quantity**, the forecast chooses the **Best case products sold** column to display in the Kanban view. This is because the **Best case products sold** column is the only column that has a quantity (in this case, decimal) data type. You can proceed with activating the forecast after you select the primary data type. The Kanban view in the following image displays only one lane with a single quantity-based column.

    :::image type="content" source="media/forecast-primary-datat-quanity-bestcase.png" alt-text="Example of the primary data type selected as quantity":::
    
- If you select the primary data type as **Currency**, you must choose between **Best case** and **Best case discount** columns to display in the Kanban view. This is because both these columns have **Currency** as the data type and share the same selector (**Best case**). Select the appropriate column, and then select **Save**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/forecast-data-type-select-currency-choose-column.png" alt-text="Select the primary data type as currency and choose a column":::

    In this forecast, the **Best case** column is selected to be displayed in the Kanban view, though the **Best case discount** column is of the same selector and data type. The quantity-type column **Best case products sold** is of the same selector and is displayed in the forecast grid, but not in the Kanban view.

    :::image type="content" source="media/forecast-primary-data-currency-bestcase.png" alt-text="Example of selecting the primary data type as currency":::

<a name=different-fc-different-data-type></a>
**Example 2: Create a currency column and a quantity column with two different forecast categories**

Let's say you want to view the total revenue of the **Won** forecast category and the products sold under the **Best case** forecast category. You configure the **Won** and **Best case** columns as follows in the **Layout** step of the forecast:

| Column name | Type | Selector | Data type | Amount field |
|-------------|---------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Won** | Rollup | Won | Currency | Amount |
| **Best case products sold** |  Rollup |  Best case| Decimal | Quantity |

After you've completed the other configuration steps as required and are activating the forecast, the "Kanban can't show columns with multiple data types. Please resolve this issue to activate the forecast" error message is displayed at the top of the **Activate forecast** configuration page.

Select **Fix issue**, and in the **Layout warnings** pane, select a primary data type.

Select the primary data type that meets your needs. As the **Won** (currency) and **Best case** (quantity) columns have different selectors and data types, you must select one of them a primary data type to be displayed in the Kanban view.

## View selected primary data type and columns

You can view the details of the primary data type and the selected column (among duplicate columns with the same selector) that'll be displayed in the Kanban view. The displayed details are view-only and can't be edited after you activate the forecast.

1. Sign in to the **Sales Hub** app.

2. In the site map, select the **Change area** ![Icon to change the work area.](media/change-area-icon.png "Icon to change the work area"), and then select **App Settings**. 

3. Under **Performance management**, select **Forecast configuration**.

    The forecast configuration page opens. 

4. Select **More options** corresponding to the forecast, and then select **Edit**.

5. Go to the **Layout** configuration step. At the bottom of the **Layout** section, a **Layout warnings** section is displayed. 

6. Select **View settings**. A **Layout warnings** pane is displayed on the right side of the page.

    :::image type="content" source="media/forecast-view-settings-layout-warnings-pane.png" alt-text="Select view settings and view layout warnings pane":::

    You can view the selected primary data type and column to display in the Kanban view.
