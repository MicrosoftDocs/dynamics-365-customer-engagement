# Enable duplicate lead detection 

Enable duplicate lead detection to help your sellers identify and address potential duplicate leads.

## License and role requirements
| Requirement type | You must have |  
|-----------------------|---------|

## What is duplicate detection?

>[!VIDEO https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=94602225-e5b4-4070-abc8-3ada754da622]

The duplicate detection capability helps sellers to check for potential duplicate leads in the app. When you enable this capability, the AI model uses the following rules to identify duplicates:

- Same email address  
- Same phone number  
- Similar lead name and company name  
- Similar lead name and the same email domain  

Further, sellers can compare and remove the duplicate leads in the organization. More information: [Manage duplicate leads](manage-duplicate-leads.md)

>[!NOTE]
>- If the Microsoft Power Platform duplicate detection feature is enabled in your organization, a message is displayed as shown in the following image:

## Trouble in identifying duplicate leads?

If the duplicate detection feature isn't working, do the following steps:  

1. Turn off the feature.
1. Ensure that the following requirements are met:
    - [Enable Dataverse search](#enable-the-dataverse-search)
    - [Enable the required fields for leads](#enable-the-required-fields-for-leads)
    - [Activate the required processes](#activate-the-required-processes)
    - [Provide read permissions for process](#provide-read-permissions-for-process)
1. Turn on the feature.

### Enable the Dataverse search

Dataverse search is enabled in your organization. The AI model that detects duplicate leads uses Dataverse search for better results. More information: [Configure Dataverse search for your environment](/power-platform/admin/configure-relevance-search-organization)   
 
### Enable the required fields for leads  

The following fields are enabled in the **Quick Find All Leads** view for leads, under the **Find by** section: 
- `firstname`
- `lastname`
- `emailaddress1`
- `telephone1`
- `companyname`  

>[!NOTE]
>If these fields are already enabled, remove and add them back.

To go to the **Quick Find All Leads** view, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).

1. On the **Views** page, select the **Quick Find All Leads** view.

To go to the **Processes** page, follow these steps:     

1. In the web app, go to **Settings** > **Advanced Settings**.
