# Add the lead scoring widget to a form

By default, the predictive lead scoring widget is available only in the out-of-the-box **Sales Insights** form. If you're using a customized form for leads, you can add the predictive lead scoring widget to it.

> [!IMPORTANT]

> - You can add a lead scoring widget to a form only in Unified Interface apps.
> - You can't use the legacy form designer to add a lead scoring widget to a form.
