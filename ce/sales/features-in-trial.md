## Sales accelerator

The sales accelerator in Dynamics 365 helps you to:

- Prioritize your customer list quickly by using an intelligent work list. The work list helps you reach out to the next best lead or opportunity by displaying relevant sales information and customer context.
- Define sequences for different scenarios that your sales team is likely to encounter. Scenarios help sales teams to be consistent because they know the steps they need to take to move the deal forward.
- Create rules to automatically assign leads and opportunities to your sellers.
