# View a sequence in a grid

As an administrator, you can create a saved query to view the latest sequences that are in progress in an entity record grid.

## License and role requirements
| Requirement type | You must have |  
|-----------------------|---------|
| **License** | Dynamics 365 Sales Premium or Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise <br>More information: [Dynamics 365 Sales pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/) |
| **Security roles** | System Administrator <br>  More information: [Predefined security roles for Sales](security-roles-for-sales.md)|


## Create a saved query

1.	Make sure that you have the System Administrator security role or an equivalent role. To check your security role, do the following:

    1.	Follow the steps in [View your user profile](/powerapps/user/view-your-user-profile?context=/dynamics365/context/sales-context).   
    2.	Don't have the correct permissions? Contact your system administrator.   

2.	(Optional) Create a new view for each entity that you want to include in the sequence view. The entity must be enabled for the sales accelerator on the **Workspace** setup page. For more information, go to [Manage access and record type](manage-access-record-type-sales-accelerator.md).  

4.	Create a solution with the name **SequenceViewSolution**. For more information, go to [Create a solution](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/add-app-solution?context=/dynamics365/context/sales-context).  

5.	Select **Entities** > **Add Existing** > **Entity**, and then find and add the entities for which you created views (as described in step 2).   

6.	Select **Save and Close**.   

7.	Publish all customizations.   

8.	Select the **SequenceViewSolution** solution you created in step 4.

9.	Export the solution, and choose the **Package type** as **Unmanaged**. The ```SequenceViewSolution.zip``` file will be downloaded.

10.	Delete the solution that was created during step 4 from the organization.

11.	Extract the exported solution zip file (the file you downloaded in step 9).

12.	In the solution contents folder, locate and then open ```Solution.xml```. 

13.	Change the following value in ```Solution.xml```, and then save it:  

    Change ```<Managed>0</Managed>``` to ```<Managed>1</Managed>```.

14.	In the solution contents folder, locate and open ```customization.xml```.

15.	For each view that you added in step 2, locate its ```<savedquery>``` and add the following to its ```fetchxml``` function:

    ```xml
    <link-entity name="msdyn_sequencetarget" from="msdyn_target" to="{primary key of the entity}" alias="sequencetarget" link-type="outer">
        <attribute name="msdyn_parentsequence" />
        <filter type="and">
            <condition attribute="statecode" operator="eq" value="0" />
        </filter>
    </link-entity>
    ```

    For example, if the view was added for the lead entity, replace the ```to``` parameter in ``link-entity`` with ```leadid```.

16.	For each view that you added in step 2, locate its ```<savedquery>``` and add the following to its ```layoutxml```.

    ```xml
    <cell name="sequencetarget.msdyn_parentsequence" width="100" />
    ```    

17.	Save the file.

18.	Zip the folder.

19.	Open a model-driven app, such as Sales Hub in Dynamics 365.

20.	Go to **Settings** > **Solutions**.

21.	Import the solution (the zipped file you created in step 18).

22.	Publish all customizations.
