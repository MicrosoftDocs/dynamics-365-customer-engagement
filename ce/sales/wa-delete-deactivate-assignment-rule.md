# Delete or deactivate assignment rules

Sometimes, you might want to get rid of assignment rules that are no longer relevant or useful for your sales team's activities. You have two options to do this in Dynamics 365 Sales Hub:

- **Deactivate a rule** to keep it in the app but stop it from assigning any new records. The records that were already assigned remain assigned. You can reactivate the rule later if you need it again.
- **Delete a rule** to remove it from the app completely. The records that were already assigned aren't affected. You can't undo this action.

## Deactivate or delete an assignment rule

1. In the lower-left corner of the page, select **Change area** > **Sales Insights settings**.

1. Under **Sales accelerator**, select **Work assignment**.

1. Select a **Record type** to view the segments of that type.

1. Open the segment that contains the assignment rule, and then select the **Assignment rules** tab.
