# Select a forecasting template

Select a template to define how a forecast structures your organization's data and projections. If you prefer to create a forecast based on your own rollup and hierarchy entities, select **Create from scratch** instead.

## License and role requirements
| Requirement type | You must have |
|-----------------------|---------|
| **License** | Dynamics 365 Sales Premium or Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise<br>More information: [Dynamics 365 Sales pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/) |
| **Security roles** | System Administrator<br>More information: [Predefined security roles for Sales](security-roles-for-sales.md)|

## Select a template  

The fastest way to create a forecast is to use a template. The template that you select defines how the forecast groups data.

On the **Forecast configurations** page, select one of the following templates:

- **Org chart forecast**: Rollup columns and projections are based on your organization's reporting structure. This template uses the **Manager** field of the **User** entity for the hierarchy.
- **Product forecast**: Rollup columns and projections are based on the product hierarchy.
- **Territory forecast**: Rollup columns and projections are based on the sales territory hierarchy.
