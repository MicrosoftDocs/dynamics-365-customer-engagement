# Assign a sequence to a user or a team

Before users or teams can use a sequence you create, you need to assign them to it. Assigning users and teams to a sequence gives them full permissions to view, edit, and delete the sequence.

## Assign a sequence

1. Sign in to the **Sales Hub** app. In the lower-left corner of the page, go to **Change area** > **Sales Insights settings**.

1. Under **Sales accelerator**, select **Sequences**.

1. Select one or more sequences, and then select **Assign**.

1. In the **Assign Sequence** box, enter the following information:

    | Parameter | Description |
    |-----------|-------------|
    | Assign to | Select **User or team** to choose a user other than yourself or a team to assign to the sequence. Select **Me** to assign only yourself. |
    | User or team | Type the name of a user or a team. To assign the sequence to multiple users, [create a team](manage-teams.md?tabs=sales) with the users as the members and then assign the sequence to the team. |
