# Turn on preview features for Copilot in Dynamics 365 Sales

Instead of turning on Copilot preview features in Dynamics 365 Sales individually, you can turn them all on at once. This article describes how to do that, and lists the Copilot preview features that are available.

## Copilot preview features

Preview features aren't intended for production use and might have limited functionality. These features are made available to get early feedback from customers.

Typically, you turn on Dynamics 365 preview features individually in [Power Platform](/power-platform/admin/what-are-preview-features-how-do-i-enable-them). To make it easier, we added an option that turns on all the Copilot preview features in Dynamics 365 Sales with a single selection.

The following table lists the Copilot preview features that are available in Dynamics 365 Sales.

| Preview feature | Description |
|-----------------------|---------|
| Copilot for Email | [Compose and send email messages using Copilot](compose-send-email-copilot.md). |
| Answers from SharePoint documents | [Get answers from SharePoint documents (preview)](copilot-ask-questions.md#get-answers-from-sharepoint-documents) <br> The answers are fetched only from the documents stored in the SharePoint site associated with your tenant. |
| Content recommendations | [Get content recommendations from SharePoint](copilot-get-information.md#get-content-recommendations-from-sharepoint-preview) to fetch documents from the SharePoint site that's associated with your tenant. |
| Immersive view | [Open Copilot in full-screen view (preview)](use-sales-copilot.md#open-copilot-immersive).|
