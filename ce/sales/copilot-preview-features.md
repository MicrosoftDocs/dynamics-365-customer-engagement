# Turn on preview features for Copilot in Dynamics 365 Sales

Instead of turning on Copilot preview features in Dynamics 365 Sales individually, you can turn them all on at once. This article describes how to do that, and lists the Copilot preview features that are available.

## Copilot preview features

Preview features aren't intended for production use and might have limited functionality. These features are made available to get early feedback from customers.

Typically, you turn on Dynamics 365 preview features individually in [Power Platform](/power-platform/admin/what-are-preview-features-how-do-i-enable-them). To make it easier, we added an option that turns on all the Copilot preview features in Dynamics 365 Sales with a single selection.

The following table lists the Copilot preview features that are available in Dynamics 365 Sales.

| Preview feature | Description |
|-----------------------|---------|
| Full-screen, immersive view | [Open Copilot in full-screen view (preview)](use-sales-copilot.md#open-copilot-immersive) when you want more space and focus to chat with Copilot and ask questions. |
| Account summarization | [Summarize an account in your organization](copilot-get-information.md#summarize-an-account) |
