# Delete a family, product, or bundle (Sales Hub) 

To stop selling a product, bundle, or family, delete it. If you delete a parent family, its child products, families, and bundles are also deleted.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  You can't restore a deleted product record. If you don't want to delete a product record but want to temporarily remove it from the catalog, then [retire the product record](retire-product.md).

## Delete a product record

1. Depending on the sales app that you're using, do one of the following:
 
    -  If you're using the Sales Hub app, 
        1. Select **Change area** ![Icon to change the work area.](media/change-area-icon.png "Icon to change the work area") at the lower-left corner of the site map, and then select **App Settings**. 
        1. In the **Product Catalog** area, select **Families and products**. 
   - If you're using the Sales Professional app,
       - Select **Products** from the site map.  
  
3. Select or open a product family, product, or bundle record you want to delete, and on the command bar, select **Delete**.
