# Goal management tables

The *goal management* in Dynamics 365 Sales lets you set sales, marketing, and other business goals for your organization and measure the results against the targets. The goal management will help you motivate your work force, identify successful programs, do better planning, and grow your business.  
  
 Goal management offers the following capabilities:  
  
-   Create a complex goal hierarchy where each goal is assigned to an individual goal contributor or a team.  
  
-   Use the goals in the hierarchy to track important business data, such as revenues, customer services cases, or phone calls. You can also track data represented by custom tables.  
  
-   Roll up the totals for each goal, such as total revenues or units shipped, in the hierarchy tree.  
-   Measure the results of the rollup against the targets or stretch targets.  
-   Track the goal results for a fiscal period or a custom period.  
-   Align the goal period with the current fiscal year settings.  
-   Support different goal types, such as Amount or Count.  
-   Track actual, in-progress, and custom data.  
-   Add complex queries to refine the results of the rollup.  
-   Override the results of the rollup to include new or additional data.  
-   Incorporate goal results in reports, charts, and dashboards.  
-   Support workflows and customizations.
