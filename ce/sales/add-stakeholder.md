# Add stakeholders, sales team, and competitors for the opportunity

When you're working on an opportunity, you'll be interacting with several people, both internally and externally. These people are broadly categorized as stakeholders, sales team, and competitors. Capturing information about the people that you're working with on the opportunity helps your leadership team understand how the opportunity is shaping up and where you need help.  

## License and role requirements
| Requirement type | You must have |
|-----------------------|---------|
| **License** | Dynamics 365 Sales Premium, Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise, or Sales Professional  <br>More information: [Dynamics 365 Sales pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/) |

## Add stakeholders and decision makers for the opportunity

A stakeholder can be a decision maker or any person who's working with you on the opportunity from the customer's end, such as a champion, end user, economic buyer, influencer, or technical buyer.

**To add stakeholders:**

1. In the Sales Hub site map, select **Opportunities**.

1. Open the opportunity.

1. In the **Summary** tab, go to the **Stakeholders** section.
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you'd selected a person in the **Contact** field of the opportunity, that contact is automatically added to the **Stakeholders** section.
    
1. Select **More commands for Connection** and then Select **New Connection**.

1. In the **Lookup Records** pane, browse and select a **Contact**, and then select **Add**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **New Connection** button is supported only for the out-of-box Stakeholders and Sales Team views on the Opportunity entity. If you're using custom views, the **New Connection** button doesn't appear on the sub-grid. In such cases, navigate to the Connection Associated view for the record and use the **Connect** button to create a new connection. More information: [How are stakeholders and sales team members tracked for opportunities?](stakeholders-sales-team-members.md)

    The selected contact is added as a stakeholder. 
1. To convert a stakeholder to any other stakeholder category (for example, decision maker), select the stakeholder record and then select **Edit**.
1. In the **As this role** field, remove Stakeholder and select a role that best fits the contact. For example, select Decision Maker if the contact is a decision maker for the opportunity.  
1. Go back to the opportunity and verify that the stakeholder's role is updated.
