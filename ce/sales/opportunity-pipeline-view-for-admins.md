## Set the pipeline view as the default opportunities view

The **Read-only Grid view** is the default view for opportunities. You can set the **Opportunities pipeline view** as the default instead, so sellers don't have to switch to it each time they access their opportunities list.

1. In your sales app, select **Settings** > **Advanced Settings**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The **Advanced Settings** page is moving from the web client to an Unified Interface app. If your organization has enabled the public preview of the **Advanced settings redirection** feature, youâ€™ll see the settings open in the Power Platform Environment Settings app. Find more information about the app and navigation path in [Advanced settings in the new experience](advanced-settings-new-experience.md).

1. In the **Settings** menu, select **Customizations** > **Customize the system**.
1. From the Power Apps Default Solution page, select **Entities** > **Opportunity**.
1. Select the **Controls** tab, and then select **Pipeline view** for web, phone, and tablet. If you don't see **Pipeline view** in the **Control** list, select **Add Control**, then select **Pipeline view**, and then select **Add**.  

   :::image type="content" source="media/pipeline-set-as-default.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Controls tab with the Pipeline view set as the default for web, phone, and tablet." lightbox="media/pipeline-set-as-default.png":::

1. (Optional) In the **Properties** section, scroll down and set the **Enable grouping** and **Enable aggregation** properties to **Yes**. These settings allow sellers to group and aggregate opportunities in the pipeline view. To know about the seller experience, see [Group and aggregate opportunities](use-opportunity-pipeline-view.md#group-and-aggregate-opportunities).

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you've [enabled monthly channel](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/channel-overview) or [opted in for early access](/power-platform/admin/opt-in-early-access-updates) updates, you need not change these properties as they're enabled by default.


1. Save the changes and select **Publish**.
1. From the Sales Hub sitemap, select **Opportunities** to verify that the pipeline view is set as the default view.

## Open the opportunity pipeline view settings page

Open the settings page to configure and customize the opportunity pipeline view experience for your sellers. You'll be accessing the settings page in all the procedures explained in this article.

Do one of the following depending on your license:

- If you have the Sales Enterprise or Sales Premium license, select **App Settings** from the Sales Hub Change area and then select **Opportunity pipeline view** under **General Settings**. 

- If you have the Sales Professional license, append the following URL after the base URL of your Sales Professional app: `&pagetype=control&controlName=MscrmControls.Sales.DealManagerSettings.DealManagerSettings`. Example: `https://contoso.crm.dynamics.com/main.aspx?appid=00001111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333cccc4444&pagetype=control&controlName=MscrmControls.Sales.DealManagerSettings.DealManagerSettings`.

### Permissions required for opportunity pipeline view

Permissions to access the pipeline view and the settings page are controlled by the **dealmanagersettings** and **dealmanageraccess** entities. The permissions are granted to the following security roles by default:

- The read privileges to dealmanagersettings and dealmanageraccess entity is granted to all security roles which are customizable on publish or on first load from the opportunity pipeline view settings page.

- The sales-related security roles such as salesperson, sales manager, and vice president of sales get the read privileges to dealmanagersettings and dealmanageraccess entities by default.

## Set the default form for side panel

When sellers open an opportunity from the pipeline view, the side panel displays the opportunity details in the Sales Insights form. You can change the default form to the main opportunity form or a custom form for your organization. For example, you can create a custom form specifically for the side panel and set that as default. Sellers can switch to a different form if they prefer and their selection will be remembered and set as a default for them.  

1. [Open the opportunity pipeline view settings page](#open-the-opportunity-pipeline-view-settings-page).
1. In the **Set the default form for side panel** section, select the form that you want to set as the default for your organization.


## Set the default metrics for sellers

The opportunity pipeline view lists important metrics related to the sales pipeline at the top of the view. You can customize this space to view metrics that you want sellers to track. Sellers will see these metrics by default; they can [personalize them](personalize-pipeline-view.md#personalize-metrics) if required.

1. [Open the opportunity pipeline view settings page](#open-the-opportunity-pipeline-view-settings-page).
1. In the **Set default metrics for sellers** section, select **Edit metrics**.

   Create, update, remove, or delete a metric in the **Edit metrics** side panel.

    - To create a metric:
 
       1. Select **Create a Metric**.

        1. Select the field and the aggregate function that you want to use for calculating the metric.
           The **Field** list displays all the numerical fields in the opportunity entity.
        1. (Optional) Add filters to calculate metrics from specific records. For example, if you want to view the estimated revenue of all opportunities created this year and are in the **Develop** stage, create a metric with the following values:
            - **Field:** Est. Revenue
            - **Aggregate function:** Sum
            - **Filters**
                - **Created On**: This year  
                - **Sales Stage**: Develop  
    
    - To edit a metric, hover over the metric in the **Edit metrics** side panel, and select the **Edit** icon.
    - To remove a metric temporarily, clear the checkbox against the metric in **Edit metrics** side panel.
    
## Customize charts

The charts in the pipeline view help sellers visualize their pipeline better. You can customize various elements in the bubble chart, such as the data on the x-axis and y-axis, the size and color of the bubble, the sort order for the legend, and tooltips. Similarly, you can customize elements in the funnel chart, such as the field used for segmentation, the aggregate function used, and so on.  

### Customize the bubble chart

1. [Open the opportunity pipeline view settings page](#open-the-opportunity-pipeline-view-settings-page).

1. In the **Manage charts** section, edit **Deal tracker**. 
   > [!NOTE]
   > You can turn off the corresponding **Status** toggle to hide the bubble chart.
1. Customize the following elements:
    - **Horizontal (x) axis**  
      Select any field of type `DateTime`. For example, you can plot the chart based on the delivered date instead of the closed date.  
    - **Vertical (y) axis**  
      Select any numerical field.
    - **Segment by**  
        Select what the color codes signify. For example, select **Pipeline Phase** to color-code the bubbles based on which phase an opportunity is in.
    - **Size**  
        Select a numerical field to indicate the size of the bubble.
    - **Sort legend**  
        Select how to sort the chart legend. Legends indicate the color used for each segment. For example, if you select **Opportunity grade** as the segment, the legends will be sorted based on the chronological order of the grades.
    - **Tooltips**  
        Select the details that you want users to see displayed as tooltips when they hover over a bubble.  

1. Save the changes and select **Publish**.
1. [Open the opportunity pipeline view](use-opportunity-pipeline-view.md#open-the-opportunity-pipeline-view) to verify the changes.

### Customize the funnel chart

1. [Open the opportunity pipeline view settings page](#open-the-opportunity-pipeline-view-settings-page).
1. In the **Manage charts** section, edit **Sales funnel**.
   > [!NOTE]
   > You can turn off the corresponding **Status** toggle to hide the funnel chart.

    The following screenshot illustrates the parts of the funnel chart that you can customize:

    :::image type="content" source="media/funnel-chart-customization.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the funnel chart and its elements that can be customized." lightbox="media/funnel-chart-customization.png":::

1. Customize the following elements:
    - **Segment by**  
      Select the field for segmenting the funnel chart. **Default:** Pipeline phase  
    - **Values**  
      Select the field for sizing the bars in the funnel. **Default:** Est. revenue  
    - **Aggregation**  
        Select the aggregate function to use for the **Values** field. This field determines the height of the bar. The aggregate value is displayed when you hover over a segment in the funnel chart.
    - **Sort legend**  
        Specify how to sort the segments. For example, selecting Finish to start for a funnel chart segmented by pipeline phase will display the funnel from the last phase to first phase, that is from Close to Qualify.

1. Save the changes and select **Publish**.
1. [Open the opportunity pipeline view](use-opportunity-pipeline-view.md#open-the-opportunity-pipeline-view) to verify the changes.

## Customize the editable grid

The grid in the opportunity pipeline view is an instance of the Power Apps editable grid control. The grid can be both customized and personalized. As an administrator, you can [customize the grid](/power-apps/developer/component-framework/customize-editable-grid-control) for the entire sales organization. Sellers can [personalize their view](personalize-pipeline-view.md) to include the columns and filters they want to see.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you customized the editable grid in the deal manager using JavaScript, you need to redo those customizations in the pipeline view. To customize the editable grid, see the [Power Apps documentation](/power-apps/developer/component-framework/customize-editable-grid-control). For information on grid events, see [Events in forms and grids in model-driven apps](/power-apps/developer/model-driven-apps/clientapi/events-forms-grids).
