# Define and schedule a forecast model

Use general properties and scheduling options to define and schedule a forecast model.

## License and role requirements

## Define a forecast model

Define the entities that must be used to generate the forecast. 

1. In the **General** step of the **Forecast configuration** page, define the fields that should be used for the forecast. The following screenshot is an example of the **General** step for an org chart forecast. Let's walk through the options in the subsequent steps.

    :::image type="content" source="media/forecast-general-tab-configuration-section.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the General step of the Forecast configuration page, with the General options shown." lightbox="media/forecast-general-tab-configuration-section.png":::

1. Enter a descriptive name for the forecast. Example: *Kenny's Org FY2023 Forecast*.

1. Select a **Rollup entity**.

    The forecast is based on the gross rollup of the entity you select. Each forecast template starts with a default rollup entity:

    | Template | Default rollup entity |
    |----------|-----------------------|
    | Org chart forecast | Opportunity |
    | Product forecast | Opportunity Product |
    | Territory forecast | Opportunity |

    Choose a custom or out-of-the-box entity to support your organization's specific requirements if needed.

    Only entities that have **Change Tracking** turned on are listed. To learn more, see [Enable change tracking to control data synchronization](/power-platform/admin/enable-change-tracking-control-data-synchronization).


1. Select the **Funnel** icon next to **Rollup entity** to filter opportunities that participate in calculating the forecast values. [Learn more about roll up filters](add-additional-filters.md#add-additional-filters-on-opportunities-to-calculate-forecast-values).

1. Select a **Hierarchy entity**.

    The forecast uses this entity to group your organization's data. Only entities that have a hierarchy are shown in the list.

    Each forecast template starts with a default hierarchy entity:

    | Template | Default hierarchy entity |
    |----------|--------------------------|
    | Org chart forecast | User |
    | Product forecast | Product |
    | Territory forecast | Territory |

1. Select the **Funnel** icon next to **Hierarchy entity** to filter your forecast to include only those hierarchies that meet the specified conditions. [Learn more about hierarchy filters](add-additional-filters.md#filter-hierarchy-records-in-the-forecast).

1. Select a **Rollup to hierarchy relationship**.

    This step establishes a relationship between the rollup and hierarchy entities. Each forecast template starts with a default rollup to hierarchy relationship:

    | Template | Rollup to hierarchy relationship | Description |
    |----------|----------------------------------|-------------|
    | Org chart forecast | Opportunity > Owner (User) > User | The forecast hierarchy is defined based on the organizational hierarchy. |
    | Product forecast | Opportunity Product > Existing Product (Product) > Product | The forecast hierarchy is defined based on the product hierarchy. |
    | Territory forecast | Opportunity > Account (Account) > Territory (Territory) > Territory | The forecast hierarchy is defined based on the territory hierarchy. |

    Choose different values to support your organization's specific requirements if needed.

    In the example screenshot, we selected **User** as the hierarchy entity. We can choose from fields in the **Opportunity** entity that are related to the **User** entity. As we want to build a forecast based on sellers who own opportunities, we selected **Owner** as the relationship. The relationship is mapped as *Opportunity > Owner (User) > User*. The mapping specifies that the forecast values are based on the **Owner** field in the **Opportunity** entity.
 
    What if there is no direct relationship between the rollup entity and the hierarchy entity? In that case, you can choose a field from a related entity to define an indirect relationship. Select the **Related** tab, and then choose a field from the list. Only fields in hierarchical entities are shown in the **Related** list.

    In the following example, we selected **Opportunity** as the rollup entity and **Territory** as the hierarchy entity. Because there's no direct relationship between them, we must select the **Related** tab.

    In our example, the **Territory** field in the **Related** list is indirectly related to **Opportunity** through the **Account** entity. In other words, **Account** is an intermediate entity for establishing a relationship between **Opportunity** and **Territory**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/forecast-relationship-entity-related-attribute-account-user.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the General step of the Forecast configuration page, with the related field selected.":::

    The relationship is mapped as *Opportunity > Account (Account) > Territory (Territory) > Territory*. The mapping specifies that there's a field **Account** in the **Opportunity** entity that's related to the **Account** entity. The **Account** entity in turn has a **Territory** field that's related to the **Territory** entity. The rollup values in the forecast are based on the relationship defined through the **Territory** field.

1. In the **Top of hierarchy** list, select a value that will be at the top of this forecast hierarchy.

    The list of values depends on the hierarchy entity you selected. For example, if you select **User** as the hierarchy entity, the list displays active users in your organization.

    Let's say that Kenny Smith, a sales director, wants to see the forecast for their team. Kenny builds a forecast based on the **Org chart** template and selects their own name as the top of the hierarchy. The team's hierarchy is previewed to the right of the forecast options.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/forecast-general-tab-configuration-section.svg" alt-text="A screenshot of the General step of the Forecast configuration page, with a preview of the selected hierarchy shown.":::

1. [Schedule the forecast](#schedule-the-forecast), as described in the following section. You must add at least one forecast period to go to the next step.

1. When you've finished scheduling, select **Next**.

## Schedule the forecast

In the **Scheduling** section, add forecast periods to match the forecast periods in your organization and how often you want to generate the forecast. Each forecast configuration can have multiple forecast periods with different period types.

### Quick example

Let's say your organization's fiscal year runs from January 1 to December 31. To schedule a monthly forecast for the fiscal year 2023, select the values as follows:

- **Scheduling format**: **Gregorian**
- **Period start date**: **Jan 1, 2023**
- **Forecast period**: **Monthly**
- **Fiscal year**: **FY2023**
- **Start this forecast**: **January**
- **Number of periods**: **12**

When you add the above schedule, 12 forecast periods are added to the **Periods for this forecast** table on the right side. Select the image to see the full screen view. For information about each of the above fields, see [Manage forecast periods](manage-forecast-periods.md).
