# Sales Close Agent overview (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

The Sales Close Agent is an AI-powered solution designed to autonomously manage the entire sales cycle for high-velocity and low-complexity deals. Unlike the Sales Qualification Agent, which focuses on lead research and handoffs, Sales Close Agent goes beyond qualification to actively engage customers, recommend products, handle objections, and drive transactions toward closure. It uses templated personalization for outreach and follow-ups, ensuring timely engagement with existing customers who may not have received dedicated seller attention. This makes it ideal for scenarios like SMB deals where allocating human sellers increases costs to the organization and not practical.  
The agent relies on a well-defined product catalog in Dynamics 365, accurate pricing, and URLs to ensure compliance and precision in customer interactions. It also leverages knowledge sources and customizable agent playbooks to align with an organization’s sales strategies and messaging. While the current capability focuses on guiding customers to self-service checkout, future enhancements will include advanced features like quote generation and discount handling. By combining automation with flexibility, the agent empowers businesses to scale sales operations efficiently while maintaining control over compliance and customer experience.
