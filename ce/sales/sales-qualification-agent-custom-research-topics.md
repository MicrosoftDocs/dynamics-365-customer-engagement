# Define custom research insights for Sales Qualification Agent

By default, the company research insights generated by the Sales Qualification Agent cover key areas such as company overview, financials, and recent news. However, you can enhance the agent's research capabilities by adding custom research insights tailored to your sales team's specific needs. 

For example, you can configure the agent to provide insights about recent conversations with the lead, key stakeholders and decision makers, past spends based on internal billing data,or any other relevant information that can help your sellers better understand and engage with leads. Learn more in the [Example scenarios](#example-scenarios) section.

## Add custom research insights and knowledge sources to Sales Qualification Agent

1. [Go to the agent settings page](open-sales-qualification-agent-settings.md).  

1. Under **Knowledge**, select **Research**, and then scroll down to the **Create custom research** section.
1. Select **Create custom research** and enter the following details:
   - **Display name**: Enter a name for the custom research insight. This name is used as a title for the research insights generated by the agent and shown on the Lead research page.
 
   - **What insight you want the seller to see**: Describe the type of insight you want the agent to generate for this insight. This instruction acts as a prompt for the agent to generate relevant research insights. For example, "Summarize the lead company's past purchase history from our internal billing system."
   - **Preferred knowledge source**:  Only one knowledge source or MCP tool can be selected per custom research insight. Review the [Best practices for adding custom research insights](#best-practices-for-adding-custom-research-insights) section and then perform *ONE* of the following steps:

       - Select an existing knowledge source. The agent lists the knowledge sources and MCP tools configured in the **D365 Sales Agent - Custom Research** agent in Copilot Studio. 

       - Add a new knowledge source or MCP tool.  
           - Select **Add in Copilot Studio** from the drop-down. This action opens the **D365 Sales Agent - Custom Research** agent in Copilot Studio. 

           - Select **Add knowledge** to add a Public URL, Sharepoint document, Azure Data Lake, and Dataverse table as the knowledge source. To add an MCP tool or connector to non-Microsoft sources, select the **Tools** tab and then select **Add a tool.** 
           - Return to the Sales Qualification Agent settings page and select the newly added source from the drop-down.

        :::image type="content" source="media/custom-research-topic.png" alt-text="Screenshot of adding a custom research insight in Sales Qualification Agent settings.":::  
        If you don't select any knowledge source, the agent relies on its own knowledge, public data, and other sources you configured.
1. Select **Add** to create the custom research insight.
1. Select the **Test** icon (:::image type="icon" source="media/test-icon.png" border="false":::) in the **Custom research** section. 
1. Follow the instructions in the **Test insight** pane and verify whether the agent is generating relevant research insights using the knowledge sources you added.
   If the response isn't satisfactory, refine the prompt in the **What insight do you want the seller to see** field and retest. 
1. After the test is successful, open the **D365 Sales Agent - Custom Research** agent in Copilot Studio and select **Publish**.
1. Return to the Sales Qualification Agent settings page and save the changes and start the agent.
   The agent will generate the custom account research insights for new leads and [leads that meet the reprocessing criteria](sales-qualification-agent-faq.md#trigger-events). Sellers can view these insights under the Deeper insights section of the [Lead research page](use-sales-qualification-agent.md#lead-research-page) in Dynamics 365 Sales.

## Best practices for adding custom research insights

When adding the custom research insights to Sales Qualification Agent, consider the following best practices to ensure high-quality and relevant insights for your sellers:

- Start with a single, high-value internal data source to validate quality before scaling.
- Use precise and consistent naming conventions for each insight (for example, QBR Summary, Competitor Comparison, Partner Risk Assessment).
- Avoid overloading the agent with multiple or loosely relevant data sources as this can reduce output accuracy.
- Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of each custom insight based on seller feedback and usage telemetry.
- When you use a non-public knowledge source or an MCP tool, ensure that sellers have the necessary access permissions to these sources so that they can open the citation links and cross-verify the insights if needed.

## Example scenarios

This section provides example scenarios illustrating the types of custom research insights you can add to Sales Qualification Agent using different knowledge sources and MCP tools.

### Example: Custom insights about recent conversations and engagements

Let's say that your sellers want to get the context of any recent conversations, calls, and meetings that took place between the lead's company and people from your company. And imagine your sales organization uses Gong for its powerful revenue insights. You can use the Gong's Microsoft Graph connector to synthesize those insights as part of Sales Qualification Agent's research using the following steps: 

1. Link Gong to your Microsoft 365 graph connector using the Microsoft 365 admin center. Learn more in [Gong Copilot connector](/microsoftsearch/gong-connector). While setting up the connector, keep the following points in mind: 
    - Ensure that you have sufficient access in the Gong app to view the access key.
    - Ensure that your Dynamics 365 Sales environment is in the same Microsoft 365 tenant where you set up the Gong graph connector.
    - Select **Custom setup** and set the User permissions to **Everyone** so that your sellers get the complete context of ongoing conversations, otherwise they'll only have access to conversations they directly had in the past with the lead’s company.

    After Gong successfully starts syncing with Microsoft Graph, you'll be able to see the Gong connector as an available knowledge source in Copilot Studio.
   :::image type="content" source="media/gong-connector-in-copilot-studio.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Gong connector as an available knowledge source in Copilot Studio.":::
   
1. Follow the steps in [Add custom research insights and knowledge sources to Sales Qualification Agent](#add-custom-research-insights-and-knowledge-sources-to-sales-qualification-agent) section to add Gong as a knowledge source, test it, and publish the agent.
    :::image type="content" source="media/gong-as-preferred-source.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Gong selected as the preferred knowledge source for custom research insight in Sales Qualification Agent settings.":::  
  When the Sales Qualification Agent researches a lead, it provides insights about recent calls as shown in the following screenshot:
  :::image type="content" source="media/research-insights-with-gong.png" alt-text="Screenshot of research insights generated by Sales Qualification Agent using Gong as a knowledge source."::: 

### Example: Custom insights about stakeholder and decision-making process

You are setting custom research insights for your company Contoso Inc that produces and sells GPUs to other companies. To effectively engage with your leads, your sellers need three additional insights:

**The key stakeholders and decision makers** – Who are the right stakeholders and decision makers for the company?
**The company’s 2025 AI roadmap** – Where is the company in their AI adoption roadmap? Are they running any AI workloads?
**The company’s tooling posture** - Summarize the recent service case history for the company.

Let's see how your sellers can get additional insights about key stakeholders and decision makers in the lead's company. In this example, we'll be using a connector to a non-Microsoft data source that provides firmographic and technographic data about companies called 'Enlyft.'

1. Create a new custom research insight in the Sales Qualification Agent settings page.

1. Add the following details:
   -  **Title:** Key stakeholders and decision makers

   -  **Insights you want the seller to see:** Who are the key decision makers and stakeholders for the company?
   - **Preferred knowledge source:** Select **Add in Copilot Studio** from the drop-down and select the Enlyft connector tool that you already configured in the **D365 Sales Agent - Custom Research** agent in Copilot Studio.
     :::image type="content" source="media/custom-research-topic-add-tool.png" alt-text="Screenshot of adding Enlyft tool as the preferred knowledge source in Copilot Studio.":::
1. Test the custom research insight and publish the agent.
   When the Sales Qualification Agent researches a lead, it provides insights about key stakeholders and decision makers in the lead's company.

Similarly, you can create additional custom research insights for the company's AI roadmap and tooling posture by adding relevant prompts and knowledge sources in the Sales Qualification Agent settings page as shown in the following screenshot:

:::image type="content" source="media/multiple-custom-insights-example.png" alt-text="Screenshot of multiple custom research insights added in Sales Qualification Agent settings.":::

### Other example scenarios

For custom research, you can leverage available knowledge sources and connectors/Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers&mdash;including those from leading technology vendors in the CRM domain. Set up your custom knowledge sources and tools in Copilot Studio, add them to the **D365 Sales Agent – Custom Research** agent, and then link them to Sales Qualification Agent to generate tailored research insights for your sellers.

Some examples of what you can include:

- You can get more context about the company from briefing notes that your sales team has uploaded onto a Sharepoint site.
- You can summarize orders, service cases, and any other tables from Microsoft Dataverse.
- You can use a host of available knowledge sources in Microsoft Copilot Studio.
- You can get a wide range of company insights from leading data providers such as Enlyft and Draup using their connectors (available through the **Tools** menu in Copilot Studio). For example:
    - Get company tech stack (Draup)

    - Get IT spend by category (Draup)
    - Get key stakeholders or business objectives (Enlyft)
    - Get account plan overview (Enlyft)
 
- You can get insights from any applications or systems of record you use by adding your connector, prompt, or MCP Server into Copilot Studio. Learn more in [Create and add a new tool at agent level](/microsoft-copilot-studio/advanced-plugin-actions#create-and-add-a-new-tool-at-agent-level).
