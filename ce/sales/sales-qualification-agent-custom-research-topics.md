# Add custom research topics and knowledge sources to Sales Qualification Agent

By default, the agent generates research insights on standard topics such as company overview, financials, recent news, and competitor analysis using CRM records and public data. However, your sellers might need additional insights about the lead's company, such as their past spend from your internal billing data, or financial reports sourced from a country/region-specific data source. You can configure the agent to generate research insights based on these custom topics by specifying the topics and uploading relevant knowledge sources.

1. [Go to the agent settings page](open-sales-qualification-agent-settings.md).  

1. Under **Knowledge**, select **Research**, and then scroll down to the **Create custom research** section.
1. Select **Create custom research** and enter the following details:
   - **Display name**: Enter a name for the custom research topic. This name is used as a title for the research insights generated by the agent and shown on the Lead insights page.
 
   - **What insight you want the seller to see**: Describe the type of insight you want the agent to generate for this topic. For example, "Summarize the lead company's past purchase history from our internal billing system."
   - **Preferred knowledge source**: Select a knowledge source that the agent should use to generate insights for this topic. The agent lists the knowledge sources and [MCP tools](connect-to-model-context-protocol-sales.md) configured in the D365 Sales Agent - Custom Research agent in Copilot Studio. You can add other knowledge resources or MCP tools to generate insights for custom research topics. If you don't select any knowledge sources, the agent relies on its own knowledge, public data, and other sources you've configured.
1. Return to the Sales Qualification Agent settings page and select the Test icon (:::image type="icon" source="media/test-icon.png" border="false":::) in the **Custom research** section. Follow the instructions in the **Test insight** pane and verify whether the agent is generating relevant research insights using the knowledge sources you added.
