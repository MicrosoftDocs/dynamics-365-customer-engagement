Copilot takes into account the [user's preferred UI language](/dynamics365/project-operations/environment/language-localization) and localizes responses based on that preference. Depending on the user's preferred UI language, org language, and languages supported for a specific Copilot feature, the responses are localized accordingly. The following table summarizes the expected behavior in different scenarios:

| Base language of the org | Preferred UI language of the user | Expected behavior                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| English                  | English                           | Output in English                                                                 |
| English or non-English   | One of the supported non-English languages | Output in the preferred UI language of the user.                                                |
| English or non-English   | An unsupported language     | Output is unpredictable as the language is unsupported. The responses are mixed with English and the user language. Use one of the supported Copilot languages. |

We're continuously working to expand the availability of Copilot features in more regions and languages. If you don't see your region or language listed in the report, check back later for updates.
