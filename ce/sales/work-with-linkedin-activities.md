## What are LinkedIn activities?

As a seller, you can use the LinkedIn network, which contains millions of users and offers a unique depth and quality of information you can use to research and connect with your customers. This functionality allows you to use LinkedIn Sales Navigator in your sequence to recommend the next best action.

When a sequence contains steps that are related to LinkedIn activities, you can do the following actions on the steps to interact with customers:

-	Research a customer to learn more about their preferences. More information: [Research activity](#research-activity)
-	Get introduced to a customer. More information: [Get introduced activity](#get-introduced-activity)
-	Send personal messages to connect with a customer. More information: [Connect activity](#connect-activity)
-	Send an InMail to customer. More information: [Send InMail activity](#send-inmail-activity)

## Research activity

The **Research** activity allows you to view LinkedIn profiles, including customer contact and account information, which can help you to better understand them before you start working with them.

You can do the actions as described in the following table:
