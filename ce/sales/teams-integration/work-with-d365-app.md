## Overview

With the Dynamics 365 app, you can view information about a linked record before the meeting, in the side panel during the meeting, and after the meeting.

> [!NOTE]
> The Dynamics 365 app for Teams is available only in the Teams desktop app. If you are working in Teams web client or Teams mobile app, the Dynamics 365 app will not be visible.

## View record details before or after a meeting

Open the meeting in Teams, and then select the **Dynamics 365** tab. You can work with the linked record as you would in your customer engagement apps, such as Dynamics 365 Sales or Dynamics 365 Customer Service.

## View record details during a meeting

Select the Dynamics 365 app icon in the meeting toolbar. Details about the linked record are displayed in a side panel. You can view and update information such as notes and tasks in the Contact, Opportunity, Lead, Account, and Case tables.
