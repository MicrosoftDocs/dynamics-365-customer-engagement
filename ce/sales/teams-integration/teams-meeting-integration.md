# Integrate Dynamics 365 and Microsoft Teams meetings (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

[!INCLUDE [preview-disclaimer](../../includes/preview-disclaimer.md)]

Microsoft Teams meeting integration allows you to stay in the flow of work, whether you're in Dynamics 365 or Teams:

- Create and join Teams meetings directly from Dynamics 365.
- View and update Dynamics 365 records seamlessly in a Teams meeting.
- Capture notes and tasks seamlessly during a Teams meeting. Your notes and tasks automatically sync to Dynamics 365.


## Meeting lifecycle

The lifecycle of a meeting can be divided into three stages, each with specific tasks.

- **Pre-meeting**:

  - [Create a Teams meeting](create-teams-meeting.md)
  - [Join a Teams meeting](work-with-d365-app.md)
  - [Add the Dynamics 365 app to a Teams meeting](add-d365-app.md)
  - [Use the Dynamics 365 app to view and update record information](work-with-d365-app.md#view-record-details-before-or-after-a-meeting)

- **In-meeting**

  - [Use the side-panel to view and update record information](work-with-d365-app.md#view-record-details-during-a-meeting)
  - [Work with notes during a meeting](work-with-notes.md)
  - [Work with tasks during a meeting](work-with-tasks.md)
  - [Work with activities during a meeting](work-with-activities.md)

- **Post-meeting**

  - [Use the Dynamics 365 app to view and update record information](work-with-d365-app.md#view-record-details-before-or-after-a-meeting)
