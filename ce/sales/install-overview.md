# Install Dynamics 365 Sales apps

Depending on your license, you can install the Sales Hub or Sales Professional app to get started with Dynamics 365 Sales immediately. If you've bought the team member licenses, use the Sales Team member app.  

## System requirements

Review the system requirements before installing Dynamics 365 Sales apps. [System requirements for Sales Hub and Sales Professional apps](system-requirements-for-sales-apps.md)

## Install and use the sales apps

Your Dynamics 365 Sales license comes with free apps that are either pre-installed or can be installed separately. To know about the apps available with your license, see [Dynamics 365 Sales licensing guide](dynamics-365-sales-licensing-guide.md).

The following table lists the apps and the installation instructions.  

|App name  |Install instructions  |
|---------|----------------------|
|Sales Hub app** (pre-installed with Dynamics 365 Sales Embedded Package)   | [Link](intro-saleshub.md)        |
|Sales Professional app     | [Link](provision-sales-professional-instance.md)        |
|Sales Team member app     | [Link](sales-team-member.md)         |

** The Sales Hub app installed from the Dynamics 365 Sales Embedded Package has the latest features and updates. The Sales App or Enterprise Edition Apps include legacy versions of the Sales Hub app. Even if they appear in your list of installed apps in Power Platform, the Sales Hub app installed with the Embedded Package takes precedence. In some environments, the legacy apps are hidden to avoid confusion.
