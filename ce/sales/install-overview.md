# Install Dynamics 365 Sales apps

Depending on your license, you can install the Sales Hub or Sales Professional app to get started with Dynamics 365 Sales immediately. If you've bought the team member licenses, use the Sales Team member app.  

## System requirements

Review the system requirements before installing Dynamics 365 Sales apps. [System requirements for Sales Hub and Sales Professional apps](system-requirements-for-sales-apps.md)

## Install and use the sales apps

Your Dynamics 365 Sales subscription comes with free apps that are either pre-installed or can be installed separately. The following table lists the apps and the license required to use them.  

|App name  |License required  |Install instructions  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Sales Hub app** (pre-installed with Dynamics 365 Sales Embedded Package)   |Sales Premium or Sales Enterprise         | [Link](intro-saleshub.md)        |
