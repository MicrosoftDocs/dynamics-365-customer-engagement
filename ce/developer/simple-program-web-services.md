# Run a simple program using Customer Engagement web services

[!INCLUDE[](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

This topic shows you how to compile and run a  program that creates an account record, retrieves the record, updates the record, and then prompts to see if you would like the record deleted.  

## Prerequisites

- Download the [Sample: Quick start for Microsoft Dynamics 365](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Sample-Quick-start-for-650dbcaa)
- You must be able to sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)] Customer Engagement.  
- [!INCLUDE [pn-visual-studio-short](../includes/pn-visual-studio-short.md)] 
- [!INCLUDE [pn-net-framework462-long](../includes/pn-net-framework462-long.md)]

### Compile and run the Quick Start sample

1. Extract the downloaded file and open the \C#\QuickStart.csproj
2. Open the \C#\QuickStart.csproj file in [!INCLUDE[pn-visual-studio-short](../includes/pn-visual-studio-short.md)].  
3. Right click the **QuickStart** project in the solution explorer and select **Manage NuGet Packages...*
4. Select the **Microsoft.CrmSdk.CoreAssemblies** package and update to the latest stable version.
5. Press **F5** to compile and run the program.  
6. Enter the following information at the prompts:

The default is 1, indicating the first organization in the list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

After the program runs, demonstrating create, retrieve, and update of an account record, you can delete the record that was created, or you can leave it so that you can view it in the application.                                                                                                                                                                               |

## Next Steps

After running the QuickStart program or most other SDK console-based samples, the server, organization, and user name information you entered when prompted is saved in an XML configuration file for re-use the next time you run a sample. This removes the need to enter that information again as you run additional samples. After the first time, the console prompts are as follows.


|                          Prompt                          |                                                                                                                                                         Description                                                                                                                                                         |
|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Specify the saved server configuration number (1-x) [x]: |                                                                Enter zero (0) to create a new server configuration and follow the prompts as shown in the table above. Otherwise, enter the number of a saved configuration as shown in the displayed list.                                                                 |
|                     Enter Password:                      |                                                                                Type your password. The characters will show as “\*” in the window. If your password has been saved from a previous sample run, you will not see this prompt.                                                                                |
|   Do you want these entity records deleted? (y/n) [y]    | Type **y** for yes and **n** for no. After the program runs, demonstrating create, retrieve and update of an account record, you can delete the record that was created, or you can leave it so that you can view it in the Web application or [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_full](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-full.md)]. |
|                   Press Enter to exit                    |                                                                                                                                              Press Enter to exit the program.                                                                                                                                               |

 If you would like to add or modify the functionality of this QuickStart program, you can modify the code in the CRUDOperations.cs file.  

 For more information about the helper code files that the QuickStart and many other SDK samples use, or to learn about how to set up a new project with the required assembly references, refer to [Use the Organization Service sample and helper code](org-service/use-sample-helper-code.md). For more information about the source code that handles saving and re-using the server configuration information, see [Helper Code: ServerConnection Class](org-service/helper-code-serverconnection-class.md).  

 A second sample project, named **QuickStart with Simplified Connection**, is included in the [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio](../includes/pn-visual-studio.md)] solution. This second sample shows a simplified method to connect to the [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] Organization service but is otherwise similar to the first QuickStart sample. This sample does not use any helper code to establish a web service connection.
