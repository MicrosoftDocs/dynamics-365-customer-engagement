# Campaign entities

[!INCLUDE[](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

A *campaign* in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] is designed to accomplish a specific result, such as introducing a new product or increasing market share. The main way to accomplish this result is through communicating the benefits of a product or service to people and businesses. Campaigns often include more than one communication method, such as print advertisements, promotional discounts, and direct mail. A campaign can be thought of as a container in which a business keeps planning tasks, campaign activities, and campaign responses. It has a list of related products, sales literature, and a set of marketing lists of existing or potential customers. This information is used to plan and track the results of a marketing campaign throughout its life.  
  
 Marketing automation supports campaign execution through *campaign activities* that are used to distribute emails, phone calls, and other activities to qualified customers. Each campaign activity may include a set of marketing lists of existing or potential customers. Bulk email may result in the responses from the customers that are captured in a *campaign response* record.  
  
 If you plan to distribute only one type of the activity, such as an email, use a *quick campaign*. The results of a quick campaign are captured in the quick campaign log.  
  
## Campaigns and Quick Campaigns  
 A campaign or a quick campaign can be used to accomplish the following:  
  
- Create campaign activities to communicate with a customer, such as sending an email, a letter, or making a telephone call.  
  
- Use marketing lists to distribute the campaign activities. Marketing lists are usually assembled based on certain criteria, such as customers that previously bought a particular product or used a particular service.  
  
- Analyze campaign responses to the campaign activities.  
  
  The following table compares campaigns and quick campaigns:  
  
|Feature|Campaign|Quick Campaign|  
|-------------|--------------|--------------------|  
|Campaign activities|A campaign may include different marketing activities. Some activities, such as tasks, are assigned to team members to perform specific tasks, for example, preparing a marketing list or printing sales literature. Other activities, such as emails, faxes, or letters are distributed through multiple campaign activities represented by the campaign activity entity (`CampaignActivity`). Each campaign activity is used to distribute one type of activity that specifies a recipient: phone call, appointment, letter, letter vial mail merge, fax, fax via mail merge, email, email via mail merge. The activities can be distributed over a period of time and at different times.|A quick campaign distributes one type of activity that specifies a recipient: phone call, appointment, letter, letter vial mail merge, fax, fax via mail merge, email, email via mail merge. The activities are distributed to recipients at one point in time.|  
|Marketing lists|You can distribute a campaign to the members of different marketing lists. Each campaign activity (`CampaignActivity`) may contain multiple lists. A marketing list contains the records of one type, such as accounts or leads. To distribute a campaign to accounts and leads, you must create two separate marketing lists.|A quick campaign can be distributed to the members of one marketing list, or to the accounts, contacts, or leads selected by a query.|  
|Campaign response|A reply to a campaign activity can be captured in the campaign response (`CampaignResponse`) and converted to an opportunity, lead, order, or quote.|The results of a quick campaign are captured in the quick campaign log (`BulkOperationLog`).|
