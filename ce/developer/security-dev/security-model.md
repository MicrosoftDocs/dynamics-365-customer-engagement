# Security model of Customer Engagement

[!INCLUDE[](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

[!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)] Customer Engagement provides a security model that protects data integrity and privacy, and supports efficient data access and collaboration. The goals of the model are as follows:  
  
- Provide users with the access only to the appropriate levels of information that is required to do their jobs.  
  
- Categorize users by role and restrict access based on those roles.  
  
- Support data sharing so that users and teams can be granted access to records that they do not own for a specified collaborative effort.  
  
- Prevent a user's access to records the user does not own or share.  
  
  **Role-based security** in [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] focuses on grouping a set of privileges together that describe the responsibilities (or tasks that can be performed) for a user. [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] includes a set of predefined security roles. Each aggregates a set of user rights to make user security management easier. Also, each application deployment can define its own roles to meet the needs of different users.  
  
  **Record-based security** in [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] focuses on access rights to specific records.  
  
  **Field-level security** in [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] restricts access to specific high business impact fields in an entity only to specified users or teams.  
  
  Combine role-based security, record-level security, and field-level security to define the overall security rights that users have within your custom [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] application.  
  
  More overview information about security can be found on the [Microsoft Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/TrustCenter/CloudServices/Dynamics365), and in this white paper: [Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online security and compliance planning guide](http://download.microsoft.com/download/B/4/A/B4A6FDE3-A5ED-43A8-99CB-E218E51AE106/Microsoft%20Dynamics%20CRM%20Online%20security%20and%20compliance%20planning%20guide.pdf).
