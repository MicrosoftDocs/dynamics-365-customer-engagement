# Organization entity attributes

[!INCLUDE[](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

The following information is for the organization entity in a default, uncustomized installation of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]. The schema name and early bound class for this entity is `Organization`. The Web API uses [Organization Entity](entities/organization.md).  

 The values set for these attributes control behaviors for the organization. They are usually set via the organization settings page in the application.  

> [!NOTE]
>  These attributes may refer to planned capabilities for future versions, deprecated capabilities, or capabilities not available for your deployment type. Donâ€™t experiment by changing these values programmatically unless you understand how they apply to your organization.
