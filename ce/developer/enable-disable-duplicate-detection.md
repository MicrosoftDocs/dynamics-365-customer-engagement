# Enable and Disable duplicate detection

[!INCLUDE[](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

This topic covers information on how to enable and disable duplicate detection in Dynamics 365.

<a name="bkmk_enable"></a>

## Enable duplicate detection

Before running duplicate detection, enable it for each of the following:  
  
-   Globally (for all entities in the organization).  
  
-   For an entity.  
  
-   For specific operations.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You must enable duplicate detection in all three areas to detect duplicates for an entity and for operations on an entity.  
  
### Enable duplicate detection globally  
  
-   Use the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.UpdateRequest> message to set the `Organization.IsDuplicateDetectionEnabled` attribute to `true`.
-   Read [Turn duplicate detection rules on or off for the whole organization](../admin/turn-duplicate-detection-rules-off-whole-organization.md) to find out how you can use the user interface to enable duplicate detection for the entire organization.
  
### Enable duplicate detection for an entity  
  
-   Use the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.UpdateRequest> message to set the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Metadata.EntityMetadata.IsDuplicateDetectionEnabled> property to `true`.  
  
### Enable duplicate detection for specific operations  
  
- Set the following attributes to `true`:  
  
  - `Organization.IsDuplicateDetectionEnabledForOnlineCreateUpdate`. Create and update records in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] by using the Web application or [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_full](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-full.md)]. This attribute enables or disables duplicate detection for records created or updated with the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.CreateRequest> and <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.UpdateRequest> messages. However, it does not affect records created or updated with the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.Create*> and <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.Update*> methods.  
  
  - `Organization.IsDuplicateDetectionEnabledForOfflineSync`. Synchronize offline records when [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_full](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-full.md)] goes from offline to online.  
  
  - `Organization.IsDuplicateDetectionEnabledForImport`. Import bulk data.  
  
  > [!NOTE]
  >  You do not have to publish the duplicate detection rules to enable duplicate detection for these operations. However, you must publish the duplicate detection rules before you perform the operations.

## Disable duplicate detection

Disable duplicate detection globally or for an entity type by unpublishing the duplicate detection rules or by deleting the published rules.  
  
 **Disable duplicate detection globally**  
  
 To disable duplicate detection globally, use the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.UpdateRequest> message to set the `Organization.IsDuplicateDetectionEnabled` attribute to `false`. This automatically unpublishes all duplicate detection rules for all entity types in the organization.  
  
 **Disable duplicate detection for an entity**  
  
 To disable duplicate detection for an entity type, do one of the following:  
  
-   Use the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.UpdateEntityRequest> message to set the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Metadata.EntityMetadata.IsDuplicateDetectionEnabled> property to `false`. This automatically unpublishes all duplicate detection rules for an entity type. This removes duplicate detection support for the entity type and you cannot create a new duplicate detection rule for this entity type.  
  
-   Unpublish all duplicate detection rules for an entity type by using the <xref:Microsoft.Crm.Sdk.Messages.UnpublishDuplicateRuleRequest> message.  
  
**Delete published duplicate detection rules**  
  
Delete all published rules in the system to disable duplicate detection globally, or delete published rules for specific entity types by using the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.Delete*> method.
