# Audit user access

[!INCLUDE[](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

[!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)] support the ability to audit user access. The information that is recorded includes when the user started accessing [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] and if access originated from the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] web application, [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)], or SDK calls to the web services.  
  
## Enable user access auditing  
 Auditing of user access is enabled at the organization level. To enable or disable user access auditing, you must retrieve the target organization’s record, and update the `Organization.IsUserAccessAuditEnabled` attribute value for the organization. Global auditing on the organization must also be enabled by setting the `Organization.IsAuditEnabled` attribute to `true` in the organization record. To audit the origin of user access, for example: web application, [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] or SDK, you must enable auditing on the entities being accessed.  
  
 The frequency of auditing user access can be read or set using the `Organization.UserAccessAuditingInterval` attribute. The default attribute value of 4 indicates user access is audited once every 4 hours.  
  
 For more information about enabling auditing for an organization and entity, see [Configure Entities and Attributes for Auditing](configure-entities-attributes-auditing.md).  
  
## Filter on user access events  
 To search for audit records that are related to user access, your code should retrieve `Audit` records of an organization and filter on the value in `Audit.Action`. An enumeration named `AuditAction` is provided to identify supported audit actions. The actions related to user access are shown in the following list.  
  
- `AuditAction.UserAccessviaWeb`  
  
- `AuditAction.UserAccessviaWebServices`  
  
- `AuditAction.UserAccessAuditStarted`  
  
- `AuditAction.UserAccessAuditStopped`  
  
  `UserAccessviaWeb` indicates access from the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] web application or [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Outlook_Short](../includes/pn-ms-outlook-short.md)]. `UserAccessviaWebServices` indicates a web service request from the SDK. The `AuditAction` enumeration is available to your code when you include `SampleCode\CS\HelperCode\OptionSets.cs` or `SampleCode\VB\HelperCode\OptionSets.vb` in your application’s project.
