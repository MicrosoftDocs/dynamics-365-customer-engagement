# Supported entities for asynchronous operations

[!INCLUDE[](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

The entities and messages that are supported in asynchronous operations are the same as the message and entity combinations that support plug-ins. For more information, see [Supported Messages and Entities for Plug-ins](supported-messages-entities-plugin.md).  
  
 Asynchronous operations are spawned to handle many types of [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] Customer Engagement operations, for example import/export, bulk operations, duplicate detection, recurring appointments, recurring (internal) system jobs, and more.
