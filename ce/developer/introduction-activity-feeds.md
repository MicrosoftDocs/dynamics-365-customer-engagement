# Introduction to activity feeds

[!INCLUDE[](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

As a developer implementing collaboration scenarios with  activity feeds, you should become familiar with the activity feeds terminology, definitions and entity model.  

<a name="BKMK_ActivityFeedsConcepts"></a>   
## Activity feeds concepts  
 The following table contains activity feeds definitions.  


|          Term           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

|       Record Wall       |                 A place in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] where activity feeds for a record, such as an account or lead, are displayed. In the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] web application, the record wall is shown as **What’s New** for the record. The record wall contains posts that are regarding the record or that mention the record. If a record is the system user (user), the wall also contains the posts that are created by the user.                 |
|                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|      Personal Wall      |                                                                                                                  A wall that is personal to a user. In the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] web application, it is user’s **What’s New** wall. This wall contains the posts about the records that the user is following, posts that are regarding the user or that mention the user.                                                                                                                   |
|        Auto Post        |                           A post generated by [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] by applying an auto post rule in case of an event, such as creation of an account or closure of a won opportunity. An auto post can be shown on a record wall or personal wall. The auto post text is localized. **Note:**  When creating a new opportunity, an auto post is generated, if one of the following attributes is specified: `CustomerId`, `ParentAccountId` or `ParentContactId`.                           |
| Manual Post (User Post) |                                                                                                                                                                                        A post created by a [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] user. A manual post can be shown on a record wall or personal wall.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|     Auto Post Rule      |                                                                                                                                            A rule that is used by [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] to generate an auto post when an event occurs. For example, a rule may specify to generate an auto post when a new opportunity is created for an account.                                                                                                                                            |

A comment is related to a parent post. It cannot exist without a parent post. If a parent post is deleted, the post’s comments are deleted also.                                                                                                                                                                         |
|         Follow          | An action taken by a user on a [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] record that enables that user to see the posts about the record on their personal wall. **Note:**  For [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_op_edition](../includes/pn-crm-onprem.md)], the maximum allowed number of records to follow is 5000. The default number of records that the user can follow is 1000. The default value is configurable and can be changed by an Administrator or a user with the permissions to modify the deployment settings. |

> [!NOTE]
>  Manual and auto posts that are created programmatically can have up to 2000 characters. Posts created in the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] web application can have up to 1000 characters. Comments that are created programmatically can have up to 1000 characters, but comments created in the web application are limited to 500 characters.

## Activity feeds entities  
 The following table contains information about the activity feeds entities.  

|Entity|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|`Post`|Represents an auto post or a manual (user) post.|  
|`PostComment`|Represents a comment on an activity feed post.|  
|`PostFollow`|Represents a post follow that indicates that a user follows a record. Deleting the `PostFollow` record is an action of “unfollow”.|  
|`PostLike`|Represents that the user liked the post.<br /><br /> Deleting the `PostLike` record is an action of “unlike”.|  
|`msdyn_PostConfig`|Contains activity feed configuration for an entity and is used to enable or disable an entity for activity feeds.|  
|`msdyn_PostRuleConfig`|Contains activity feed rule configuration for an entity and is used to enable or disable an auto post rule for an entity.|  
|`msdyn_PostAlbum`|Contains user profile images that are stored as attachments and displayed in posts.|  

<a name="BKMK_LikeUnlike"></a>   
## Like/Unlike  
 With Like/Unlike, you can express an immediate opinion about a post. This makes your communication more personable and interactive. Use Like/Unlike to exchange kudos with your co-workers, praise the work of your subordinates and measure the popularity of the posts. An action taken by the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] users showing that they like a particular post is called *Like*. An action taken by a [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] user to undo the “Like” on a post is called the *Unlike*. You can add one “Like” to the post; however, a post maybe “liked” by multiple users. To add a “Like” to a post, create the `PostLike` record and associate it with the parent `Post` record. To remove the “Like” from the post, delete the `PostLike` record.  

<a name="BKMK_Mentions"></a>   
## Mentions  
 During discussions within a group, you often need to reference a specific person (a [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] user), or a record, such as an account, and share this information with others. In [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] Activity Feeds, this action is called a “mention.” The posts that mention a user can be displayed on the user’s record wall and user’s personal wall (“What’s New” in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]). The posts that mention a record are displayed on the record’s wall.  

 To add a mention to a post, use an expression in the following format in the `Post.Text` attribute:  

 `@[Entity,ID,"Display String"]`.  

> [!NOTE]
>  There are no spaces following commas in this expression.  

 The following table describes the parameters in the expression:  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|`Entity`|An entity logical name or an entity type code for the record that is mentioned in the post.|  
|`ID`|The ID of the record that is mentioned in the post.|  
|`Display String`|The text that you want to be displayed in the mention, such as a record’s name.|  

 The entity type codes for all default (non-custom) entities are predefined. For more information, see [IOrganizationService Entities](org-service/organization-service-entities.md). [!INCLUDE[metadata_browser](../includes/metadata-browser.md)]  

 You can specify multiple mentions in this attribute. To retrieve data contained in the mention, parse the string in the `Text` attribute to search for the “@[“ characters that separate mentions from other mentions or text.  

 For additional information about post mentions, see [Blog Post: How to do Mentions with Activity Feeds](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/crm/archive/2011/10/31/how-to-do-mentions-with-activity-feeds.aspx).  

<a name="BKMK_DisplayingData"></a>   
## Displaying data on the record wall or personal wall  
 To retrieve posts for displaying on a record wall or a personal wall, you can use the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.RetrieveRequest> message or <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.RetrieveMultipleRequest> message. However, to retrieve pages of posts with associated comments and likes in one single call, you can use special activity feeds messages.  

 To retrieve pages of posts with associated comments and likes for a record wall, use the <xref:Microsoft.Crm.Sdk.Messages.RetrieveRecordWallRequest> message. To retrieve pages of posts with associated comments and likes for a personal wall, use the <xref:Microsoft.Crm.Sdk.Messages.RetrievePersonalWallRequest> message.  

 The following posts with comments are displayed on the **Record Wall:**  

- Posts that are regarding a record. The record ID is specified in the `Post.RegardingObjectId` attribute.  

- Posts that mention a record. The record ID is specified within the `Post.Text` attribute.  

- For a system user (user) record, the wall also includes the posts that the user created. The `Post.RegardingObjectId` attribute contains the current user ID.  

  The following posts with comments are displayed on the **Your (User) Personal Wall** (**What’s New** in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]):  

- Posts that are regarding you. The `Post.RegardingObjectId` attribute contains your user ID.  

- Posts that mention you. Your user ID is specified within the `Post.Text` attribute.  

- Posts that are regarding a record or that mention a record that you follow.  

> [!NOTE]
>  You can only follow the records on which you have read privileges and access rights. If you lose read permissions, a follow is automatically removed. All [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] users automatically follow themselves. You can only see the posts that are regarding the records or mention the records on which you have read privileges and access rights.  

 If you create the `PostFollow` record for the account A and set the `OwnerId` on the `PostFollow` to the user B, then the user B follows the account A.  

 For more information about the role-based and record-based security, see, [The Security Model of Dynamics 365](security-dev/security-model.md).
