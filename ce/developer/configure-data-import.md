# Configure data import

[!INCLUDE[](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

The configuration information that is required for importing data is contained in the data import (`Import`) entity and the import source file (`ImportFile`) entity.  
  
 To configure data import, do the following:  
  
- Use the `Import.ModeCode` attribute to specify whether to create or update data during import. If you are using early bound types, you can use the `ImportModeCode` enumeration. For a list of the ModeCode values, see the picklist values for this entity. [!INCLUDE[metadata_browser](../includes/metadata-browser.md)]  
  
- Use the `ImportFile.FileTypeCode` attribute to specify the type of the import file. If you are using early bound types, you can use the `ImportFileType` enumeration. For a list of the FileTypeCode values, see the picklist values for this entity. This attribute is only available in [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)].  
  
- Use the `ImportFile.DataDelimiterCode` attribute to specify the single character data delimiter in the import file. If you are using early bound types, you can use the `ImportDataDelimiter` enumeration. For a list of the ImportDataDelimiter values, see the picklist values for this entity.  
  
- Use the `ImportFile.FieldDelimiterCode` attribute to specify the single character field delimiter in the import file. If you are using early bound types, you can use the `ImportFieldDelimiter` enumeration. For a list of the FieldDelimiterCode values, see the picklist values for this entity.  
  
- Set `ImportFile.IsFirstRowHeader` to `true` to indicate that the first row in the source file contains column headings or to `false` to indicate that the first row contains actual data. If set to `false`, default column headings are generated.  
  
- Set `ImportFile.ImportId` to the ID of the import (data import) that the import file is associated with.  
  
- Set `ImportFile.ImportMapId` to the ID of the associated import map (data map).  
  
- Set `ImportFile.EnableDuplicateDetection` to `true` to enable duplicate detection during data import.  
  
- Read the content of the source file into the `ImportFile.Content`.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  We do not recommend updating records by using data import programmatically. To update, use the data export and import capabilities of the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] Web application. Use **Export to Excel** to export records to an XML Spreadsheet 2003 (.xml) file. This is the only valid source file type for the Update mode. Re-importing data from the XML Spreadsheet 2003 (.xml) source file ensures that the data integrity in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] is maintained. To import updated data, use the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] Import Data Wizard. For more information about the Import Data Wizard, see [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] Help.
