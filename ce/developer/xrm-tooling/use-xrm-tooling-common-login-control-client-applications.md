# Use the XRM tooling common login control in your client applications

[!INCLUDE[](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

There is a template for [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio](../../includes/pn-visual-studio.md)] that enables you to use the common login control in your client applications. The code for [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] authentication, credential storage and retrieval, and diagnostic logging is built into the template so that you can quickly leverage these capabilities in your Windows client applications for [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. The common login control is an implementation of the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.CrmConnectControl>, and the control resembles the following image.

## Create a WPF application using the common login control template
  
 Here is a quick way to create a [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Windows_Presentation_Foundation](../../includes/pn-ms-windows-presentation-foundation.md)] application that leverages the common login control and the underlying code for authentication, credential storage and reuse, and default tracing or logging.  
  
1. Start [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio](../../includes/pn-visual-studio.md)], and create a new project.  
  
2. In the **New Project** dialog box:  
  
   1. From the list of installed templates, expand **Visual C#**, and select **Dynamics 365 SDK Templates**.  
  
   2. Ensure that **[!INCLUDE[pn_NET_Framework_452_short](../../includes/pn-net-framework-452-short.md)]** is selected.  
  
   3. Select **WPF Application for Dynamics 365**.  
  
   4. Specify the name and location of the project, and click **OK**.  
  
   ![WPF Application for Dynamics 365 template](../media/crm-sdk-v6-xrmtooling-newproject.png "WPF Application for Dynamics 365 template")  
  
3. To test the project:  
  
   1. Save the project and press F5 or click **Debug** > **Start Debugging** to verify if the project compiles successfully. On successful compilation, you’ll see a MainWindow with **Login to Dynamics 365** button. Click the button to display the common login control.  
  
   2. Test the authentication by providing your credentials to connect to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], and then click **Login**. A message displays your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] connection status.  
  
   For a sample that uses the common login control template to connect to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] and perform various operations, see [Sample: Quick start for XRM Tooling API](sample-quick-start-xrm-tooling-api.md).

## Add the common login control template to your existing WPF application

 If you already have a WPF client application, you can easily add the common login control template to it to leverage the uniform sign-in experience and the underlying code for [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] authentication, credential storage and reuse, and default tracing or logging. In this case, you must create a control in the user interface of your existing client application to call the common login control, instantiate an instance of the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] connection object, and then use the connection object to perform various operations in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)].  
  
1. Open an existing WPF application project in [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio_short](../../includes/pn-visual-studio-short.md)]. For this example, let’s assume that the name of your WPF application project is SampleWPFApp.  
  
2. Add the common login control template to your project.  
  
   1.  In the **Solution Explorer** pane, right-click the project name, and click **Add** > **New Item**.  
  
   2.  In the **Add New Item** dialog box, from the list of installed templates, expand **Visual C#**, and select **Dynamics 365 SDK Templates**. Click **Dynamics 365 Login Form for WPF Applications**, and click **OK**.  
  
   ![Add the common login control template](../media/crm-sdk-v6-xrmtooling-addtemplate01.png "Add the common login control template")  
  
3. The newly added `CrmLoginForm1.xaml` login control is displayed in the XAML designer area. If it isn’t displayed, double-click the `CrmLoginForm1.xaml` file in the **Solution Explorer** pane.  
  
   ![Verify that the login control renders properly](../media/crm-sdk-v6-xrmtooling-addtemplate03.png "Verify that the login control renders properly")  
  
4. You must now call the newly added login control from your application. To do this, add a **Button** control on your MainWindow.xaml file, and set the name and content to **btnSignIn** and **Sign in to Dynamics 365** respectively.  
  
   ![Add a control to call the login form](../media/crm-sdk-v6-xrmtooling-addtemplate02.png "Add a control to call the login form")  
  
5. Double-click the button to add code for the click event of the **btnSignIn** button in the MainWindow.xaml.cs file.  
  
6. Add the following sample code in the click event of the **btnSignIn** button to call the CrmLoginForm1 control, and create an instance of the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] connection object.  
  
   ```csharp
   // Establish the Login control.  
   CRMLoginForm1 ctrl = new CRMLoginForm1();  
  
   // Wire event to login response.   
   ctrl.ConnectionToCrmCompleted += ctrl_ConnectionToCrmCompleted;  
  
   // Show the login control.   
   ctrl.ShowDialog();  
  
   // Handle the returned CRM connection object.  
   // On successful connection, display the CRM version and connected org name   
   if (ctrl.CrmConnectionMgr != null && ctrl.CrmConnectionMgr.CrmSvc != null && ctrl.CrmConnectionMgr.CrmSvc.IsReady)  
   {  
       MessageBox.Show("Connected to CRM! Version: " + ctrl.CrmConnectionMgr.CrmSvc.ConnectedOrgVersion.ToString() +   
       " Org: " + ctrl.CrmConnectionMgr.CrmSvc.ConnectedOrgUniqueName, "Connection Status");  
  
       // Perform your actions here  
   }  
   else  
   {  
       MessageBox.Show("Cannot connect; try again!", "Connection Status");  
   }  
   ```  
  
7. Add the definition of the `ctrl_ConnectionToCrmCompleted` event below the click event of the button:  
  
   ```csharp  
   private void ctrl_ConnectionToCrmCompleted(object sender, EventArgs e)  
   {  
       if (sender is CRMLoginForm1)  
       {  
           this.Dispatcher.Invoke(() =>  
           {  
               ((CRMLoginForm1)sender).Close();  
           });  
       }  
   }  
   ```  
  
8. This is how your MainWindow.xaml.cs file appears after adding code from the previous two steps:  
  
   ![Sample code](../media/crm-sdk-v6-xrmtooling-addtemplate04.png "Sample code")  
  
9. To test the project:  
  
   1. Save the project and press F5 or click **Debug** > **Start Debugging** to verify if the project compiles successfully. On successful compilation, you will see a MainWindow with the new **Sign In to Dynamics 365** button. Click it to display the common login control.  
  
   2. Test the authentication by providing your credentials to connect to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], and then click **Login**. If successful, a message appears stating the version and the organization name that you are connected to. Click **OK** to close the message.  
  
   ![Project test results](../media/crm-sdk-v6-xrmtooling-addtemplate05.png "Project test results")  
  
    3.  If you click **Sign In to Dynamics 365** again, the application prompts you to either choose the saved credentials from the last sign-in activity, or to re-enter the new credentials.  
  
   ![Stored credentials](../media/crm-sdk-v6-xrmtooling-addtemplate06.png "Stored credentials")
