# Model your business data

[!INCLUDE[](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

[!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps provides a robust and customizable data model that uses entities to define the data tracked in the system. This section describes the out-of-the-box entities that correspond to the areas shown in the web application. These entities are defined by metadata. For more information about how to customize entities, see [The Metadata and Data Models in Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps](metadata-data-models.md).
