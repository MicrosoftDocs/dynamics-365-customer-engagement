# Write plug-ins to extend business processes
A plug-in is custom business logic that you can integrate with [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)] Customer Engagement to modify or augment the standard behavior of the platform. Plug-ins are event handlers since they are registered to execute in response to a particular event being fired by the platform.  
  
 The following topics describe how to add custom business logic to [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] through the development and registration of plug-ins. For more information about the run-time execution of plug-ins and the plug-in development framework, see [Introduction to the Event Framework](introduction-event-framework.md).  
  
 You can also extend the functionality of [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] by using processes. For more information, see the related link below.
