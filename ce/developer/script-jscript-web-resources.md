# Script(JScript) web resources

[!INCLUDE[](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Use Script(JScript) web resources to create a library of [!INCLUDE[pn_JavaScript](../includes/pn-javascript.md)] functions that can be accessed from anywhere.  
  
<a name="BKMK_capabilities"></a>   
## Capabilities of script web resources  
 With [!INCLUDE[pn_JavaScript](../includes/pn-javascript.md)] web resources, you can more efficiently manage code used in form scripts, webpage (HTML) web resources, or ribbon commands by linking them to shared library of [!INCLUDE[pn_JavaScript](../includes/pn-javascript.md)] functions.  
  
<a name="BKMK_limitations"></a>   
## Limitations of script web resources  
 Like all web resources, [!INCLUDE[pn_JavaScript](../includes/pn-javascript.md)] web resources use the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] web application security context. Only licensed [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] users who have the necessary privileges can access them.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  References included in code between web resources arenâ€™t tracked as solution dependencies.  
  
<a name="BKMK_Using"></a>   
## Using JavaScript libraries  
 For information about developing and testing [!INCLUDE[pn_JavaScript](../includes/pn-javascript.md)] libraries as well as how to associate them with ribbon commands and form events, see [Client scripting in Customer Engagement using JavaScript](clientapi/client-scripting.md).  
  
<a name="BKMK_Referencing"></a>   
## Referencing a script web resource from a webpage web resource  
 All web resources can use relative URLs to reference each other. In the following example, for the webpage web resource `new_/content/contentpage.htm` to reference the [!INCLUDE[pn_JavaScript](../includes/pn-javascript.md)] web resource `new_/scripts/myScript.js`, add the following HTML code to the head element of `new_/content/contentpage.htm`.  
  
```html  
<script type="text/jscript" src="../scripts/myScript.js"></script>  
```  
  
 To reference a [!INCLUDE[pn_JavaScript](../includes/pn-javascript.md)] from a different publisher, the path must include the customization prefix for that publisher. For example, for the `new_/content/contentpage.htm` page to reference the `MyIsv_/scripts/customscripts.js` page, the `src` attribute value should be `../../MyIsv_/scripts/customscripts.js`.
