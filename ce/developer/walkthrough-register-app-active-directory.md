# Walkthrough: Register a Dynamics 365 app with Active Directory

[!INCLUDE[](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

This walkthrough describes how to register a desktop client or mobile application so that it can connect to and authenticate with the [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] Customer Engagement server and access the Web services. Once registered, an application can access the Web services using HTTP requests through the server’s SOAP or Web API endpoints.  
  
[!INCLUDE[cc_sdk_onpremises_note](../includes/cc-sdk-onpremises-note.md)] 

## Prerequisites  
 For an on-premises or Internet-facing deployment (IFD):  
  
- A [!INCLUDE[pn_windows_server_2012_r2](../includes/pn-windows-server-2012-r2.md)] with [!INCLUDE[pn_adfs_short](../includes/pn-adfs-short.md)].  
  
- You must have administrator access to the server hosting the [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] deployment services role and the [!INCLUDE[pn_adfs_short](../includes/pn-adfs-short.md)] server.  
  
- The on-premises server must be configured to use claims authentication.  
  
- The redirect URL for your application. Instructions for finding that URL are provided in the section named [Obtain the redirect URL](walkthrough-register-app-active-directory.md#bkmk_redirect).  
  
<a name="bkmk_redirect"></a>   
## Obtain the redirect URI  
 One method to obtain the redirect URI for a native client [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Windows_short](../includes/pn-ms-windows-short.md)] application is to execute the following line of code in a debug session of your application and examine the returned URI value. In a WinJS debug session, select the `RawUri` property.  
  
```csharp  
string redirectUri = WebAuthenticationBroker.GetCurrentApplicationCallbackUri().ToString();  
```  
  
```vb  
Dim redirectUri As String = WebAuthenticationBroker.GetCurrentApplicationCallbackUri().ToString()  
```  
  
```javascript  
Windows.Security.Authentication.Web.WebAuthenticationBroker.getCurrentApplicationCallbackUri()  
```  
  
 The `WebAuthenticationBroker` class can be found in the `Windows.Security.Authentication.Web` namespace. Use the string value returned from the method call when you register the app. 
 
 <!--The C# line of code is shown in the topic [Sample: Windows 8 desktop modern OData app](sample-windows-8-desktop-modern-odata-app.md).  -->
  
 For a non-[!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Windows_short](../includes/pn-ms-windows-short.md)] native client application such as a console application, use any valid URI value. In this case, the URI doesn’t need to actually exist but it must be unique in the tenant.

## App registration for Dynamics 365 on-premises (IFD)  
 **Scenario**: A customer or other person registers a custom application to access organization data on a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] server provided by an ISV or Partner.  
  
#### The ISV or Partner performs the following tasks:  
  
1. Configures the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] on-premises (IFD) server and [!INCLUDE[pn_adfs_short](../includes/pn-adfs-short.md)] server using [!INCLUDE[pn_PowerShell](../includes/pn-powershell.md)] commands that are provided later in this section.  
  
2. Provides the client ID and server address URL information to the customer.  
  
#### The customer or other person performs the following tasks:  
  
1.  Configures the external application by entering the client ID and server address URL in the app as instructed.  
  
### [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] server setup  
 To configure the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] server to enable federated claims, follow these steps.  
  
##### Configure claims settings  
  
1. Log on as administrator on the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] server that hosts the deployment service role and open a [!INCLUDE[pn_PowerShell](../includes/pn-powershell.md)] command window.  
  
2. Add the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)][!INCLUDE[pn_PowerShell](../includes/pn-powershell.md)] snap-in (Microsoft.Crm.PowerShell.dll). [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Administer the deployment using Windows PowerShell](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn531202.aspx)  
  
   ```powershell  
   Add-PSSnapin Microsoft.Crm.PowerShell  
   ```  
  
3. Enter the following [!INCLUDE[pn_PowerShell](../includes/pn-powershell.md)] commands.  
  
   ```powershell  
  
   $ClaimsSettings = Get-CrmSetting -SettingType OAuthClaimsSettings  
   $ClaimsSettings.Enabled = $true  
   Set-CrmSetting -Setting $ClaimsSettings  
  
   ```  
  
<a name="bkmk_adfs"></a>   
### AD FS server setup  
 To register the external application with [!INCLUDE[pn_adfs_short](../includes/pn-adfs-short.md)], follow these steps.  
  
##### Register the application in Active Directory  
  
1. Log on to the [!INCLUDE[pn_adfs_short](../includes/pn-adfs-short.md)] server as administrator and open a [!INCLUDE[pn_PowerShell](../includes/pn-powershell.md)] command window.  
  
2. Enter the following command.  
  
   ```powershell  
   Add-AdfsClient -ClientId <CLIENT_ID> -Name <APP_NAME> -RedirectUri <REDIRECT_URI>  
   ```  
  
    Where <CLIENT_ID> is a unique number, <APP_NAME> is a name for the application, and <REDIRECT_URI> is any valid URI that [!INCLUDE[pn_adfs_short](../includes/pn-adfs-short.md)] is to redirect to after authentication has completed. It is recommended that the client ID be a GUID. You can generate a GUID in [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio](../includes/pn-visual-studio.md)] by opening the **Tools** menu and clicking **Create GUID**.
