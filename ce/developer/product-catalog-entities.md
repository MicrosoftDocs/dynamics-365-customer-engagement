# Product catalog entities

[!INCLUDE[](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

A product catalog is a collection of products with their pricing information. The *product catalog* entities let you create a rich product classification system in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] that provides support for:  
  
- Defining hierarchical structure of product families and products with configurable properties (attributes) that help you reduce the number of product stock keeping units (SKUs) needed to maintain your product catalog.  
  
- Selling individual products or grouping them into bundles and kits. A bundle or a kit is a collection of products that is sold as single unit. Product bundling is useful in grouping products in a way that customers get more benefit from the full line of products or to offer discounts on bundled products.  
  
  > [!NOTE]
  >  Kits are deprecated in the current release of [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. You should use bundles instead.  
  
- Defining related products in the system (substitute, cross-sell, up-sell, or accessory). The related products for a product are displayed as suggestions to the sales agents when they add the product to an opportunity, quote, order, or invoice.  
  
- Defining multiple pricing and discounting models. You can also use custom pricing instead of the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] system pricing to calculate prices when you associate a product or bundle to an opportunity, quote, order, or invoice. Further, you can select whether to apply discounts for products at the per-unit or line level.  
  
- Specify whether you want the price level (price list) to be automatically set for an opportunity, quote, order, or invoice based on the sales territory relationship of the user.  
  
- Specifying localized values for certain product properties (attributes) to make the product names and descriptions available in the user-preferred languages.  
  
  Use the following entities in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] to manage your product catalog.

|                         `Product`                         | A *product* is either a physical inventory item (such as lumber or a nail), or a service (such as a haircut or tree pruning) that a company sells. Products from the product catalog can be used to build quotes and orders, and can be associated with opportunities or service cases. In addition, each product can contain links to sales literature and links to information about competitors and their products.
