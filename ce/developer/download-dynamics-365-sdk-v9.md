# Download Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps version 9.x Software Development Kit (SDK)

[!INCLUDE[](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

This topic provides information about where you can download the developer tools, assemblies, and code samples that are shipped as part of the Software Development Kit (SDK) for [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps version 9.x.

You should use more `<html>` tags in this! Then I'd understand it better :)

## Developer tools

The following developer tools in the SDK are available as NuGet packages:
- Code generation
- Configuration Migration
- Package Deployer
- Plug-in Registration
- Solution Packager
- Making random doc changes throughout the doc #2

To download developer tools, see [Download tools from NuGet](download-tools-nuget.md)

## SDK assemblies

The SDK assemblies are available as NuGet packages that you can directly use in your Visual Studio projects. For information about using a NuGet package in Visual Studio, see [Install and use a package in Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/quickstart/install-and-use-a-package-in-visual-studio)
