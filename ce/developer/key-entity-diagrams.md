# Key to entity diagrams

[!INCLUDE[](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

The following is the key to the entity model diagrams shown in the [!INCLUDE [pn-sdk](../includes/pn-sdk.md)] for [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)] apps. The relationships to the organization, business unit, and system user (user) entities have been filtered out to simplify the diagrams. The color coding shows if the entity is owned by one of these entities.  
  
 ![Diagram key for Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement entity relationship diagrams](media/key-entity-diagrams.png "Diagram key for Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement entity relationship diagrams")  
  
 All entity diagrams in the SDK were generated using the metadata diagram sample code that reads the metadata and uses [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_office_visio](../includes/pn-microsoft-office-visio.md)] to draw an entity relationship diagram. Download the complete sample of [Generate entity diagrams with the metadata diagram tool](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Sample-of-generating-a0ba0e47). The folder contains a readme file with instructions for its use.
