# Annotation (note) entity

[!INCLUDE[](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

The *annotations (notes)* provide easy ways to append additional information to any record in the 
[!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] database. An annotation (note) is a text entry that can be associated with any entity in 
[!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. However, you can associate annotations with only those custom entities that are created with 
the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.CreateEntityRequest.HasNotes> property set to `true` in the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.CreateEntityRequest> class. You can update a 
custom entity, which is not enabled for notes, to have notes by setting the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.UpdateEntityRequest>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.UpdateEntityRequest.HasNotes> property to `true`.  

Using the Web API, set the `HasNotes` property of the <xref:Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.EntityMetadata> EntityType controls this.
  
 The `Annotation` entity represents an annotation (note), and contains the following information:  
  
- Annotation (note) text  
  
- Who created and modified the annotation (note)  
  
- Whether a file is attached to the annotation (note)  
  
  An attached file can be any standard computer file format that includes [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Word_Full](../includes/pn-ms-word-full.md)] documents, [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Excel_Full](../includes/pn-ms-excel-full.md)] spreadsheets, CAD files, and PDF files. An attachment can be associated with any object, other than an annotation (note), in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)].  
  
  To upload or remove an attachment, use the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.Update*> method or <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.UpdateRequest> message, setting the `Annotation.Filename` and `Annotation.MimeType` properties. This uploads an attachment that has been decoded into a base64 string format. The [System.Convert.ToBase64String](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.convert.tobase64string.aspx) method can be used to convert the contents of a data file into a base64-formatted string.
