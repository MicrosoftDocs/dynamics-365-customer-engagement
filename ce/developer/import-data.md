# Import data

[!INCLUDE[](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

If you want to import data into [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)], you can use the *data import* feature. Data import lets you upload data from various customer relationship management systems and data sources into [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]. You can import data into standard and customized attributes of most business and custom entities. You can also include related data, such as notes and attachments.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] includes a web application tool called Import Data Wizard. You use this tool to import data records from one or more comma-separated values (.csv), XML Spreadsheet 2003 (.xml), or text files.  
  
 For more information about the Import Data Wizard, see [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] Help.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] web services provide the following additional capabilities that aren’t available in the Import Data Wizard:  
  
- Create data maps that include complex transformation mapping, such as concatenation, split, and replace.  
  
- Define custom transformation mapping.  
  
- View source data that is stored inside the temporary parse tables.  
  
- Access error logs to build custom error reporting tools with improved error logging views.  
  
- Run data import by using command-line scripts.  
  
- Add `LookupMap`XML tags in the data map to indicate that the data lookup will be initiated and performed on a source file that is used in the import.  
  
- Add custom `OwnerMetadata`XML tags in the data map to match the user records in the source file with the records of the user (system user) in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].  
  
- Use optional validation checks.  
  
  > [!NOTE]
  >  Validation isn’t optional in the Import Data Wizard.  
  
  To implement data import, you typically do the following:  
  
- Create a comma-separated values (CSV), XML Spreadsheet 2003 (XMLSS), or text source file.  
  
- Create a data map or use an existing data map.  
  
- Associate an import file with a data map.  
  
- Upload the content from a source file to the associated import file.  
  
- Parse the import file.  
  
- Transform the parsed data.  
  
- Upload the transformed data into the target [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] server.  
  
  You can import data from one source file or several source files. A source file can contain data for one entity type or multiple entity types.  
  
  Parsing, transforming, and uploading of data is done by the asynchronous jobs that run in the background.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  By default, all custom entities are enabled for import. To determine if a business entity is enabled for import, see the entity metadata for the specific entity. If an entity is enabled for import, the entity metadata property `IsImportable` is set to `true`. The value of this property can’t be changed for the out-of-the-box business entities.
