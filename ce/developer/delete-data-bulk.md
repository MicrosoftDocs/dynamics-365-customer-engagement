# Delete data in bulk

[!INCLUDE[](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

The *bulk deletion* feature helps you to maintain data quality and manage the consumption of system storage in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] by deleting data that you no longer need.  
  
 For example, you can delete the following data in bulk:  
  
- Stale data.  
  
- Data that is irrelevant to the business.  
  
- Unneeded test or sample data.  
  
- Data that is incorrectly imported from other systems.  
  
  With bulk deletion you can perform the following operations:  
  
- Delete data across multiple entities.  
  
- Delete records for a specified entity.  
  
- Receive email notifications when a bulk deletion finishes.  
  
- Delete data periodically.  
  
- Schedule the start time of a recurring bulk delete.  
  
- Retrieve the information about the failures that occurred during a bulk deletion.
