# Field-level data encryption

[!INCLUDE[](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

[!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)] uses standard [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_SQL_Server](../includes/pn-ms-sql-server.md)] cell level encryption for a set of default entity attributes that contain sensitive information, such as user names and email passwords. This feature can help organizations meet the compliance requirements associated with FIPS 140-2. Field-level data encryption is especially important in scenarios that leverage the [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_E-Mail_Router](../includes/pn-crm-e-mail-router.md)], which must store user names and passwords to enable integration between a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] instance and an email service such as [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Exchange](../includes/pn-microsoft-exchange.md)].  
  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] users who have the system administrator security role can activate data encryption (or change the encryption key after data encryption is enabled) in the **Settings** > **Data Management** > **Data Encryption** area. After data encryption is activated, it cannot be turned off.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  For both [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)], all new and upgraded organizations have data encryption activated.  
> 
>  When considering the use of data encryption, be sure to keep in mind the following key points:  
> 
> - To help ensure the highest level of security, we recommend that you change the encryption key immediately after creating or updating an organization, and thereafter about once a year.  
>   - Changing the encryption key requires that [!INCLUDE[pn_ssl_short](../includes/pn-ssl-short.md)] be configured on the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] website.  
>   - Auditing cannot be enabled on encrypted fields.  
>   - Encrypted fields cannot be customized.  
>   - Encrypted fields cannot be indexed.  
>   - Encrypted fields can be set and updated by using standard Create, Update, and Delete methods.  
>   - When doing a retrieve of an encrypted field’s value, a **null** is returned.  
  
 The encryption key is required to activate data encryption when you import an organization database into a new deployment or into a deployment that has had the configuration database (MSCRM_CONFIG) recreated after the organization was encrypted. You can copy the original encryption key to Notepad and then paste it into the **Settings** > **Data Management** > **Data Encryption** dialog box after the organization import is completed. When activating data encryption after redeployment, we recommend that you use [!INCLUDE[pn_Internet_Explorer](../includes/pn-internet-explorer.md)] to paste the encryption key into the **Data Encryption** dialog box.  
  
## Encrypted attributes  
 The entity attributes that are configured for field-level data encryption are listed in the following table.  
  
|Entity|Attribute|  
|------------|---------------|  
|EmailServerProfile|IncomingPassword|  
|EmailServerProfile|OutgoingPassword|  
|Mailbox|Password|  
|Queue|EmailPassword|  
|UserSettings|EmailPassword|  
  
## Messages  
 The messages that can be used for field-level data encryption are listed in the following table.  
  
|Request class name|More information|  
|------------------------|----------------------|  
|<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.IsDataEncryptionActiveRequest>|Checks if data encryption is currently running (active or inactive).|  
|<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.RetrieveDataEncryptionKeyRequest>|Retrieves the data encryption key value.|  
|<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.SetDataEncryptionKeyRequest>|Sets or restores the data encryption key. To prevent accidentally running multiple change requests in parallel, this SDK message will be throttled so that only one request can run at a time.|  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You must use [!INCLUDE[pn_ssl_short](../includes/pn-ssl-short.md)] when you use these messages. When you execute these messages, a check will ensure that the user’s client/server connectivity is using the HTTPS protocol. If not, an exception is returned if the requests are submitted without using HTTPS.
