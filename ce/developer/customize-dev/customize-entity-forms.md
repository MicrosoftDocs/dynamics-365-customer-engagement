# Customize entity forms

[!INCLUDE[](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Forms provide the user interface (UI) that people use to create, view, or edit entity records. Use the form designer in the customization tools to create and edit entity forms. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Create and design forms](../../customize/create-design-forms.md) for information about tasks related to working with forms in the application.  

 This topic will provide information necessary to create or edit forms programmatically.  

<a name="BKMK_AccessingFormDefinitions"></a>   

## Access form definitions  
 Entity forms are stored in the `SystemForm` entity along with dashboards and visualizations. There are two ways that you can inspect the form definitions for an entity:  

-   Include the entity in an unmanaged solution and export the solution.  

-   Query the `SystemForm` entity  

<a name="BKMK_ViewingFormXml"></a>   

### View FormXML from an exported entity  
 Only definitions of system entity forms that have been customized are included in exported managed solution. To view the definition of a system entity form, you must either change it in some way, or create a new form by saving the existing form with a new name.  

 After you export the solution, extract the contents and view the customizations.xml file. You’ll find the definition of the forms in `ImportExportXml` > `Entities` > `Entity` > `FormXml`. 
 In the `<FormXml>` node, you’ll find each type of form is grouped in a `<forms>` element with the `type` attribute specifying the type of form.  

<a name="BKMK_FormProperties"></a>   
## Form properties  
 The following table describes key `SystemForm` entity attributes and the corresponding data included in the XML elements exported with the solution.

## Create and edit forms  
 You can only create new forms for an entity where <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Metadata.EntityMetadata>. <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Metadata.EntityMetadata.CanCreateForms> allows it.  

 You can create new forms using either a <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.CreateRequest> or the <xref:Microsoft.Crm.Sdk.Messages.CopySystemFormRequest>. When using <xref:Microsoft.Crm.Sdk.Messages.CopySystemFormRequest> or using **Save As** in the form editor, note that there is no inheritance between forms. Therefore, changes to the base form aren’t automatically applied to any forms created from it.  

 Editing the form definitions from an exported managed solution and then re-importing the solution is a supported method to edit entity forms. When manually editing forms we strongly recommend you use an XML editor that allows for schema validation.
