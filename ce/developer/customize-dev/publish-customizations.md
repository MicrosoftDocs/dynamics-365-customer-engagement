# Publish customizations

[!INCLUDE[](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Publishing customizations makes the Web application aware of changes to the data that affects the user interface.  
  
<a name="BKMK_WhenToPublishCustomizations"></a>   
## When to publish customizations  
 Customizations are automatically published when new items are created or existing items are deleted.  
  
 You must publish changes after updating schema metadata or entities that affect the user interface. You can decide to wait and publish a set of related changes together.  
  
 Only published customizations are exported with a solution. You should always publish customizations before exporting a solution.  
  
 When you perform customizations that will appear in [!INCLUDE[pn_moca_full](../../includes/pn-moca-full.md)], you should always explicitly publish your customizations to make sure that every item is synchronized with the [!INCLUDE[pn_moca_short](../../includes/pn-moca-short.md)] application.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Publishing customizations can interfere with normal system operation. In a production environment, we recommend that you schedule publishing customizations when itâ€™s least disruptive to users.  
  
## Publishing programmatically  
 The following table lists the two messages that you can use to publish customizations.  
  
|Message|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|<xref:Microsoft.Crm.Sdk.Messages.PublishAllXmlRequest>|Publishes all customizations.|  
|<xref:Microsoft.Crm.Sdk.Messages.PublishXmlRequest>|Publishes the specified customizations.|  
  
 When you use the `PublishXmlRequest` message, you specify which items you want to publish by using the <xref:Microsoft.Crm.Sdk.Messages.PublishXmlRequest.ParameterXml> parameter. `ParameterXML` must comply with the [Publish Request Schema](publish-request-schema.md).  
  
<a name="BKMK_RetrieveUnpublishedMetadata"></a>   
## Retrieving unpublished metadata  
 If you want to create an application to edit customizable items in [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] Customer Engagement, you must retrieve any unpublished definitions of those items. If a developer defines some changes but does not publish them, your application must be able to retrieve them to display them in the user interface.  
  
 Use the following two methods to retrieve unpublished metadata:  
  
 **RetrieveAsIfPublished parameter**  
 Retrieves entity, attribute, entity relationship, and option set data by using the following messages:  
  
- <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.RetrieveAllEntitiesRequest>  
  
- <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.RetrieveAllOptionSetsRequest>  
  
- <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.RetrieveAttributeRequest>  
  
- <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.RetrieveEntityRequest>  
  
- <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.RetrieveOptionSetRequest>  
  
- <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.RetrieveRelationshipRequest>  
  
  **RetrieveUnpublished Request**  
  Retrieves user interface items, such as form, template, visualization and Web resource definitions, by using the following messages:  
  
- <xref:Microsoft.Crm.Sdk.Messages.RetrieveUnpublishedRequest>  
  
- <xref:Microsoft.Crm.Sdk.Messages.RetrieveUnpublishedMultipleRequest>
