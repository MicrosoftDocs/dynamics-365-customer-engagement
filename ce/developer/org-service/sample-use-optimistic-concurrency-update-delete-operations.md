# Sample: Use optimistic concurrency with update and delete operations

[!INCLUDE[](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Demonstrates how to use the optimistic concurrency feature, introduced in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_2015_update_1](../../includes/pn-crm-online-2015-update-1.md)], to prevent potential data loss when doing an update or delete of entity records. For more details about the technique used, refer to this topic: [Reduce potential data loss using optimistic concurrency](reduce-potential-data-loss-using-optimistic-concurrency.md)  

 The complete sample can be downloaded at [Use optimistic concurrency with update and delete operations](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Use-optimistic-concurrency-e0b0440d).  

## Prerequisites  
 To run this sample you must have:  

- Access to a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_2016_update](../../includes/pn-crm-online-2016-update.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_2016](../../includes/pn-crm-2016.md)] on-premises organization.  

- [!INCLUDE[pn_NET_Framework_452_long](../../includes/pn-net-framework-452-long.md)] installed on your development computer.  

- An active Internet connection for the required [!INCLUDE[tn_nuget](../../includes/tn-nuget.md)] packages to automatically download when building the sample.

## What this sample does  
 This sample shows how to use optimistic concurrency for update and delete operations. Code snippets showing just the key sections of the sample are shown. This sample sets the concurrency behavior on the update and delete requests so the server will check for a specific version of an account record for those operations. If the update or delete operations are attempted using a record with a different row version, an exception results. Otherwise, the operation is successful.

## Install NuGet packages  

1. Download this sample and extract the files.  

2. Navigate to the C# folder and open the solution file in [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio](../../includes/pn-visual-studio.md)].  

3. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the project and click **Manage NuGet Packages**.  

4. In the drop down list at the top of the dialog, click **Include Prerelease** if you’re using a [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] Preview organization. Otherwise, click **Stable Only**.  

5. Close the dialog.  

   The required packages are automatically installed when you build the solution.

## Run the sample  

1. In [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio_short](../../includes/pn-visual-studio-short.md)], press F5 to build and run the sample. You’ll be prompted to accept the licenses for the [!INCLUDE[tn_nuget](../../includes/tn-nuget.md)] packages that are to be installed.  

2. If you haven’t previously run one of the [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] Customer Engagement managed code samples before, you’ll need to enter information to run the code. Otherwise, enter the number for one of the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] servers you have previously set up.
