# Sample: Query metadata and detect changes

[!INCLUDE[](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

This sample code is for [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)] Customer Engagement. Download the sample: [Query metadata and detect changes](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Sample-for-query-metadata-98848365).

## Prerequisites
[!INCLUDE[sdk-prerequisite](../../includes/sdk-prerequisite.md)]
  
## Requirements  
[!INCLUDE[sdk_SeeConnectionHelper](../../includes/sdk-seeconnectionhelper.md)]
  
## Demonstrates  
 This sample shows how to use the classes and methods in the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Metadata.Query> and <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Metadata> namespaces to query for specific items of metadata and then track changes to the organization metadata.  
  
## Example  
 This sample creates an in-memory cache of all option-set option labels for certain entities. Then, a custom entity that contains OptionSet attributes is added and the cache of option-set option labels is updated. Then a single option is added to one of the custom OptionSet attributes and the cache is updated to add it. Finally, the custom entity is deleted and the cache of option-set option labels is again updated to reflect this change.  
  
 The sample will display output similar to the following when it is complete.  
  
- 463 option labels for 5 entities added to the cache.  
  
- ClientVersionStamp: 296297!10/22/2012 21:41:57  
  
- Adding a custom entity named sample_SampleEntityForMetadataQuery with a custom optionset attribute named : sample_ExampleOptionSet  
  
- 8 option labels for 1 entities were added to the cache.  
  
- 471 Option Labels cached  
  
- No Option Labels removed.  
  
- ClientVersionStamp: 296646!10/22/2012 21:42:06  
  
- Adding an additional option to the sample_ExampleOptionSet attribute options.  
  
- 1 option labels for 1 entities were added to the cache.  
  
- 472 Option Labels cached  
  
- No Option Labels removed.  
  
- ClientVersionStamp: 296649!10/22/2012 21:42:16  
  
- Current Options: 472  
  
- Deleting the sample_SampleEntityForMetadataQuery custom entity  
  
- No option labels were added to the cache.  
  
- 9 Option Labels removed  
  
- 463 Total Option Labels currently cached  
  
- ClientVersionStamp: 297079!10/22/2012 21:42:34
