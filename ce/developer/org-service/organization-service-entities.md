# Organization service entities

[!INCLUDE[](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

The following table lists the entities available in default deployments of [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)] Customer Engagement. It may be easier for you to see this using the metadata browser. [!INCLUDE[metadata_browser](../../includes/metadata-browser.md)]  

 The table below shows the default display name, whether the entity can be customized, the ownership type, and whether the entity is available offline. For the most part, customizable entities appear in the customization UI in the web application, while the others do not. The display name of a customizable entity may be changed through system customization.  

 The schema name is also the class name used for early-bound programming, however, not all entities support an early-bound class. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Create Early Bound Entity Classes with the Code Generation Tool (CrmSvcUtil.exe)](create-early-bound-entity-classes-code-generation-tool.md).  

 For a list of intersect entities (used for creating queries), see [Retrieve Records for Many-To-Many Relationships using Intersect Entities](retrieve-records-many-to-many-relationships-intersect-entities.md).
