# Entity and attribute naming conventions

[!INCLUDE[](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

In [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] Customer Engagement, the programming method you use to access  data determines the naming convention you use.  
  
 When you use the strongly typed classes generated by the code generation tool (CrmSvcUtil.exe) or when you use the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Client.OrganizationServiceContext> class, you’re programming with early binding. With early-binding programming, you use the schema name of an entity or attribute. Schema names are defined in the `Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Metadata.EntityMetadata`.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Metadata.EntityMetadata.SchemaName> and `Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Metadata.AttributeMetadata`.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Metadata.AttributeMetadata.SchemaName> properties.  
  
 The following code example shows early binding and uses schema names.  
  
```csharp  
// Create new account using early binding and a context object.  
AWCServiceContext context = new AWCServiceContext(_serviceProxy);  
Account account = new Account()    
{  
  Name = "Contoso Services Extensions",  
         EMailAddress1 = "contoso-Ext@contoso.com"  
};  
  
// Create an account record.context.AddToAccountSet(account);  
context.SaveChanges();  
```  
  
 When you use the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Entity> class, you are programming with late binding. With late-binding programming, you use the logical name of an entity or attribute. Logical names are defined in the `Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Metadata.EntityMetadata`.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Metadata.EntityMetadata.LogicalName> and `Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Metadata.AttributeMetadata`.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Metadata.AttributeMetadata.LogicalName> properties.  
  
 The following code example shows late binding and uses logical names.  
  
```csharp  
//Create new account using late binding and the Entity class.  
Entity accountentity = new Entity("account");  
accountentity["name"] = "Contoso Services Extensions";  
accountentity["emailaddress1"] = "contoso-Ext@contoso.com";  
  
// Create an account record.  
_accountId =_serviceProxy.Create(accountentity);  
```  
  
 To find the logical and schema names for each entity, see the metadata for each entity. [!INCLUDE[metadata_browser](../../includes/metadata-browser.md)] The generated strongly-typed classes file also shows the logical and schema names for each entity and attribute.
