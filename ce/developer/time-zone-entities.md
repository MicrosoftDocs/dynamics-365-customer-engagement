# Time zone entities

[!INCLUDE[](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

The *time zone* entities can be used when you write code that works in multiple time zones. The following three read-only entities in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] contain time zone information:  
  
- The *time zone definition entity* stores basic information about each supported time zone, including the time zone code and the standard time zone name.  
  
- The *time zone localized name* entity stores the localized time zone names.  
  
- The *time zone rule* entity stores information about how times are calculated.  
  
  The following table lists the messages that are related to time zones, but donâ€™t refer to a specific entity.  
  
|Message|Description|

|<xref:Microsoft.Crm.Sdk.Messages.GetTimeZoneCodeByLocalizedNameRequest>|Retrieves all the time zone definitions for the specified locale, returning only the display name attribute.|  
|<xref:Microsoft.Crm.Sdk.Messages.LocalTimeFromUtcTimeRequest>|Retrieves the local time for the specified UTC time.|
