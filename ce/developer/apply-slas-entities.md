# Apply SLAs to entities

[!INCLUDE[](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Service level agreements (SLAs) in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] help you define the level of service or support that your organization agrees to offer a customer by including items to define metrics or key performance indicators (KPIs) to attain the service level. You can apply SLAs to custom entities and the following system entities:  
  
-   All activity entities (such as Email, Task, and Appointment) except recurring appointments (RecurringAppointmentMaster)  
  
-   Account  
  
-   Contact  
  
-   Invoice  
  
-   Incident (Case)  
  
-   Opportunity  
  
-   Quote  
  
-   Lead  
  
-   SalesOrder (Order)  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  SLA support for entities, in addition to the Incident entity, was introduced in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_8_1_0_online_subsequent](../includes/pn-crm-8-1-0-online-subsequent.md)] and Dynamics 365 Service Pack 1 (on-premises).  
  
<a name="EnableSLAs"></a>   
## Enable entities for applying SLAs  
 To apply SLAs to an entity, you must set the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Metadata.EntityMetadata.IsSLAEnabled> attribute to true for the entity. You can’t change this setting after it’s been enabled. By default, the `Incident` entity is enabled for SLAs.  
  
 You can also use the customization tool to enable entities for SLAs. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Enable entities for service level agreements](../customer-service/enable-entities-service-level-agreements.md)  
  
 After you have enabled an entity forSLAs, new SLA-related attributes, such as `SLAId` and `SLAInvokedId`, will be automatically added to the entity.  
  
<a name="CreateSLAKPI"></a>   
## Create SLA KPIs  
 To programmatically create SLA KPIs for an entity, create a lookup attribute on any SLA-enabled entity, and then set a relationship for that attribute to the `SLAKPIInstance` entity.  
  
<a name="ApplySLA"></a>   
## Apply SLAs to entity records  
 Using the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] web client, you can create SLAs for an SLA-enabled entity, and set an SLA as default for the entity so that it is applied automatically to any new entity records.  
  
 However, if you want to manually apply SLAs to entity records based on any custom business requirement, you can programmatically update the entity record to set the `SLAId` attribute value to the desired active SLA record.  
  
<a name="Limitations"></a>   
## Limitations to applying SLAs in Dynamics 365 (online)  
 In [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)], the following limitations are applicable for SLAs per [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] instance (organization):  
  
- You can have a maximum of 7 entities that can have active SLAs. You will encounter an error on activating an SLA if this limit is exceeded.  
  
- You can have a maximum of 5 SLA KPIs per entity for active SLAs. You will encounter an error on activating an SLA if this limit is exceeded. This limit is not applicable for the `Incident` entity.  
  
  These limits aren't applicable for [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] on-premises.
