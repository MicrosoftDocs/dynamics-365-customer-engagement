# Application platform for building extended xRM applications

[!INCLUDE[](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

[!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)] Customer Engagement offers customers, partners, independent software vendors (ISVs), and systems integrators (SIs), a powerful platform for building line-of-business applications. These applications are often referred to as *Extended Dynamics 365* applications (*xRM*) applications because they leverage the relationship tracking capabilities beyond the typical customer relationship management (CRM) scenarios. These applications span across various industries including [Retail](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics/retail.aspx), [Service industries](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics/service-industries.aspx), [Manufacturing](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics/manufacturing.aspx), [Distribution](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics/distribution), [Financial services](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics/crm-financial-services.aspx), and [Public sector](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics/public-sector.aspx).  
  
 Dynamics 365 includes additional capabilities for Operations and Financials. For developer documentation using these capabilities, see:  
  
-   [Dynamics 365 Operations developer documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/)  
  
-   [Dynamics 365 Financials developer documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/)  
  
## What does xRM mean for a developer?  
 Business applications typically model and track connections between various types of business data (people, places, and things). [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] provides for declarative development of relational business applications with flexible data models and dynamic services. In addition to  the declarative application capabilities, business applications built on [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] can be extended and integrated with external systems through a rich Software Development Kit (SDK).  
  
### Rapid application development  
 These days there is little time to write a lot of custom code to deliver solutions. To meet requirements for business applications you need a framework that provides the agility and flexibility to rapidly adapt to changes and get user acceptance and adoption.  
  
### You get a user interface ready for international use  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] provides a user experience optimized for interacting with relational data. Users can navigate to, view, edit, report, and take action on their data using modern web and mobile applications available on iOS, [!INCLUDE[tn_android](../includes/tn-android.md)], and Windows. These applications have the ability to guide users through a business process and rules from start to finish. This user experience provides a common and consistent interaction model for a user who uses multiple business applications.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] application supports many international languages and currencies. Your application inherits all these capabilities.  
  
### You get an extensible data and security model  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] enables you to extend the out-of-the-box data model to meet the data storage and tracking needs of your business application. You can disable elements of this data model if they don’t apply to your business application. The data model is protected by an extensible security model to apply role, record and field level, as well as hierarchical security. All other aspects of the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] platform and user experience are driven by the data and security model you define. In this way, users only see and have access to the data and actions you choose.  
  
 Organizations can also add their own data elements and security to work seamlessly on top of the data model used by your application. Or other ISVs or SIs can build solutions on top of yours, just as yours is built on top of the default [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] data and security model.  
  
### You get extensible business logic  
 Defining and enforcing consistent business processes is one of the main reasons people use [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)]. You can use [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] to define and enforce consistent business processes and rules for your application.  
  
 Organizations that use your application can modify or extend your default application business logic without writing code.  
  
### You get [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Office_365](../includes/pn-ms-office-365.md)] integration  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] provides so many additional options to work with your application. With your application people will be able to:  
  
- Integrate with [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] for email tracking, scheduling and task management.  
  
- Initiate instant messaging and phone calls with [!INCLUDE[pn_skype_for_business](../includes/pn-skype-for-business.md)].  
  
- Use [!INCLUDE[pn_power_bi_for_office_365_short](../includes/pn-power-bi-for-office-365-short.md)] to analyze data.  
  
- Edit data with [!INCLUDE[pn_Excel_short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)].  
  
- Take rich contextual notes with [!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)].  
  
- Create personalized documents as a team with automatic document generation and real-time co-authoring.  
  
- Manage contextual documents across [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)], [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_groups](../includes/pn-office-365-groups.md)], and [!INCLUDE[pn_onedrive_for_business](../includes/pn-onedrive-for-business.md)].  
  
- Get relevant content with [!INCLUDE[pn_office_delve](../includes/pn-office-delve.md)] based on what they're working on and who they're working with.  
  
### You get cross-platform mobile applications  
 The [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] mobile apps download metadata about your data model, security configuration, business processes and rules, transforming the out-of-the-box experience into a customized mobile app for your application.  
  
### You get business intelligence  
 People using your application will be able to gain insight into your business and proactively anticipate business needs.  
  
 They will be able to use [!INCLUDE[pn_power_bi_for_office_365_short](../includes/pn-power-bi-for-office-365-short.md)], interactive dashboards and reports, advanced visualizations, and natural language Q&A. People will have visibility into business performance with at-a-glance dashboards and contextual charts inside your business application.  
  
### You can build on top of the platform  
 The web services built into [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] allow developers familiar with standards based web technologies to extend and integrate their business applications built on [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] using HTML, [!INCLUDE[pn_JavaScript](../includes/pn-javascript.md)], and CSS, and the [!INCLUDE[pn_NET_Framework](../includes/pn-net-framework.md)]. [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] exposes the same end user and administrative capabilities you've seen in the UI through a RESTful web service API built on open standards including OAuth 2.0 and OData v4. Because [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] embraces web standards, external systems can integrate with your business application built on [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] using their platform and languages of choice.
