# Product pricing methods

[!INCLUDE[](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

[!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] uses the `ProductPriceLevel.PricingMethodCode` attribute to determine prices. The value of this attribute affects:  
  
- How the price for the product is determined for each unit of measure that is defined for that product.  
  
- What attributes are required when you create or update a product price level and its associated product.  
  
  You can also use custom pricing for products instead of using the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] system pricing. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Use custom pricing for products](use-custom-pricing-products.md)  
  
  The following table lists the formulas that are used for each value and the attributes that are required by each value.

However, if you use the `Currency Amount` pricing method to determine a price, this attribute is platform required and you must specify a value for this attribute.                                                                                                                  |

This is the **List Price** in the **Product** form.<br />-   `ProductPriceLevel.Percentage` attribute. This is the desired percentage of the list price.<br />-   `ProductPriceLevel.RoundingPolicyCode` attribute. This is the policy for rounding the price list.                                                                                                                    |

You must update this cost every time that you receive a shipment of the item.<br />-   `ProductPriceLevel.Percentage` attribute. This is the percent markup.<br />-   `ProductPriceLevel.RoundingPolicyCode` attribute.                                                                                                                                     |

This is the profit percentage you want to achieve.<br />-   `ProductPriceLevel.RoundingPolicyCode` attribute.                                                                                            |
| **Percent Markup - Standard Cost** <br />MarkupStandardCost = 5 |                                         The price is calculated as a percentage of the standard cost of the item. <br />calculated price = standard cost x 100% + percentage <br />Because the standard cost is updated periodically, the standard cost amount in this equation is an average and will not always be the same as the amount you paid most recently for the item.<br /><br /> For each unit of measure for each product, you must enter data for the following attributes:<br /><br /> -   `Product.StandardCost` attribute. Every time that you update the standard cost, the price changes.<br />-   `ProductPriceLevel.Percentage` attribute. This is the percent markup.<br />-   `ProductPriceLevel.RoundingPolicyCode` attribute.                                         |

 To set the values for the `ProductPriceLevel.PricingMethodCode` attribute and the other product price level entity attributes, use the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.Update*> method, passing an instance of the `ProductPriceLevel` class. To set the values for the product attributes, use the methods in the `Product` class.
