# ViewSelector methods (Client API reference)

[!INCLUDE[](../../../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Provides methods to get or set information about the view selector of the subgrid control. If the subgrid control is not configured to display the view selector, calling the **ViewSelector** methods will throw an error.

ViewSelector is available only for read-only grids. ViewSelector is returned by the **gridContext**.[getViewSelector](gridcontrol/getViewSelector.md) method.

```JavaScript
var viewSelector = gridContext.getViewSelector();
```
