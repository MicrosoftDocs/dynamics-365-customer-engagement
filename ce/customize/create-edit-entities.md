# Create or edit entities (record types) 

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc-applies-to-powerapps-and-update-9-0-0.md)]

Entities define the types of records people can use in a Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement app or a [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] organization. In Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement, you can edit customizable system entities and create, edit, and delete custom entities.
