# Create or edit entities (record types) 

[!INCLUDE [cc_applies_to_on-prem-9_0_0](../includes/cc_applies_to_on-prem-9_0_0.md)]

Entities define the types of records people can use in Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps or a [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps organization. In Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps, you can edit customizable system entities and create, edit, and delete custom entities.
