# Overview of the form editor user interface

[!INCLUDE [cc-applies-to-powerapps-and-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc-applies-to-powerapps-and-update-9-0-0.md)]

The form editor displays commands in three tabs: **File**, **Home**, and **Insert**. More information: 

- [File tab](#file-tab)
- [Home tab](#home-tab)
- [Insert tab](#insert-tab)

The form editor is divided into three areas: **Navigation**, **Body**, and **Explorer**.  

![Form editor user interface](media/form-user-interface.png)

**Navigation**  
Located on the left side, use the navigation area to control access to related entities or to add links to URLs to be displayed in the main pane of the form. To edit navigation, you must first select the **Navigation** command in the **Select** group of the **Home** tab.

Main forms provide navigation options through the navigation bar, but use the same data in the navigation area to control what navigation options are available. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Edit Navigation](../customize/use-the-form-editor-legacy.md)  


**Body** <br>
Located in the center, use the body area to control the layout of the form. You can select and drag form elements to position them. Double-clicking on an element will open the properties for the element. 

By default, for the Case, Contact, and Account Main forms, the first section under the **Summary** tab shows the account or contact card form of type **Quick View**. For custom entities, this section is not available by default. You can insert a new section and a quick view form in it. The card form shows a maximum of five fields. Other than fields, it isn’t possible to show other controls in the Blue tile even if the quick view form contains it. 

>[!NOTE] 
> To preserve the card format (as shown in the following image), we recommend that you do not move the quick view form to any other section on the form.

 [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Create and edit quick view forms](../customize/create-edit-quick-view-forms.md)  

-   To add a field, select it from the **Field Explorer** and drag it into a section.  

    -   To add an element that is not a field, select where you want to place it and use the appropriate command from the **Insert** tab add it.  

    -   To remove an element, select it and use the **Remove** command in the **Edit** group of the **Home** tab.  

    -   To edit the **Header** or **Footer** for the form you must first select the corresponding command in the **Select** group of the **Home** tab.  

**Explorer**  
Located on the right side, the content of the explorer area depends on the context.  

When you select **Body**, **Header**, or **Footer** in the **Select** group of the **Home** tab, you’ll see the **Field Explorer**. Use the **Field Explorer** to drag fields you want to display into a section in the form or within the header or footer. You can include the same field multiple times in a form. Use the **New Field** button as a shortcut to create a new field.  

When you select **Navigation** in the **Select** group of the **Home** tab you’ll see the **Relationship Explorer**. Drag any of the relationships into one of the groups within the navigation area. You cannot add the same relationship twice. Relationships are available based on how they are configured. If you configure a relationship to not display, it won’t display in the **Relationship Explorer**. For information about how to configure default display options for relationships, see [Navigation pane item for primary entity](create-and-edit-1n-relationships.md#navigation-pane-item-for-primary-entity).

You can use the **New 1:N** and **New N:N buttons** as a shortcut to add new entity relationships.
