# Create or edit dashboards

[!INCLUDE [cc-applies-to-powerapps-and-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc-applies-to-powerapps-and-update-9-0-0.md)] 

There are two types of dashboards, user dashboards and system dashboards. Any user can create a dashboard visible only to them in their work area such as Sales, Service, or Marketing. An admin or customizer creates or customizes system dashboards that, when published, are visible to everyone in the organization. A user can choose to set their user dashboard as their default dashboard and override the system dashboard. This topic focuses on system dashboards.

## Create a new dashboard  
  
1.  Open solution explorer, and then select **Components** > **Dashboards**.  
  
2.  Select **New**, choose a layout, and then select **Create**.  
  
3.  In the **Dashboard: New** dialog box enter a name for the dashboard.  
  
4.  Select one of the component areas and then select the icon for a chart or a list.  
  
     You can have up to six components in the dashboard.  
  
5.  For example, to add a chart, in the **Add Component** dialog box, select values for **Record Type**, **View**, and **Chart**, and then select **Add** to add the chart to the dashboard.  
  
6.  When you are finished adding components to your dashboard, select **Save** and then **Publish**.
