# Virtual entity walkthrough using the OData v4 Data Provider

[!INCLUDE [cc-applies-to-powerapps-and-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc-applies-to-powerapps-and-update-9-0-0.md)]

## About this virtual entity walkthrough

Imagine that you want to access ticket information from an external data source within your model-driven app or the Service area of [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] for Customer Engagement. In this simple walkthrough, you'll model a virtual entity with fields mapped to the external schema that retrieves ticket data at runtime from an OData web service.

## Data source details

Because the data source used for this walkthrough has an OData v4 web service, we can use the OData v4 Data Provider included with your environment.

Web service url: http://contosowebservice.azurewebsites.net/odata/ 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The web service url used for this walkthrough isn't a functioning web service.

For this walkthrough, a single virtual entity that contains the following three fields is needed.

|External field name |External data type |Virtual entity data type |Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|TicketID |Edm.Guid |Primary key |Primary key for the entity |
|Title  |Edm.String |Single Line of Text |Title of the ticket |
|Severity |Edm.Int32 | Whole Number |Number value of 0-4 indicating the severity of the ticket |

## Create the Data Source

Create the data source for the OData v4 data provider that uses the OASIS Open Data Protocol (OData) sample web service.

Go to **Settings** > **Administration** > **Virtual Entity Data Sources**.

Select **NEW**, select **OData v4 Data Provider**, and then select **OK**.

Enter or select the following information.

- **Name**: Contoso Sample Data Source
- **URL**: http://contosowebservice.azurewebsites.net/odata 
- **Timeout**: 30
- **Return Inline Count**: True

Leave the other fields as-is, and select **SAVE & CLOSE**.

> [!TIP]
> When using your own web service, verify that the URL is valid by pasting it in to your web browser. 

## Create the virtual entity

Go to **Settings** > **Customizations** > **Customize the System**.

In the left navigation pane, select **Entities**, and then select **New** from the main pane.

On the **Entity: New** form, select the **Virtual Entity** option, and then enter the following information: 

- Data Source: Contoso Sample Data Source
- Display Name: Ticket
- Plural Name: Tickets
- Name: new_ticket
- External Name: Ticket
- External Collection Name: Tickets
- Select to enable the following Communication & Collaboration options:

> 
> A Nullable value of false indicates that the attribute is required. Notice that primary key fields are always system required.
