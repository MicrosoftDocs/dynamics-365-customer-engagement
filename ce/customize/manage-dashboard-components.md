# Manage dashboard components

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

You can create and design dashboards to show the information that you want exactly how you want to see it. While designing the dashboard, you can rearrange or remove the components that you have already added and change the height and width of a component.  
  
 By default, you can add only six components to any dashboard layout. This limit is configurable. For more information, contact your system administrator.  
  
1.  Go to your work area.  
  
2.  Do one of the following:  
  
    -   In the web app: Click **Dashboards**.  
  
    -   In Dynamics 365 for Outlook: Click **My Work** > **Dashboards**.  
  
3.  Click **New**.  
  
4.  As youâ€™re creating your dashboard, to undo the last action, click or tap **Undo**. To repeat an action, click **Redo**.  
  
5.  To rearrange the components, click the component header and drag it to an empty area on the dashboard or to the area of an existing component. When you drag a component over other components, a red line appears on top of the components to show that if you drop the component here, the existing component will move down.  
  
6.  To change the width of a component, select the component, click the **More Commands** icon ![More Commands button in Appointment Activity](../customize/media/morecommands.gif "More Commands button in Appointment Activity") and click **Increase Width** or **Decrease Width**. The width increases or decreases by one column.  
  
7.  To change the height of a component, click **Increase Height** or **Decrease Height**. The height increases or decreases by three rows.  
  
8.  To remove a component, select it and click **Remove**. When you remove a component, any new components are added in the bottom area of the designer. You can rearrange the components at any time after you insert them.
