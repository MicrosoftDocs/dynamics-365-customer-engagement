# Monitor and manage workflow processes

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

To monitor and manage processes, you must locate the process, evaluate the status, and perform any actions necessary to address problems.  
  
<a name="BKMK_MonitorAsyncWorkflows"></a>   
## Monitoring background workflows  
 Background workflows generate System Job records to track their status. You can access information about these system jobs in several places within the application:  
  
 **Settings > System Jobs**  
 This will include all types of system jobs. You will need to filter records to those where **System Job Type** is **Workflow**.  
  
 **From the Workflow Process**  
 Open the background workflow definition and go to the **Process Session** tab. This will show only the system jobs for this background workflow.  
  
 **From the record**  
 You can edit the entity form so that the navigation will include the **Background Processes** relationship. This will show all the system jobs that have been started in the context of the record.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If an asynchronous system job (workflow) fails several times consecutively, [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] starts to postpone execution of that job for longer and longer time intervals to allow the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] administrator to investigate and resolve the issue. Once the job starts succeeding again, it will resume executing normally.  
  
<a name="BKMK_ActionsOnRunningWorkflows"></a>   
### Actions on running background workflows  
 While a background workflow is running, you have options to **Cancel**, **Pause**, or **Postpone** the workflow. If you have previously paused a workflow, you can **Resume** it.  
  
<a name="BKMK_MonitorSyncWorkflows"></a>   
## Monitoring real-time workflows and actions  
 Real-time workflows and actions do not use System Job records because they occur immediately. Any errors that occur will be displayed to the user in the application with the heading **Business Process Error**.  
  
 There is no log for successful operations. You can enable logging for errors by checking the **Keep Logs for workflow jobs that encountered errors** option in the **Workflow Log Retention** area at the bottom of the **Administration** tab for the process.  
  
 To view the log of errors for a specific process, open the real-time workflow or action definition and go to the **Process Session** tab. This will only show any errors logged for this process.  
  
 If you want a view of all the errors for any process, go to **Advanced Find** and create a view showing errors on the process session entity.  
  
<a name="BKMK_StatusOfWorkflowProcesses"></a>   
## Status of workflow processes  
 When you view a list of workflow processes, any individual process can have one of the following **State** and **Status Reason** values:  
  
|State|Status Reason|  
|-----------|-------------------|  
|Ready|Waiting for Resources|  
|Suspended|Waiting|  
|Locked|In Progress<br /><br /> Pausing<br /><br /> Canceling|  
|Completed|Succeeded<br /><br /> Failed<br /><br /> Canceled|
