# Configure Bing maps

[!INCLUDE [cc-applies-to-powerapps-and-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc-applies-to-powerapps-and-update-9-0-0.md)]

 Bing Maps can be displayed on a form for the account, contact, lead, quote, order, invoice, competitor, and system user entities. You can remove the Bing Maps area in the form editor or add it back by using the **Bing Maps** button on the **Insert** tab of the form editor.  

 To enable Bing Maps the system setting **Show Bing Maps on forms** must be enabled.
