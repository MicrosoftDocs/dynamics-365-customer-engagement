# Common field properties

[!INCLUDE [cc-applies-to-powerapps-and-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc-applies-to-powerapps-and-update-9-0-0.md)]

 Fields in a form display controls people use to view or edit data in an entity record. Fields can be formatted to occupy up to four columns within a section.  

You can access **Common field properties** in solution explorer. Under **Components**, expand **Entities**, expand the entity you want, and then select **Forms**. In the list of forms, open the form of type **Main**. Then double-click one of the fields to view Common field properties.

The following table describes properties that all fields have. Certain types of fields have special properties. These are described in [Special field properties](../customize/special-field-properties-legacy.md).  


|        Tab         |                       Property                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

This will prevent any configuration you have applied to the field, such as event handlers, from being cleared if the field were removed. To remove this field a customizer would need to clear this setting first.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

|    **Details**     |    **Display Name**, **Name**, and **Description**    | These read-only fields are for reference. Click the **Edit** button for convenient access to the field definition if you want to edit it.<br /><br /> Each instance of a field in the form has a name property so that they can be referenced in form scripts, but this name is managed by the application. The first instance of the field is the name of the field specified when it was created. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Create and edit fields](create-edit-fields.md#create-and-edit-fields)<br /><br /> For each additional time that a field is included in a form, the name appends a number starting with 1 to the end. So if the field name is ‘new_cost’, the first instance is ‘new_cost’, the second is ‘new_cost1’, and so on for each instance of the field in the form.<br /><br />**Note:** The field **Description** value provides tooltip text for the field when people place their cursor over it. |
