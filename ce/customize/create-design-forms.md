# Create and design forms 

[!INCLUDE [cc-applies-to-powerapps-and-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc-applies-to-powerapps-and-update-9-0-0.md)]

With [!INCLUDE [pn-powerapps](../includes/pn-powerapps.md)], forms provide the user interface that people use to interact with the data they need to do their work. It's important that the forms people use are designed to allow them to find or enter the information they need efficiently. 

In the default solution or an unmanaged solution, you can create new forms or edit existing forms for all entities that allow form customization. 
In an unmanaged solution, you can edit the managed properties for an unmanaged custom entity that was created for the solution.
If you’re viewing a managed solution, you can’t create new forms or edit existing forms for entities. However, if the managed properties for an entity in the managed solution are set to allow customization, you can add or edit forms to that entity.

## Type of forms
There are several types of forms:  

|    Form type     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                     More information                                     |

This simplified form is designed to be used for mobile devices.                                                                                                                                                          |           [Customize the mobile app](../customize/customize-phones-tablets.md)           |

While each form type has specific needs, when working with forms you use the Form Editor. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Work with the form editor](work-with-form-editor.md)

## Updated versus classic entities  
[!INCLUDE [pn-powerapps](../includes/pn-powerapps.md)] provides many options for designing forms. With Unified Interface, most entities were updated to better suit the responsive interface. Updated entities as well as your own custom entities include support for the [!INCLUDE[pn_moca_full](../includes/pn-moca-full.md)] client, business process flows, and business rules. When you use these entities, you can design once and deploy to all clients.  

There are still a number of entities, referred to here as classic entities, that retain the appearance and capabilities from earlier versions. These entities are used less often. They are listed here:
