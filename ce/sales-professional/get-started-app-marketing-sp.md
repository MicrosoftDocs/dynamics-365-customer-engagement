# Get started with in-app marketing (Sales Professional)

Promote your business and improve sales with targeted marketing campaigns in [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] Professional. Create activities for each campaign and assign them to different team members. Track customer response and costs for each campaign. Follow this step-by-step guide to get started with your marketing campaigns.  
  
## Import contacts, accounts, and leads  
 Get your customer records into [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)], and add these to marketing lists so you can target your campaigns. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Import data](/power-platform/admin/import-data-all-record-types)  
  
## Create marketing lists  
 Group accounts, contacts, or leads into a targeted marketing list. You can create a marketing list easily with the search functionality in [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)], so you find all of your customers in a particular area, for example, and add them to the member list.

## Understand the difference between a campaign and a quick campaign  
 In the marketing area, use standard campaigns to manage the end-to-end process of a complete marketing campaign, like managing campaign and planning activities, distributing the activities to other team members, and tracking how the campaign did. Campaigns include extensive tracking features, including detailed information, reports, and multiple marketing lists.  
  
 In contrast to standard campaigns, use quick campaigns to automatically distribute a single activity to selected accounts, contacts, or leads, or to a single marketing list. The effects of a quick campaign are immediate.
