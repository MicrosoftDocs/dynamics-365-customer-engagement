# Export data or template in Dynamics 365 Sales Professional

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This capability is introduced in the Dynamics 365 Sales Professional app version 9.1.0.0.

Present sales-related information to someone who doesn’t have access to the Sales Professional app by exporting the data to a Microsoft Excel static worksheet.

You can export just the data from a list to an Excel static file, or you can export a template.

When you export a template, a ready-made worksheet with column headings matching to that of the fields of the record is created for you. The Excel template can be used to seamlessly import records into the Sales app.

## Where do I find the export options?

You can export data and templates from the Advanced Settings.

When you export data or a template, you must select the entity you want to export the data or template for, such as Lead or Opportunity. 

You can also choose the view that will be used for exporting. If you don’t choose a view, the default view is selected, and the data or template for all the columns in that view is exported.
