# Set up enhanced email (Sales Professional)

Before sales reps can use enhanced email, you must enable it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The enhanced email experience is available only for email activities created from the **Timeline** section of any model-driven app. 


To enable enhanced email:

1. In your app, select the **Settings** icon, and then select **Advanced Settings**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![Advanced Settings link in the site map](../sales-enterprise/media/advanced-settings-option.png "Advanced Settings link in the site map")

    The **Business Management settings** page opens in a new browser tab.

2. On the navigation bar, select **Settings** > **Administration**.

3. Select **System Settings**.

4. On the **Email** tab of **System Settings** dialog box, select the **Multitask, compose, and save drafts, using email pop-up windows, when creating email from timeline** check box. 

4. Select **OK**.
