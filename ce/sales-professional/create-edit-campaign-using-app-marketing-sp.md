# Create or edit a campaign using in-app marketing (Sales Professional)

Promote your business, expand your reach to new customers, and improve sales by using campaigns in [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)].

- Budgets and expenses  
  
- Promotion codes  
  
- Target products  
  
- Marketing collateral, including sales literature
