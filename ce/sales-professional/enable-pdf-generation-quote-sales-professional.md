# Enable or disable PDF generation from sales records

The PDF generation capability allows your users to generate PDF documents directly from sales records. The capability to create PDF documents is supported on the following entities: Accounts, Contacts, Leads, Opportunities, Quotes, Orders, and Invoices. You can select the entities on which you want to enable PDF generation.

1.	In the site map, under **Setup**, select **Sales settings**.

2.	Under **Advanced settings**, select **PDF generation**.

3.	To enable or disable PDF generation, on the **Generate PDF file** page, under **Select whether PDF files can be created, saved, and emailed based on Dynamics 365 Sales entity records**, set the entity toggle to **Enabled** or **Disabled**. For example, if you want to enable PDF generation on **Opportunity** records, set the Opportunity toggle to **Enabled**.
