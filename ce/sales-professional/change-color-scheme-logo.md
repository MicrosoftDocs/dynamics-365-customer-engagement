# Set up branding and theming for your organization

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This capability is introduced in the Dynamics 365 Sales Professional app version 9.1.0.0.

Change the color scheme of the user interface based on your preference or create your own branding by changing the color scheme or logo in Dynamics 365 Sales
Professional. You can create a custom look and feel (a theme) for Sales Professional app and Dynamics 365 for Phones app by using new colors and visual elements.

The theme colors are applied globally throughout the application. For example, you can enhance the following visual elements in the UI:

-   Product logos

-   Background color for the navigation bar (defined by **Nav Bar color**)

-   Color for the command bar, buttons, and tabs (defined by **Main Color**)

-   Color for the process bar (defined by **Accent Color**)

The theme that you are currently using is shown with the text “currently applied”.
