# Export data or template in [!INCLUDE[pn-sales-business-doc-name](../includes/pn-sales-business-doc-name.md)], Preview

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0.md)]

[!INCLUDE[Pre-release disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Present the sales related information to an individual who doesn’t have access to the Sales app by exporting the data to a [!INCLUDE[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] Office [!INCLUDE[pn-excel-short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)] static worksheet.

You can export just the data from a list to an [!INCLUDE[pn-excel-short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)] static file, or you can export a template.

When you export a template, a readymade worksheet with column headings matching to that of the fields of the record is created for you. The [!INCLUDE[pn-excel-short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)] template can be used to seamlessly import records into the Sales app.

## Where do I find the export options?

Data and template can be exported from:

-   List of records

-   Advanced Settings

When you export data or template from **Advanced Settings**, you must select the entity you want to export the data or template for, such as Lead or Opportunity. You may also choose the view that will be used for exporting. If you don’t choose a view, the default view is selected and the data or template for all the columns in that view is exported.
