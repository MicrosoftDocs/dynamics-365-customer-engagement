# Set personal options in [!INCLUDE[pn-sales-business-doc-name](../includes/pn-sales-business-doc-name.md)], Preview

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0.md)]

[!INCLUDE[Pre-release disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Personalize your [!INCLUDE[pn-sales-business-doc-name](../includes/pn-sales-business-doc-name.md)], Preview workspace to suit your requirements or preferences. For example, personalize how you want to see your calendar or set the time zone you work in.

| **Options**         | **Description**           |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| **Time Zone**       |                           |
| Set the time zone you are in    | Select the time zone that you want to display for your region. **Note:** If you use [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] for Outlook, set the same time zone in [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] to help prevent a mismatch in dates and times.|
| **Calendar**        |                           |
| Set Calendar Default View      | Select whether you want to view your calendar for Day, Week, or Month. By default, your calendar default view is set to Day. This means that you’ll see the scheduled meetings or events for the day. |
| Set Default Work Hours    | If you have non-traditional work schedule, select the start and end time of your work hours to define your working times. By default it is set to Start Time – 8:00 am and End Time – 5:00 pm.        |
| **Set the number of records shown per page in any list of records**   |          |
| Records Per Page    | Select the maximum number of records you want to see in a list on a page. You can set a value from 50 to 250.    |
