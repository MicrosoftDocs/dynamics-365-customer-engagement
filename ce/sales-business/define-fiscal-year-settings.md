3.  Type information in the text boxes.

    -   In the **Start Date** box, select the date to start the fiscal year.

    -   In the **Fiscal Period Template** drop-down list, select how your fiscal year is divided.

    -   In the **Fiscal Year** drop-down list, select how you want to display the fiscal year.

    -   In the **Fiscal Period** drop-down list, select how you want to display the fiscal period.
