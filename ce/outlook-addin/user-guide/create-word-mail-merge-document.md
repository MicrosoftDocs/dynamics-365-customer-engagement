# Create a Microsoft Word mail-merge document with Dynamics 365 for Outlook
You can use [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_dynamics_crm_for_outlook](../../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-for-outlook.md)] with [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Word_Full](../../includes/pn-ms-word-full.md)] to create documents for your customers that display [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] data.  
  
 With mail merge, you can:  
  
-   Create new templates or use an existing template to generate form letters for yourself or, with the appropriate permissions, for the whole organization.  
  
-   Send form letters or form email messages to contacts, accounts, or marketing mailing lists.  
  
-   Resend old letters to new recipients.  
  
-   Create faxes.  
  
-   Create quotes.  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)], only one mail merge can be run at a time. If you receive the message "[!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] Mail Merge is already running" and want to discontinue a mail merge, close and then reopen [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Word_Full](../../includes/pn-ms-word-full.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_Internet_Explorer](../../includes/pn-internet-explorer.md)].  
  
 To use mail merge, your email format must be HTML.  
  
 Record types that use mail merge:  
  
-   Account  
  
-   Campaign  
  
     To use mail merge with a campaign, you must first distribute a mail campaign activity to a selected marketing list.  
  
-   Contact  
  
-   Lead  
  
-   Opportunity  
  
-   List Member in Marketing List  
  
-   Quick Campaign  
  
     In [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)], you can create a mail merge, and then at the end of the process, create a quick campaign.  
  
-   Quote  
  
     With mail merge, you can print only one quote at a time.  
  
### Create a mail merge document  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)], open the list of records you want.  
  
    > [!TIP]
    >  This list can be the results of an [Advanced Find search](../../basics/save-advanced-find-search.md).  
  
2.  In the list, select the record you want to add to the mail-merge recipient list.  
  
3.  On the **Add** tab, in the **Marketing** group, click or tap **Mail Merge**.  
  
4.  If you have other languages installed, you can select a language to filter the list of templates.  
  
     In the **Mail Merge** dialog box, select the type of document you want to use.  
  
5.  Choose whether you want to start with a blank document or a template. If you select a template option, click or tap the **Lookup** button ![Lookup button](../media/lookup-button-4.gif "Lookup button") to select a template.  
  
     New mail merge templates are created in the Settings area. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Work with mail merge templates](../../admin/work-mail-merge-templates.md)
  
6.  If necessary, you can add or delete data fields.  
  
     [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Word_Full](../../includes/pn-ms-word-full.md)] supports up to 62 data fields, of which  [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] reserves two data fields to store the primary key and the record owner.  
  
7.  Click or tap **Download**.  
  
     [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] automatically opens a  [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Word_short](../../includes/pn-ms-word-short.md)] document. You may need to select [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Word_Full](../../includes/pn-ms-word-full.md)] in the task bar.  
  
     This is not your mail-merge document. This is an interim page.  
  
8.  In the **Mail Merge Recipient** dialog box, verify that the list is accurate, and then click or tap **OK**.  
  
9. To continue the mail merge, follow the instructions provided by the Mail Merge pane. For more information, see the [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Word_Full](../../includes/pn-ms-word-full.md)] Help documentation for mail merge.  
  
    > [!TIP]
    > -   To display the information you want and select the format, in the Mail Merge wizard, click or tap **Address Block** and then **Greeting Line**.  
    > -   To add data fields to display more information, click or tap **More Items**. You can use up to 62 data fields.  
  
10. If you have either created a new template or updated an existing template, you can upload the template.  
  
    -   To save the document as a template, on the **Complete the merge** pane, click or tap **Upload Template to Dynamics 365**.  
  
11. If you have saved the document as a template, you can go back and edit the template with **Settings** > **Business** > **Templates**. Click or tap your template to review and edit it.
