      [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] installs [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)]. You may need to restart your computer to complete the installation.  
  
5. On the final page of the wizard, click **Close**.  
  
### Step 3: Configure Dynamics 365 for Outlook  
 You must configure [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] after installing it. When you restart [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] after installing, the Configuration Wizard starts automatically.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If the Configuration Wizard doesn’t start automatically, in the Start screen, search for **Configuration Wizard** and run it. In earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Windows_short](../../includes/pn-ms-windows-short.md)], click **Start > All Programs > Microsoft Dynamics 365**, and then click **Configuration Wizard**.  
  
1. In the Configuration Wizard, you’ll see a **Server URL** drop-down list. Click the arrow next to the drop-down list, and then do one of the following:  
  
   - To connect to a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] organization, select **Dynamics 365 (online)**. If you don’t know if you’re using the online or on-premises version of [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], look in your browser at the web address for [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]. If the web address contains “dynamics.com” after the name of your organization, you’re using the online version. Otherwise, it’s the on-premises version.  
  
   - To connect to a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_2013_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-2013-shortest.md)] (on-premises) organization, there are two types of URLs, depending on whether your computer is connected to the Internet or not:  
  
     - For internal deployments (not connected over the Internet), type the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] server or discovery service URL using the following format: **<http://crmserver>** or **<http://crmserver:5555>**.  
  
     - To connect over the Internet, use the discovery service URL using the following format: **https://dev.crmserver.contoso.com**.  
  
       > [!NOTE]
       >  If you’re unsure of what url to use, check with your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] administrator.

2. Click **Test Connection**. This adds organizations to the **Organization Information** list. If you’re prompted for credentials, select from the following options:  
  
   - For a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] organization, do one of the following:  
  
     - If your organization connects through [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../../includes/pn-office-365.md)], enter your [!INCLUDE[cc_Microsoft](../../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] online services user name and password, and then click **OK**. This information was sent to you in email when your account was created.  
  
     - If you’re connecting with an earlier online services platform, enter your [!INCLUDE[cc_Microsoft](../../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] account (formerly [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Windows_short](../../includes/pn-ms-windows-short.md)] Live ID) and password, and then click **OK**. This information was sent to you in email when your account was created.  
  
   - For a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] on-premises organization, you may not be prompted because [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] uses your [!INCLUDE[pn_Active_Directory](../../includes/pn-active-directory.md)] domain credentials.  
  
3. In the **Organization** list, select the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] organization you want to connect to, and then click **OK**. Then click **Close**.
