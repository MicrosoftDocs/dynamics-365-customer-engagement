# The Outlook email address should be the same as the Dynamics 365 email address
You’re seeing the following error message:  
  
 **“To track emails and perform synchronization, your Outlook email address should be the same as your email address in Microsoft Dynamics 365.”**  
  
 This message is common when you have multiple [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Outlook_Full](../../includes/pn-ms-outlook-full.md)] email addresses or have access to more than one [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] organization. For example, your company may use multiple [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] organizations for testing or upgrade purposes.  
  
 You may also see this error message if you are configuring [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_dynamics_crm_for_outlook](../../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-for-outlook.md)], but you don’t have an [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] email address, or you haven’t set the primary email address field in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)].  
  
 To fix this, start by finding the primary Outlook email address:  
  
## Find the primary Outlook email address  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)], choose **File**.  
  
2.  Under **Account Information**, choose **Account Settings**, and then select **Account Settings** from the list.  
  
     In the **Account Settings** dialog box, you’ll see a check mark next to the primary email address. Make a note of the exact address.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >  You must use the exact email address that you see in the **Account Settings** dialog box. For example, the following email addresses are not equivalent:  
    >   
    >  nanderson@contoso.com  
    >   
    >  nancy.anderson@contoso.com  
  
 Then, pick **one** of the following methods.  
  
## Change the email address in Dynamics 365 to match the Outlook address  
  
1.  [!INCLUDE[proc_permissions_system_admin_and_customizer](../../includes/proc-permissions-system-admin-and-customizer.md)]  
  
    #### Check your security role  
  
    1.  [!INCLUDE[proc_follow_steps_in_link](../../includes/proc-follow-steps-in-link.md)]  
  
    2.  [!INCLUDE[proc_dont_have_correct_permissions](../../includes/proc-dont-have-correct-permissions.md)]  
  
2.  [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_security](../../includes/proc-settings-security.md)]  
  
3.  Choose **Users**.  
  
4.  Under **Enabled Users**, choose a user.  
  
5.  In the **Primary Email** field, enter the [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] email address. Make sure you use the primary [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] email address. Most people have just one [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] email address. This should probably be a company email address and not a personal email address.  
  
6.  Save the changes.  
  
## Change the email address in Outlook to match the address in Dynamics 365  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)], choose the **File** menu.  
  
2.  Under **Account Information**, choose **Add Account**, and then enter the account information.  
  
3.  Restart [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)].  
  
 You’ll need to set the new email account to be the default account.  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)], choose the **File** menu.  
  
2.  Under **Account Information**, choose **Account Settings > Account Settings…**  
  
3.  Select the new account, and then choose **Set as Default**.  
  
4.  Choose **Close**.
