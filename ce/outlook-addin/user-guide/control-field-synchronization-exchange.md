# Control field synchronization between Dynamics 365 apps and Outlook or Exchange
If you’re a system administrator, you can control synchronization of appointments, contacts, and tasks fields between [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] (using [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)]) or [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../../includes/pn-exchange.md)] (using [!INCLUDE[cc_server_side_synch](../../includes/cc-server-side-synch.md)]). You can:  
  
- View and modify the fields that are synchronized between [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../../includes/pn-exchange.md)].  
  
- Control whether a specific pair of fields is synchronized:  
  
  - In one direction - from [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../../includes/pn-exchange.md)] to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] **or** from [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] to [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../../includes/pn-exchange.md)]  
  
  - In both directions - from [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../../includes/pn-exchange.md)] to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] **and** from [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] to [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../../includes/pn-exchange.md)]  
  
  You can also disable field synchronization between a pair of fields.
