# System Settings dialog box - Synchronization tab
Use the settings on this page to determine how data is synchronized between [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_dynamics_crm_for_outlook](../../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-for-outlook.md)]. For example, you can control synchronization between pairs of fields or enable or disable synchronization of additional mailing addresses, assigned tasks, or appointment attachments.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The **Synchronization** tab was introduced in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_2015_update](../../includes/pn-crm-online-2015-update.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_2016](../../includes/pn-crm-2016.md)] (on-premises).  
  
#### Open the System Settings dialog box (if itâ€™s not already open)  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_permissions_system_admin_and_customizer](../../includes/proc-permissions-system-admin-and-customizer.md)]  
  
   ###### Check your security role  
  
   - [!INCLUDE[proc_follow_steps_in_link](../../includes/proc-follow-steps-in-link.md)]  
  
   - [!INCLUDE[proc_dont_have_correct_permissions](../../includes/proc-dont-have-correct-permissions.md)]  
  
2. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_administration](../../includes/proc-settings-administration.md)]  
  
3. Choose the **System Settings** > **Synchronization** tab.

This is due to the remapping of the attributes for existing tracked contacts. The best practice is to do in-house testing to understand how the re-mapping affects your environment and data. In most cases, you should have the full data in one side (normally in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]) and sync to the other side (normally [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../../includes/pn-exchange.md)]). |
