# Set personal options that affect tracking and synchronization between Dynamics 365 and Outlook or Exchange
You can use the **Set Personal Options** dialog box in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_dynamics_crm_for_outlook](../../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-for-outlook.md)] or in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] to set many options that affect tracking and synchronization.  
  
 To open the **Set Personal Options** dialog box:  
  
- In [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)], on the **File** menu, click **Dynamics 365**, and then click **Options**.  
  
   -Or-  
  
- In [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], click the **Settings** button ![Options button for Dynamics 365](../media/optionsbutton.png "Options button for Dynamics 365") in the upper-right corner of the screen, and then click **Options**.  
  
  The following table summarizes the tracking and synchronization options available in the **Set Personal Options** dialog box. The **Available** column indicates whether the option is available in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)], [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], or both. This column also indicates if the option is available for [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] synchronization, server-side synchronization (also known as “[!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../../includes/pn-exchange.md)] synchronization”), or both. More information: [Frequently asked questions about synchronizing records between Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Microsoft Outlook](frequently-asked-questions-synchronizing-records.md)  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Some of the options on the **Synchronization** tab are available only if you’re using [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_2015_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-2015-shortest.md)] or later or if you’re using [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)].
