1.  These steps apply only if you have an [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../../includes/pn-office-365.md)] subscription in addition to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)].

     ![Add a Dynamics 365 Organization dialog box](../media/crm-outlook-add-organization.png "Add a Dynamics 365 Organization dialog box")  
  
    > [!NOTE]
