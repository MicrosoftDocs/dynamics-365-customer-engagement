# Set an option to automatically track incoming Outlook email in Dynamics 365 for Outlook
When you use [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_dynamics_crm_for_outlook](../../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-for-outlook.md)] to track an email message, a copy of the email record is saved as an activity in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] and synchronized with the [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] record. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Overview of tracking records in Dynamics 365 for Outlook](overview-tracking-records.md)  
  
 By default, tracking email is a manual process—you have to choose the **Track** button or the **Set Regarding** button for each email message you want to track. Manual tracking provides a way for you to keep your personal email separate from your customer email. As an alternative, you can set an option to track email messages automatically.  
  
> [!TIP]
>  You can use [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../../includes/pn-exchange.md)] folder tracking as an alternate method for tracking messages automatically. With folder tracking, you can track messages directly from virtually any device. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Track Outlook email by moving it to a tracked Exchange folder](track-outlook-email-by-moving-it-tracked-exchange-folder.md)  
  
## Automatically track email messages  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)], on the **File** tab, choose **[!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]**, and then choose **Options**.  
  
2.  In the **Set Personal Options** dialog box, on the **Email** tab, in the **Select how [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] should integrate email with [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]** section, select the **Check incoming email in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] and determine whether an email should be linked and saved as a [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] record** option.  
  
3.  To specify whether to track all email messages or only certain types, in the **Select the email messages to track in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]** section, in the **Track** list, select one of the following options:  
  
    -   **All email messages**. Tracks all email messages (sent and received) related to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] email messages. If you select this option, Dynamics 365 will track junk mail as well as business conversations, so choose this option carefully.  
  
    -   **Email messages in response to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] email**. Only replies to or forwards of email messages that have already been tracked will be saved as email activities. This is the most common option.  
  
    -   **Email messages from Dynamics 365 Leads, Contacts, and Accounts**. Tracks email messages only if they originate from someone with a [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] lead, contact, or account record.  
  
    -   **Email messages from [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] records that are email enabled**. Tracks email messages from all record types (including custom record types) that contain an email address field.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Keep in mind that the more you use the same email address for tracking purposes, the less useful it becomes since it will be mapped to many records.  
  
4.  If you want to automatically create contract or lead records for tracked email messages, in the **Automatically create records in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]** section, choose the **Create** check box, and then choose **Contacts** or **Leads** from the list. When this check box is selected, [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] will try to match the email address of recipients to an email address in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. If it can’t find a matching record, it will automatically create a contact or lead record.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Contact and lead records won’t be created if you don’t have the appropriate security permissions. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [TechNet: How security affects synchronization between Dynamics 365 and Outlook](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn832097.aspx)  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  More than one custom record type can contain the same email address. When this happens, [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] links the email messages **received** from this email address to the custom record type created first. For example, let’s say a Patient record type created in January lists the email address someone@example.com. A Doctor record type created in February lists the same email address. [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] links the email messages received from someone@example.com to the Patient record type only. **Sending** an email message to someone@example.com links the email message to the Patient record type and the Doctor record type, however.
