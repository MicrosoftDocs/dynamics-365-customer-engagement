# Dynamics 365 for Outlook support
This topic contains links to information about the supported software requirements for [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_dynamics_crm_for_outlook](../../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-for-outlook.md)].  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  For [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] applications, we recommend using the latest version and service pack (SP) for all required components, such as [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Server](../../includes/pn-windows-server.md)], [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_SQL_Server](../../includes/pn-ms-sql-server.md)], [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Office](../../includes/pn-ms-office.md)], [!INCLUDE[pn_Internet_Explorer](../../includes/pn-internet-explorer.md)], and [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange_Server_full](../../includes/pn-exchange-server-full.md)]. In some cases, there might be a delay between the availability of a component update and support for the update in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] applications. However, you should always apply the latest update for [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] to fully support the latest version of a required component.
