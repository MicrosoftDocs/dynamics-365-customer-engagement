>

> 
>  To install and run the 64-bit version of [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)], a 64-bit version of [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Office](../../includes/pn-ms-office.md)] is required.

To verify if [!INCLUDE[pn_JavaScript](../../includes/pn-javascript.md)] is enabled in [!INCLUDE[pn_Internet_Explorer](../../includes/pn-internet-explorer.md)], start [!INCLUDE[pn_Internet_Explorer](../../includes/pn-internet-explorer.md)], on the **Tools** menu click or tap **Internet options**.
