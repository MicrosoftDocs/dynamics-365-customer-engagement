# Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Outlook hardware requirements
The following table lists the minimum recommended hardware requirements when you run [!INCLUDE [pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-for-outlook](../../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-for-outlook.md)] in either online only or go offline enabled modes.  
  
|Component|Online only mode|Go Offline enabled mode|  
|---------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|  
|Processor|x86- or x64-bit 1.9 gigahertz (GHz) or faster dual core processor with SSE2 instruction set|x86- or x64-bit 1.9 gigahertz (GHz) or faster dual core processor with SSE2 instruction set|  
|Memory|2-GB RAM or more|4-GB RAM or more|  
|Hard disk|1.5 GB of available hard disk space|2 GB of available hard disk space<br /><br /> 7200 RPM or more|  
|Display|Super VGA with a resolution of 1024 x 768|Super VGA with a resolution higher than 1024 x 768|

>   
>  Running [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] on a computer that has less than the minimum recommended requirements may result in inadequate performance. For the best performance, we recommend running 64-bit versions of [!INCLUDE[pn-ms-Windows-long](../../includes/pn-ms-windows-long.md)], [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Office](../../includes/pn-ms-office.md)], and [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-for-outlook-short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)].  

 **Network requirements**  
  
 [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] is designed to work best over networks that have the following elements:  
  
-   Bandwidth greater than 50 KBps (400 kbps)  
  
-   Latency under 150 ms  
  
 These values are recommendations and don’t guarantee satisfactory performance. The recommended values are based on systems using out-of-the box forms that aren’t customized. If you significantly customize the out-of-box forms, we recommend that you test the form response to understand bandwidth needs.

> [!NOTE]
>  Successful network installation of [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-for-outlook-short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] requires a reliable and high-throughput network. Otherwise, installation might fail. The recommended minimum available bandwidth of the network connection is 300 Kbps.
