This also applies to [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Office](../../includes/pn-ms-office.md)]: If you are running and intend to retain a 32-bit version of [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Office](../../includes/pn-ms-office.md)], you can upgrade only to 32-bit Dynamics CRM 2016 for Outlook.  
  
- **Cross-architecture upgrade requires uninstalling and reinstalling**. If you have a 64-bit PC running a 64-bit version of [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Windows_long](../../includes/pn-ms-windows-long.md)], you can change from 32-bit to 64-bit [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_2016_outlook_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-2016-outlook-shortest.md)] by performing the following steps in the order listed.  
  
  1. Make sure that your PC has a 64-bit version of Windows. [How to determine whether a computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/827218).
