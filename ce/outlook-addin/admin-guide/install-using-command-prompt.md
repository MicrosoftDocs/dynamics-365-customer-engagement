# Install Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Outlook using a command prompt
Installing [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_dynamics_crm_for_outlook](../../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-for-outlook.md)] is a two-step procedure. First, you must run Setup to install the files on the computer. Next, run the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)][!INCLUDE[pn_configuration_wizard](../../includes/pn-configuration-wizard.md)] to configure the application and complete the installation.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  If there’s a conflict between a value in the configuration file and a value in the command-line parameters, the command-line parameter takes precedence.

This package lets users run [!INCLUDE[pn_Setup](../../includes/pn-setup.md)] from a network share or lets non-administrative users run [!INCLUDE[pn_Setup](../../includes/pn-setup.md)] that is driven from a group policy. This parameter must be used with the **/targetdir** parameter described earlier. When using this parameter, the **/targetdir** value doesn’t have to be located on the local computer. A mapped drive or network share, such as \\\\*share\mscrm_client_admin*, can be used. **Important:**  If you don’t specify a target folder by using the `/targetdir` parameter, [!INCLUDE[pn_Setup](../../includes/pn-setup.md)] installs the administrative installation to the default folder \<*drive*:> Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics CRM. <br /><br /> For example, the command:<br /><br /> `Setupclient /Q /A /targetdir "\\share\mscrm_client_admin"` |

### Sample Dynamics 365 for Outlook XML configuration file for installation  
 The following configuration-file example installs [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] without offline access capability into the Program Files folder.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can use the same file that includes both the installation and configuration elements. [!INCLUDE[pn_Setup](../../includes/pn-setup.md)] and the [!INCLUDE[pn_configuration_wizard](../../includes/pn-configuration-wizard.md)] ignore the elements that aren’t relevant to the operation.  
  
```  
<Deployments>  
<TargetDir>c:\program files\Microsoft Dynamics CRM\Client</TargetDir>  
<InstallOfflineCapability>false</InstallOfflineCapability>  
</Deployments>  
```

## Step 2: Configure Dynamics 365 for Outlook by using an XML configuration file  
 After you install [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)], you must configure it. You can do this by running the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)][!INCLUDE[pn_configuration_wizard](../../includes/pn-configuration-wizard.md)] at the command prompt. The [!INCLUDE[pn_configuration_wizard](../../includes/pn-configuration-wizard.md)] file is named **Microsoft.Crm.Application.Outlook.ConfigWizard.exe** and is located in the Client\ConfigWizard folder where [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] is installed. By default, the folder is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics CRM.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The credentials of the user who will run [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] are used to authenticate to [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]. Therefore, to perform a silent configuration of [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)], you must run the [!INCLUDE[pn_configuration_wizard](../../includes/pn-configuration-wizard.md)] under the user's context, such as by running a user-invoked batch file or as a one-time entry in a logon script. For more information, see [User credentials are required when you run the Configuration Wizard](install-using-command-prompt.md#BKMK_usercred_CW). To deploy [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] by using Microsoft Group Policy, see [Deploy Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Outlook by using Group Policy](deploy-using-group-policy.md).  
> 
>  If a path to the configuration file isn’t specified, the [!INCLUDE[pn_configuration_wizard](../../includes/pn-configuration-wizard.md)] looks for the default configuration file (**default_client_config.xml**) in the non-roaming profile folder (%localappdata%\Microsoft\MSCRM\\). If the file isn’t located in the non-roaming profile folder, the [!INCLUDE[pn_configuration_wizard](../../includes/pn-configuration-wizard.md)] looks for the folder where [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] is installed. By default, [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] is installed in the C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics CRM folder.  
> 
>  If the configuration file is located in the roaming location used by other applications (AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\MSCRM\\), it won’t be honored.

## Command examples for the Dynamics 365 for Outlook configuration  
 The following command configures [!INCLUDE[pn_oc_laptop_short](../../includes/pn-oc-laptop-short.md)] by using a file named **config_client.xml** in quiet mode, and outputs a log file named **clientinstall.log**:  
  
```  
Microsoft.Crm.Application.Outlook.ConfigWizard.exe /Q /i c:\config_client.xml /xa /l c:\clientinstall.log  
```  
  
 The /**Q** quiet mode configuration parameter requires a configuration file in XML format. No dialog boxes or error messages will appear on the display screen. To capture error message information, include the log file parameter (/**L**) or verbose logging (/**LV**).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Valid user credentials stored in the Windows Vault are required to run the [!INCLUDE[pn_configuration_wizard](../../includes/pn-configuration-wizard.md)] in quiet mode. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [User credentials are required when you run the Configuration Wizard](install-using-command-prompt.md#BKMK_usercred_CW)  
  
 The `/i` [*drive*:] [[*path*] *configfilename.xml*]] command-line parameter provides [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Dynamics_CRM_for_Outlook_Setup](../../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-for-outlook-setup.md)] with required information. It is the same information that each installation screen requires. The XML elements must be in English (US); special or extended characters can’t be used. An XML configuration file that has localized XML elements will not work correctly. An explanation of each XML element and a sample XML file follows:  
  
 The `/xa` parameter, when used with the /q parameter, removes all organizations that are configured for [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)].  
  
 The /R parameter may be used to suppress the [!INCLUDE[pn_configuration_wizard](../../includes/pn-configuration-wizard.md)] user interface and only display the progress dialog box. This parameter requires a valid XML[!INCLUDE[pn_Setup](../../includes/pn-setup.md)] file that is named Default_Client_Config.xml and must be located in either the local user AppData or Client installation folder.

## User credentials are required when you run the Configuration Wizard  
 The [!INCLUDE[pn_configuration_wizard](../../includes/pn-configuration-wizard.md)] requires user credentials. During a silent configuration, by using /Q with the Microsoft.Crm.Application.Outlook.ConfigWizard.exe file, the [!INCLUDE[pn_configuration_wizard](../../includes/pn-configuration-wizard.md)] will look for the user’s credentials in the Windows Vault. If the [!INCLUDE[pn_configuration_wizard](../../includes/pn-configuration-wizard.md)] can’t find the credentials, or the credentials aren’t in the required format, the configuration will not finish and an error will be recorded to the configuration log file. Notice that the [!INCLUDE[pn_configuration_wizard](../../includes/pn-configuration-wizard.md)] doesn’t support adding the user UPN or password in the XML configuration file. For information about how to add user credentials from a command script to the Windows Vault, see the blog post [Silent configuration of CRM for Outlook client in CRM 2011 claims enabled environment](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/crmindia/archive/2012/12/23/silent-configuration-of-crm-for-outlook-client-in-crm-2011-claims-enabled-environment.aspx).

## Sample Dynamics 365 for Outlook XML configuration file for configuration  
 The following configuration file example configures [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] to connect to a primary organization named *Contoso* and another organization named *AdventureWorksCycle* on the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)] that is named *crmserver*.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can use the same file that includes both the installation and configuration elements. [!INCLUDE[pn_Setup](../../includes/pn-setup.md)] and the [!INCLUDE[pn_configuration_wizard](../../includes/pn-configuration-wizard.md)] will ignore the elements that aren’t relevant to the operation.  
> 
>  **Example Default_Client_Config.xml file**  
  
```  
<Deployments>  
<Deployment>  
<DiscoveryUrl>http://crmserver</DiscoveryUrl>  
<Organizations>  
<Organization IsPrimary='true'>Contoso</Organization>  
<Organization>AdventureWorksCycle</Organization>  
</Organizations>  
<CEIPNotification>false</CEIPNotification>  
</Deployment>  
</Deployments>  
```  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The preceding example specifies two different organizations that the user has access to and configures [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] to not display the “I want to join the Customer Experience Improvement Program” notification banner. The value in the `Organization` element can’t contain special characters or spaces. For [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_op_edition](../../includes/pn-crm-op-edition.md)], you can find the organization unique name by running the Get-CrmOrganization [!INCLUDE[pn_PowerShell](../../includes/pn-powershell.md)] cmdlet or go to **Settings** > **Customizations** > **Developer Resources** and under **Instance Reference Information** copy the **Unique Name**.  
  
### Configure Dynamics 365 for Outlook by using a script  
  
1. Write a script that automatically updates the configuration settings for users of [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)]. You could use lines such as the following to perform the basic configuration actions, based on a new configuration file that is stored on the computer indicated as <`servername`>.  
  
    In the following script, the default client configuration file is overwritten, previously configured organizations are removed, user credentials are added to the Windows Vault, and the new organization is installed.  
  
   ```  
   copy /y \\<servername>\share\Default_Client_Config.xml "c:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics CRM\Default_Client_Config.xml"  
   "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics CRM\Client\ConfigWizard\Microsoft.Crm.Application.Outlook.ConfigWizard.exe" /q /xa  
   cmdkey /generic:Microsoft_CRM_https://disco.crm.dynamics.com/ /user:user@contoso.com /password{password_goes_here}  
   "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics CRM\Client\ConfigWizard\Microsoft.Crm.Application.Outlook.ConfigWizard.exe" /q /i   
   "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics CRM\Default_Client_Config.xml"  
   ```  
  
   > [!TIP]
   >  Consider running your script as a logon script, or forcing the script to run at a specific time, such as by using [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_system_center_config_mgr_2012_long](../../includes/pn-ms-system-center-config-mgr-2012-long.md)].  
   > 
   >  In the script, you might also want to include detection logic that determines whether the client computer has already been configured. If it has, you can have the script exit without taking action.  
  
    **Example Default_Client_Config.xml file**  
  
   ```  
   <Deployment>  
   <DiscoveryUrl>http://CrmDiscoveryUrl</DiscoveryUrl>  
   <Organizations>  
   <Organization IsPrimary='true'>Organization1</Organization>  
   </Organizations>  
   </Deployment>  
   ```  
  
2. Run the script on each client computer in the organization whose server has changed. You can run the script in various ways, including through the **Profile** tab of the user properties dialog box in [!INCLUDE[pn_Active_Directory_Users_Computers](../../includes/pn-active-directory-users-computers.md)] (ADUC), or through Group Policy Objects (GPO).
