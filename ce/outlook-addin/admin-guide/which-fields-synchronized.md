# Which fields can be synchronized between Dynamics 365 apps and Outlook?
[!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] administrators can control field synchronization between [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_dynamics_crm_for_outlook](../../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-for-outlook.md)]. For example, admins can control the synchronization direction between pairs of fields. For information about which fields can be synchronized between  [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)], see [What fields can be synchronized with Outlook?](../../admin/what-fields-synchronized-outlook.md)
