# Manage Stream TV games in Gamification

Display a slide show for daily, weekly, and monthly KPIs on TVs and screens around your office. All other game models can also be displayed on TVs.
To create a Stream TV from multiple active games, see [Stream results from active games](configure-view-tvs.md#stream-results-from-active-games).

## Set up a Stream TV game

 Create a Stream TV game model if you want to display KPIs on screens around your office.

### Create a Stream TV slide show

1. In [!INCLUDE[cc_gamification_portal](../includes/cc-gamification-portal.md)], go to **Games** > **Game Setup**.

2. Provide a **Name** for the game and select **Stream TV** from the **Game Model** menu.

3. Set the **Start Date** and **End Date**.

4. Define the KPIs you want to display on screens.

5. Select the players and fans you want to show on the leaderboard.

6. To apply your configuration, select **Save TV** .

   You'll be redirected to the **Add or Edit Stream TV** page to configure how the results are displayed.

7. Provide a **TV Name** and set the values for how to transition in the slide show.

8. Configure the first slide, and set the **Leaderboard** to display the underlying **KPI** and the **Number of Players on Leaderboard**. You can also edit the **Leaderboard Title** and choose from the available **Themes** for the slide.

9. Optionally, make this Stream TV accessible from the public Internet. A commissioner can allow the creation of public Stream TVs in [!INCLUDE[pn-gamification-shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] settings. If it's allowed, you can set **Enable Public Stream TV** to **ON**. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information-md.md)] [Define the posts to show in Stream TV games](personalize-game-experience.md#define-the-posts-to-show-in-stream-tv-games)

10. To add the next leaderboard to your slide show, select **Add Slide** ![Add button in Gamification](media/add-button-gamification.png "Add button in Gamification").

11. To complete the TV setup, select **Save & Close**.

12. Select **View TV** ![View button in Gamification](media/view-symbol-gamification.png "View button in Gamification") for the slide show you want to display on other screens, and then a new browser tab opens. Copy and share the URL to see the same stream on other screens around your office. If public Stream TVs are enabled, the leaderboards will show them without requiring viewers to sign in.

13. Copy the URL of the newly opened browser tab, and enter it in the browser connected to the screen in your office.

## Stream results from active games
