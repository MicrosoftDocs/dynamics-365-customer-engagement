# Manage settings to personalize the game experience in Gamification

As a commissioner, you can upload custom logos, provide a pointer for players to get in touch with you, configure Stream TV posts, and choose how to handle player stats and completed games in [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification](../includes/pn-gamification.md)].  

## Generate a security key

The security key is required to connect the web portal of [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] with a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_subsequent](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] organization. If you disconnect the web portal from Dynamics 365 (online) and want to connect it again, click **Generate Security Key** to get a new key.
If you are already connected to a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_subsequent](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] organization, you can remove it after all active games are completed. 

> [!WARNING]
> When you remove an organization, all related data such as games, points, KPIs, and user accounts will be permanently deleted.

## Edit the company logo  

Change the company logo to be shown in [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] leaderboards.
