> [!TIP]
> - Have a  look at a comparable periods (previous month/ quarter/ same period in prior year) to estimate the average performance on KPIs and adjust points and scores to your business requirements.
> - Although it isn't reflected in [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)], any KPI (especially revenue KPIs) can be set as a quota KPI in [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)]. It could be an actual performance against quota, or reps could be providing their own quotas as forecasts, in which case the true KPI being measured would be forecast accuracy.
> - Many KPIs have been completely customized, based on higher-level activity represented in custom entities or standard entities that have been customized to meet the requirements of a specific organization.
> - You can include fun KPIs as well. Sometimes important activities aren't tracked in [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)]. You can score these KPIs as bonus points by using [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_excel](../includes/pn-microsoft-excel.md)] in combination with [!INCLUDE[pn_Excel_short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)] point scoring capabilities. For example, you might reward your employees for cycling to work instead of driving.
