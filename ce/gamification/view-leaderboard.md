# See how you rank against other players on a Gamification leaderboard

There's no real competition without a leaderboard. [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification](../includes/pn-gamification.md)] offers several leaderboards, depending on how the game is set up.

## Find your way around

 In [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)], click **My Games** > **Leaderboards** to see the various rankings.
  
 You can choose the game leaderboards you want to see, and switch between the different types of leaderboards.

## Types of leaderboards

 Depending on how the game is set up, you'll find the following leaderboards along with their KPIs and prizes awarded to the winners.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Leaderboards show a snapshot of the game. Only after a commissioner officially completes the game are the rankings final.

- **Fantasy Team Awards**: See which players drafted the most successful teams.

- **Fan Team Awards**: See which fans drafted the most successful fan teams.  
     This leaderboard is only available if fans participate in a game.

- **Game MVP Award**: See which players earned the most points in the current game.

- **Position Awards**: See how players rank in the available positions.

- **KPI Awards**: See how players rank overall in the awarded KPIs.

- **Weekly Awards**: See which players rank best in a given week for a specific KPI.
