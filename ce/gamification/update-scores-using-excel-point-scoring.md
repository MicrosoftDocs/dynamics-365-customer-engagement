# Update game scores by using Excel point scoring capabilities in Gamification

If you plan to run a game that uses one or more KPIs that can't be tracked by using [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)], you can update the scores for those KPIs by using a [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_excel](../includes/pn-microsoft-excel.md)] template.  
  
> [!TIP]
>  To minimize the ongoing effort required to run a game, we recommend that you rely on KPIs defined in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_subsequent](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)].  
  
## Update scores by using the Excel file
  
1.  Go to **Games** > **Games**.  
  
2.  Click the **[!INCLUDE[pn_Excel_short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)] Point Scoring** ( ![Excel point scoring button in Gamification](media/excel-point-scoring-gamification.png "Excel point scoring button in Gamification")) button.  
  
3.  Select the game you want to update the scores from, and then click the game period you want to update.  
  
4.  Click **Download [!INCLUDE[pn_Excel_short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)] template** ![Download Excel template in Gamification](media/download-excel-gamification.png "Download Excel template in Gamification"), and then update the scores in the file.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >  The manually scored data needs to be up-to-date for the respective game period. All other KPIs will continuously sync from [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_subsequent](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)].  
  
5.  Click **Upload [!INCLUDE[pn_Excel_short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)] file** ![Upload Excel file in Gamification](media/upload-excel-gamification.png "Upload Excel file in Gamification") to upload the file, including the manually updated scores.  
  
 The selected KPIs are now updated in [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] for the selected game period.
