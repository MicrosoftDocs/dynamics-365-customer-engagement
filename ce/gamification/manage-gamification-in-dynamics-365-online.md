# Install and configure the Gamification solution in Dynamics 365 (online)

The [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification](../includes/pn-gamification.md)] capabilities are a solution for [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)], hosted on [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_appsource](../includes/pn-microsoft-appsource.md)], that you need to install before you can start using the capabilities to manage your [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] games, KPIs, and players.  
  
## Prerequisites  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] requires at least [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_8_1_0_online](../includes/pn-crm-8-1-0-online.md)].  
  
-   Users must have a [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] license assigned to access the [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] service.  
  
-   Users must have an up-to-date browser. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information-md.md)] [Browser requirements to enable a seamless experience in Gamification](browser-system-requirements.md)  

## Install Dynamics 365 - Gamification  

[!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] capabilities in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)] are a solution for [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] that you install from [Microsoft AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=830919).  

### Limitations

We recommend to adhere to the following limits when working with [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] to avoid synchronization and performance issues: 
- Up to **15** concurrent games.
- Up to **500** users per game.
- Up to **10** fixed teams per game.
- Up to **4000** users across all connected organizations.
  
> [!NOTE]
> To avoid timeout issues when syncing the data of more than 2000 users, you need to change the number of users sent per page in the [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] settings.    
> In Dynamics 365, select **Advanced Find**. Look for **Gamification Settings** and select **Results**. Open the **Gamification Settings** and lower the value for **Users sent per page**.

### Install the solution from AppSource  
  
1.  In [AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=830919), select **[!INCLUDE[pn_gamification](../includes/pn-gamification.md)]**.  
  
2.  Sign in to your [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] system admin account, if you aren't already signed in.  
  
3.  Click **Get** to start installing the solution.  
If you have more than one [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_subsequent](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] organization, select the organization you want to install this solution to.
  
4.  Review and accept the disclaimer and the terms to add [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] to [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)].  
  
 It might take a few minutes for the solution to be installed in [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)].  
  
## Game Manager security role in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_subsequent](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] 

 When you install [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)], a security role called **Game Manager** is created in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_subsequent](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)]. System admins can assign this security role to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_subsequent](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] users who the admins want to enable to create KPIs for [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_subsequent](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)].

## Activate Gamification in Dynamics 365 (online)

Before you can sync [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification](../includes/pn-gamification.md)] with [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)], a user who has a global admin role in [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-ms-office-365.md)] and a system administrator security role in [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] needs to complete the setup process to obtain the security key.  


> [!TIP]
> Starting with Gamification solution update 17.10, you can connect multiple organizations (business units) of the same Office 365 tenant to a shared Gamification web portal. Repeat the [installation](manage-gamification-in-dynamics-365-online.md#install-dynamics-365---gamification) and [activation](manage-gamification-in-dynamics-365-online.md#activate-gamification-in-dynamics-365-online) for every organization you want to connect to your shared Gamification portal. Users with the Game Manager security role in Organization A can create games for Organization A in Gamification. If they are regular users in Organization B, they can participate as players or fans in games in Organization B. [Learn how to set up and run games.](run-games.md)
