Dispatchers and service managers can use the resource utilization metric to make informed scheduling decisions.

Utilization is the amount of time a dispatcher schedules a resource to work. The metric is the percentage of booked time versus working hours. On the schedule board, resource utilization shows next to a resource's name.

## Calculate resource utilization

> [!NOTE]
> Resource capacity and requirement effort are not considered in utilization calculations.

Utilization percentage derives from **Total Booked Hours** divided by **Total Working Hours** in the selected date range.

Formula: ((Total booked hours  in date range)/(Total working hours x days in date range)) x 100

- **Total Booked Hours** is the sum of the hours booked to the resource for bookings in a *Committed* status.

- **Total Working Hours** is the sum of the resource's working hours. A setting on the *Bookable Resource* record defines the working hours. For more information, see [Set up bookable resources](../../field-service/set-up-bookable-resources.md).

### Example

A resource works an eight-hour shift, Monday to Friday. The date range on the schedule board shows a seven-day week, Monday to Sunday.

Total working hours are 40 hours (5 x 8 hours).

If the dispatcher books the resource for 10 hours throughout the work week, their total working hours are 10.

So the resource has a utilization of 25% ((10 / (5 x 8)) x 100)).

### Booking status influence on utilization

Your [business processes can use several booking statuses](../../field-service/set-up-booking-statuses.md), such as traveling, in progress, on break, and completed. Each of them maps to a booking status of either *Committed*, *Proposed*, or *Canceled*. Bookings map to the *Committed* status when confirmed and a resource completes the work. The *Proposed* status suggests unconfirmed work. The *Canceled* status notifies stakeholders that the booking is no longer scheduled.

The utilization metric ignores bookings with a *Proposed* or *Canceled* booking status.
