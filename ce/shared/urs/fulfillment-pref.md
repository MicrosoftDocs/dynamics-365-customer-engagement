Fulfillment preferences customize how the schedule assistant displays results for single-day requirements. By default, the schedule assistant shows results based on resource schedules and the earliest available time. Fulfillment preferences include intervals and time groups, or a combination of them.

## Intervals

Intervals define the length of the times slots the schedule assistant results are displayed in, and the start time for subsequent bookings. For example, with 30-minute intervals, the schedule assistant displays a resource available at 9:27 AM as available at 9:30 AM and books the start time (arrival time) for 9:30 AM. Travel time is included for onsite requirements and work orders, meaning travel time begins before 9:30 AM, and a field resource would arrive and start work at 9:30 AM.

## Time groups

Time groups enable schedulers to search and view results as blocks of time when using the schedule assistant. Unlike intervals, time groups don't influence the start time of subsequent booking. Time groups organize results, but leave the start time/arrival time as-is, based on the particular resource's schedule.

For example, a heating and cooling company wants to group air-conditioning installations in two blocks. They create morning (8:00 AM to 12:00 PM) and afternoon (1:00 PM to 5:00 PM) blocks, with a one-hour break for lunch in between. They communicate a morning or afternoon time range to customers for when the installation crew arrives.

## Create a fulfillment preference

1. In Universal Resource Scheduling, open the **Settings** area. Under **Scheduling**, select **Fulfillment Preferences** and select **New**.

1. Enter a **Name** and **Save** the record.

1. To define an interval, go to the **Interval** tab.
   - Choose an **Interval** to define the duration between two available time slots. 
   - Set the time for **Intervals begin** to define the start time for when options are available, depending on resource availability and working hours. 
   - Enter the number of **Results per Interval** to limit how many options the system presents for a time slot.

### Associate fulfillment preference to a requirement or requirement group

Open a requirement and go to the **Scheduling** tab to choose the **Fulfillment Preference**. For a requirement group, you can choose it in the **Fulfillment Preference** column.

### Book a requirement

Open a resource requirement and select **Book** to schedule the requirement. The start and end times match the fulfillment preference you defined for the requirement.

## Using intervals and time groups together

You can add both an interval and a time group to the same fulfillment preference, but first review these important considerations.

- Don't add a value for **Interval Begins**. The interval begins at the time of the earliest time group.

- If the **Reset Interval per Time Group Detail** option is set to **Yes**, the intervals reset once a new time group detail overlaps with an interval.

  For example, a business offers appointments every 90 minutes, so intervals are set to 90 minutes. Additionally, they separate into morning and afternoon time groups of 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 1:00PM to 5:00 PM, with a one-hour lunch in between.

  - If the **Reset Interval per Time Group Detail** is set to **No**, the appointments would be:

    8:00 AM, 9:30 AM, 11:00 AM (not 12:30 PM because it's blocked for lunch), 2:00 PM, and 3:30 PM.

  - If the **Reset Interval per Time Group Detail** is set to **Yes**, the appointments would be:

    8:00 AM, 9:30 AM, 11:00 AM (not 12:30 PM because it's blocked for lunch), **1:00 PM** (resetting for the next time group detail), 2:30 PM, and 4:00 PM.
