### Enhancements
- Resources associated to facilities will no longer return in onsite schedule assistant searches. This prevents customers from accidentally scheduling a resource that should be stationed at a facility from going to a customer location.
- Resources that are not associated or related to a facility will no longer return in facility searches. Currently, when a resource is set up to work at a facility through an association or as a child resource of a pool, URS does not account for travel to the facility. 
- When using the schedule assistant to schedule a requirement group, if the requirement‘s work location is set to facility, and there are no options selected under the “part of same” attribute, the search will execute as if part of same “Resource Tree” is selected.
- Saving a filter on the schedule board now shows a green confirmation checkmark instead of a yellow warning symbol.
- Warning message will now be displayed when trying to change the latitude or longitude field on a booking.
- Added validation to check that if a resource is associated to a facility, then it should not be allowed to be a child resource of a pool associated to a facility or facility pool for the same timeframe.

### Version 3.1.0.166

- If a booking has the work location field set to location agnostic, the booking will be treated as location agnostic even if there is a latitude and longitude value on the booking.

- When searching for a resource in the resource search bar on the schedule board list view, if no resources can be found, the board properly removes all resources.

### Enhancements
- Resources associated to facilities will no longer return in onsite schedule assistant searches. This prevents customers from accidentally scheduling a resource that should be stationed at a facility from going to a customer location.
- Resources that are not associated or related to a facility will no longer return in facility searches. Currently, when a resource is setup to work at a facility through an association or as a child resource of a pool, URS does not account for travel to the facility. Therefore, only resources set to work at a facility will return in facility searches.
- When using the schedule assistant to schedule a requirement group, if the requirement(s) work location is set to facility, and there are no options selected under “part of same” attribute, the search will execute as if part of same “Resource Tree” is selected.
- Saving a filter on the Schedule Board now shows a green confirmation checkmark instead of a yellow warning symbol.
- Warning message will now be displayed to a user if they try and change the latitude or longitude field on a booking.
- Added validation to check if a resource is associated to a Facility then it should not be allowed to be a child resource of a pool that is associated to a Facility or Facility pool for the same timeframe.
