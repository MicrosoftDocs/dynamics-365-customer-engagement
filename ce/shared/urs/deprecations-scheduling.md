## Deprecated: Configuration to automatically create a booking when an appointment is created

Effective from April 01, 2021, the configuration to automatically create a booking when an appointment is created is deprecated. Customers who already use the new schedule board should start moving to the improved way of [including appointments without needing corresponding bookings](../../field-service/appointment-scheduling.md). Those customers who rely on functions of the old schedule board that are not in the new schedule board (such as assisted scheduling / **Find Availability**) should note that parity between the old and new schedule board is planned for October 2021. End of life for the deprecated configuration that handles appointments through bookings is planned for April 2022, and customers should plan accordingly to migrate to the new functionality that directly includes appointments.
