# Action calls
An action call represents a call to a UII action associated with a hosted control. Action calls are used to pass parameters required to run the underlying UII action in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)].  
  
 An action call can be attached to the following in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] so that they are run when:  
  
- An event is raised.  
  
- A window navigation rule is processed.  
  
- A toolbar button is selected.  
  
- An agent script is run or an answer is selected.  
  
  The action calls, and the sequence in which they are called, define the behavior of the configured system. Action calls can be thought of as the function call itself, where the UII action is the function signature or definition.  
  
  You can also attach action calls to another action call to execute the attached action calls when the parent action call is run. The action calls attached to an action call are called the sub-action calls.
