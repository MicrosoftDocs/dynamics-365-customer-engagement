# Create a user-defined event



[!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] provides you with predefined events for hosted controls based on the type of the hosted control. Apart from these predefined events, you can also create your own events in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)], which are called user-defined events. You can use the **FireEvent** action or the event moniker to run user-defined events.  

<a name="FireEvent"></a>   
## Use the FireEvent action  
 All of the predefined and custom [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] hosted control types, except for the **CCA Hosted Application** have a special UII action called **FireEvent**. You can call this action to initiate a user-defined event from that control. This is a convenient way to group multiple action calls into a single call, effectively creating a function within [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]. It is also a reasonable way to test events and their action sequences before deployment.  

 The first parameter to the **FireEvent** is the name of the event:  

```  
name=MyEvent  
```  

 All subsequent name/value pairs become the parameters to the event and thus can be used as replacement parameters within the actions that are called as a result. For example, if you pass the following parameter list:  

```  
name=MyEvent  
var1=[[account.name]]  
```  

 This will fire the custom event **MyEvent** event enabling the ability to create an action call that uses the `var1` parameter as follows:  

```  
Hosted Control=Some Hosted Control  
UII Action=Some action on the Hosted Control  
Data=[[var1]]  
```  

 This passes the event parameter as a data parameter to the hosted control action. In this example, that means the data parameter to the hosted control will be the account.name value from the session.  

<a name="EventMoniker"></a>   
## Use the event moniker  
 You can create a custom event on a hosted control, and then call it using the following event moniker syntax:  

```  
http://event/?EventName=<EVENT_NAME>&key=value&key=value&…  
```  

 In the syntax, you specify the `key=value` pair to pass parameter list to be used when the event is triggered.  

 Consider an example where you want to raise a user-defined event whenever the title of the case on the case form changes in Microsoft Dataverse. To do this:  

1. Create a new event, called `TitleChanged`, for the **Incident** hosted control in Dataverse.  

2. Create an action call, called `Action Call for Title Change`, with the following values:  


   |     Field      |                                                                                                                         Value                                                                                                                         |
   |----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   |      Name      |                                                                                                             Action Call for Title Change                                                                                                              |
   | Hosted Control |                                                                                                                       Incident                                                                                                                        |
   |     Action     |                                                                                                                     RunXrmCommand                                                                                                                     |
   |      Data      | function titleChangeReaction()  {<br /> window.open(`http://event/?EventName=TitleChanged&NewTitle="+encodeURIComponent(Xrm.Page.getAttribute("title").getValue()`));<br /> }<br /> Xrm.Page.getAttribute("title").addOnChange(titleChangeReaction); |


3. Add the new action call that you created to the **BrowserDocumentComplete** event of the **Incident** hosted control. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Add action calls to an event](../unified-service-desk/add-action-calls-event.md)  

    When the `TitleChanged` event is triggered, the following request is raised: `http://event/?EventName=TitleChanged&NewTitle=<NEW_TITLE>`  

    This will cause the `TitleChanged` event to be triggered with the following data parameter: `NewTitle=<NEW_TITLE>`  

   If you use [!INCLUDE[pn_JavaScript](../includes/pn-javascript.md)] in Dataverse to invoke an event in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] using the event moniker (`http://event/?EventName=<EVENT_NAME>&key=value&key=value&…`), you can use the `window.IsUSD` property to determine whether the [!INCLUDE[pn_JavaScript](../includes/pn-javascript.md)] code is running under [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] when the event is invoked. The following code sample can be included in your [!INCLUDE[pn_JavaScript](../includes/pn-javascript.md)] code to ensure that the event is invoked only when the calling [!INCLUDE[pn_JavaScript](../includes/pn-javascript.md)] is running within [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)].  

```  
if ((window.IsUSD != null) && (window.IsUSD == true))  
{  
   window.open(http://event/?EventName=<EVENT_NAME>&key=value&key=value&…);  
}  
```
