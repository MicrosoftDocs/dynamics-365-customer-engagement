# Walkthrough: Create a UII Application Adapter
You can create an application adapter if you want to integrate an external application with [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]. [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] provides a [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio](../includes/pn-visual-studio.md)] template for creating an application adapter. The template provides basic code as comments to help you get started with creating the application adapter.  
  
 In this walkthrough, you’ll build an external application `QsExternalApp` and host it in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]. You’ll then create and configure an application adapter `ExternalApplicationAdapter` for the external application to interact with [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]. The external application has four labels: one each for the customer’s first name, last name, address and ID and four corresponding text boxes to display the values from [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)].

## Step 1: Build a sample external application  
  
1. [Download the UII SDK package](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=519179).  
  
2. Double-click the package file to extract the contents.  
  
3. Navigate to the \<ExtractedFolder>\UII\SampleCode\UII\AIF\QsExternalApp folder, and open the Microsoft.Uii.QuickStarts.QsExternalApp.csproj file in [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio_short](../includes/pn-visual-studio-short.md)].  
  
4. Press F5 or choose **Debug** > **Start Debugging** to create a sample external application. The application (Microsoft.Uii.QuickStarts.QsExternalApp.exe) is created in the /bin/debug folder of the project.  
  
   ![Sample external app](../unified-service-desk/media/usd-sample-external-app.PNG "Sample external app")  
  
<a name="ConfigureExApp"></a>   
## Step 2: Configure the external application in Microsoft Dynamics 365.  
 In this step, you will create a hosted control of **External Hosted Application** type to display the [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Windows_short](../includes/pn-ms-windows-short.md)] forms application.  
  
1. Sign in to **Microsoft Dynamics 365**.  
  
2. On the navigation bar, click or tap **Microsoft Dynamics 365**, and then select **Settings**.  
  
3. Click or tap **Settings** > **Unified Service Desk** > **Hosted Controls**.  
  
4. Click **New**.  
  
5. On the **New Hosted Control** page, specify the following values:  
  
   |Field|Value|  
   |-----------|-----------|  
   |Name|QsExternalApp|  
   |USD Component|CCA Hosted Application|  
   |Hosted Application|External Hosted Application|  
   |Application is Global|Checked|  
   |Display Group|MainPanel|  
   |Adapter|Use No Adapter|  
   |Application is Dynamic|No|  
   |External App URI|Microsoft.Uii.QuickStarts.QsExternalApp.exe|  
  
   ![Application adapter configuration screen](../unified-service-desk/media/usd-external-app-config-1.PNG "Application adapter configuration screen")  
  
   ![Unified Service Desk external app hosting settings](../unified-service-desk/media/usd-externa-app-config-2.PNG "Unified Service Desk external app hosting settings")  
  
6. Click **Save**.  
  
<a name="TestExApp"></a>   
## Step 3: Test the external application  
  
1. Copy the application from your [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio_short](../includes/pn-visual-studio-short.md)] project output folder (\<ProjectFolder>\bin\debug) to the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] application directory. In this case, we will copy the Microsoft.Uii.QuickStarts.QsExternalApp.exefile to the C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics CRM USD\USD directory.  
  
2. Run the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client to connect to your [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] server.  
  
3. On successful sign in, you’ll see the **Sample External Application** button on your desktop.  
  
4. Choose **Sample External Application** to see your external application hosted within [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)].  
  
   ![Sample external app in Unified Service Desk](../unified-service-desk/media/usd-sample-external-app-1.PNG "Sample external app in Unified Service Desk")  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  At this point the fields are empty as you’re only hosting the application in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]. To populate them with values from [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)], you’ll have to create an application adapter as described in the next step.  
  
<a name="CreateAppAdapter"></a>   
## Step 4: Create the application adapter  
  
1. Start [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio](../includes/pn-visual-studio.md)], and create a new project.  
  
2. In the **New Project** dialog box:  
  
   1. From the list of installed templates, expand [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_C#](../includes/pn-visual-csharp.md)], and select Dynamics 365 SDK Templates > **Unified Service Desk** > [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)] Application Adapter  
  
   2. Specify the name and location of the project, and click **OK** to create a new project.  
  
   ![External application adapter in Visual Studio](../unified-service-desk/media/usd-external-app-adapter-vs.PNG "External application adapter in Visual Studio")  
  
3. In Solution Explorer, expand the References section to ensure all the assembly references resolve correctly.  
  
4. Open the AppAdapter.cs file and add the following lines of code to set the locations for each component on the page in the class definition.  
  
   ```csharp  
   // Set up your locations for each component on the page.  
           // If you wish, you could use Spy++ to get the actual names as well.  
           // First Name text box  
           int intFirstNameCoordX = 47;  
           int intFirstNameCoordY = 32;  
           // Last Name text box  
           int intLastNameCoordX = 223;  
           int intLastNameCoordY = 32;  
           // Address Text box  
           int intAddressCoordX = 47;  
           int intAddressCoordY = 81;  
           // Customer ID text box  
           int intIDCoordX = 47;  
           int intIDCoordY = 126;  
   ```  
  
5. Add the following code to the definition of `NotifyContextChange` to notify the application that the context has changed. For more information, see [Context)](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.uii.csr.hostedapplicationadapter.notifycontextchange\(microsoft.uii.csr.context\))  
  
   ```csharp  
   public override bool NotifyContextChange(Context context)  
           {  
               IntPtr ptr = MainWindowHandle;  
               // Find the control (first name) by position  
               IntPtr childHwnd = Win32API.FindWindowByPosition(ptr, new Point(intFirstNameCoordX, intFirstNameCoordY));  
               // Fill data out  
               Win32API.SetWindowTextAny(childHwnd, context["firstname"]);  
               // Find the control (last name) by position  
               childHwnd = Win32API.FindWindowByPosition(ptr, new Point(intLastNameCoordX, intLastNameCoordY));  
               // Fill out the data  
               Win32API.SetWindowTextAny(childHwnd, context["lastname"]);  
               childHwnd = Win32API.FindWindowByPosition(ptr, new Point(intAddressCoordX, intAddressCoordY));  
               Win32API.SetWindowTextAny(childHwnd, context["address1_line1"]);  
               childHwnd = Win32API.FindWindowByPosition(ptr, new Point(intIDCoordX, intIDCoordY));  
               Win32API.SetWindowTextAny(childHwnd, context["CustomerID"]);  
               // Hands control back over to the base class to notify next app of context change.  
               return base.NotifyContextChange(context);  
  
           }  
   ```  
  
6. Add the following code to the override definition of `DoAction` to update the form fields with values from [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)].  
  
   ```csharp  
   public override bool DoAction(Microsoft.Uii.Csr.Action action, RequestActionEventArgs args)  
           {  
               IntPtr ptr;  
               IntPtr childHwnd;  
               switch (args.Action)  
               {  
                   case "UpdateFirstName":  
                       // Get locations of what you want to update and handles  
                       ptr = MainWindowHandle;  
                       childHwnd = Win32API.FindWindowByPosition(ptr, new Point(intFirstNameCoordX, intFirstNameCoordY));  
                       // Populate data into fields  
                       Win32API.SetWindowTextAny(childHwnd, args.Data);  
                       break;  
                   case "UpdateLastName":  
                       // Get locations of what you want to update and handles  
                       ptr = MainWindowHandle;  
                       childHwnd = Win32API.FindWindowByPosition(ptr, new Point(intLastNameCoordX, intLastNameCoordY));  
                       // Populate data into fields  
                       Win32API.SetWindowTextAny(childHwnd, args.Data);  
                       break;  
               }  
               return base.DoAction(action, args);  
           }  
   ```  
  
7. Save your project, and build it (**Build** > **Build Solution**). After the project builds successfully, an assembly (ExternalApplicationAdapter.dll) is generated in the \bin\debug folder of your project folder. You’ll need this assembly later for testing and using your application adapter.  
  
<a name="ConfigureAppAdapter"></a>   
## Step 4: Configure the application adapter in Dynamics 365  
  
1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].  
  
2. On the nav bar, choose **Microsoft Dynamics 365**, and then select **Settings**.  
  
3. Choose **Settings** > **Unified Service Desk** > **Hosted Controls**.  
  
4. From the list of hosted controls, select the `QsExternalApp` hosted control.  
  
   ![Hosted control in Unified Service Desk](../unified-service-desk/media/usd-external-app-hosted-control.PNG "Hosted control in Unified Service Desk")  
  
5. In the Adapter Configuration section, specify the following values:  
  
   |||  
   |-|-|  
   |Field|Value|  
   |Adapter|Use Adapter|  
   |URI|`ExternalApplicationAdapter`|  
   |Type|`ExternalApplicationAdapter.AppAdapter`|  
  
   ![External adapter configuration in Dynamics 365](../unified-service-desk/media/usd-external-adapter-config.PNG "External adapter configuration in Dynamics 365")  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   >  URI is the name of your assembly and the Type is the name of your assembly (dll) followed by a dot (.) and then the class name in your [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio_short](../includes/pn-visual-studio-short.md)] project. In this example, the name of the assembly is `ExternalApplicationAdapter` and name of the class is `AppAdapter`, which is the default class name when you create an application adapter.  
  
6. Click **Save** to save the changes.  
  
<a name="TestAppAdapter"></a>   
## Step 5: Test the application adapter  
  
1. Copy the assembly that contains your application adapter definition from your [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio_short](../includes/pn-visual-studio-short.md)] project output folder (\<ProjectFolder>\bin\debug) to the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] application directory. In this case, we will copy the ExternalApplicationAdapter.dll file to the c:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics CRM USD\USD directory.  
  
2. Run [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client to connect to your [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] server.  
  
3. On successful sign in, you’ll see the sample external application on your desktop.  
  
4. Choose **Search** and then choose **Contacts** and select a contact. In this case, we’ll select `Patrick Sands`.  
  
   ![Contacts list in Unified Service Desk](../unified-service-desk/media/usd-external-app-contacts-list.PNG "Contacts list in Unified Service Desk")  
  
5. Click **Sample External Application** and you’ll see the customer’s first name, last name, address, and ID populated.  
  
   ![Customer info in external application](../unified-service-desk/media/usd-external-app-customer-info.PNG "Customer info in external application")  
  
> [!NOTE]
