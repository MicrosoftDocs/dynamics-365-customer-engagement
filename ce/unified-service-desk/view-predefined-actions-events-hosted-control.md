# View predefined actions and events for a hosted control in Unified Service Desk
Each predefined hosted control type in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] supports a set of UII actions and events. To view the predefined UII actions and events for a hosted control:  
  
1.  Open an existing hosted control or create a hosted control in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]. For information, see [Create or edit a hosted control](../unified-service-desk/create-edit-hosted-control.md).  
  
2.  On the nav bar, click the down arrow next to the hosted control name, and then click **UII Actions** or **Events** to view the predefined UII actions or events for the hosted control.
