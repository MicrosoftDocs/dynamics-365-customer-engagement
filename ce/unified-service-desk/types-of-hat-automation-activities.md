# Types of HAT automation activities in Unified Service Desk
There are various types of [!INCLUDE[pn_hosted_application_toolkit_hat](../includes/pn-hosted-application-toolkit-hat.md)] automation activities that you can use to automate your hosted applications. To view and use the [!INCLUDE[pn_hat](../includes/pn-hat.md)] automation activities, see [Use HAT automation activities](../unified-service-desk/use-hat-automation-activities.md).  
  
<a name="AIF"></a>   
## Application Integration Framework (AIF) action activities  
 Action activities provide functionality to access and manage [UII actions](../unified-service-desk/uii-actions.md). Here are the various action activities available.  
  
 `DoAction`  
 Executes an action either in the same application or in another hosted application. This action has the following properties:  
  
-   `ApplicationName`: The application on which to execute the `DoAction`. Mandatory.  
  
-   `ActionData`: Data required for performing the action. Optional.  
  
- **ActionName** Name of the action that is registered with the hosted application specified in the `ApplicationName` property. Mandatory.  
  
 `GetActionData`  
 Retrieves the data from the action that invoked the workflow or automation. The value will be returned in the `ActionData` property.  
  
 `SetActionData`  
 Adds data to the current action.  
  
 Specify the data that is required for the action in the `ActionData` parameter.  
  
 `RegisterActionForEvent`  
 Registers an action to be initiated every time an event occurs. This action has the following properties:  
  
-   `ActionApplication`: Name of the application with which the UII action is registered. Mandatory.  
  
-   `ActionName`: Name of the action for the application that will be executed when the event is initiated. Mandatory.  
  
-   `ApplicationName`: Name of the application that initiates the event. Mandatory.  
  
-   `ControlName`: Name of the control that initiates the event. Optional.  
  
-   `EventName`: Name of the event initiated by the application/control.  
  
 `UnRegisterActionForEvent`  
 Unregisters an action that was previously registered using the `RegisterActionForEvent` activity. The unregistered event won’t be executed anymore. This action has the following properties:  
  
-   `ActionApplicationName`: Name of the application with which the UII action is registered.  
  
-   `ActionName`: Name of the action for the application that would have executed when the event was initiated.  
  
-   `ApplicationName`: Name of the application that initiates the event.  
  
-   `ControlName`: Name of the control that initiates the event.  
  
-   `EventName`: Name of the event initiated by the application or control.  
  
 `CloseDynamicApp`  
 Closes a dynamic hosted application from within the automation. You can use this action to programmatically close a dynamic hosted application in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)].  
  
 Specify the name of the dynamic hosted application in the `ApplicationName` parameter that you want to close.

 `HostApplication`  
 Hosts the UI of the application. It uses the **Application Hosting** configuration data specified while configuring the hosted control in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] on the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] server to determine the hosting mode. For more information about specifying the hosting mode for an application in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)], see [Create and manage UII hosted applications](../unified-service-desk/create-manage-uii-hosted-applications.md).  
  
<a name="DDA"></a>   
## DDA activities  
 Data-driven adapter (DDA) activities provide access to controls specified in the bindings. Here are the various DDA activities.  
  
 `Audit`  
 Creates audit entries from within the automation. This action has the following properties:  
  
-   `Audit Flag`: Name of the audit flag.  
  
-   `Log data`: Value of the audit flag value.  
  
 For information about various audit flags in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)], see [Configure auditing and diagnostics in Unified Service Desk](../unified-service-desk/admin/configure-auditing-diagnostics-unified-service-desk.md).  
  
 `ControlFinder`  
 Locates a control in the hosted application. The action returns `True` if the control is found in the `ControlFound` property; otherwise, returns `False`. You can set the `ExceptionsMask` property if you want to use the exception handler to execute depending activities. This action has the following properties:  
  
-   `ApplicationName`: Name of the application that hosts the control. Mandatory.  
  
-   `ControlName`: Name of the control in the application.

> [!NOTE]
>  If a workflow that you configured is blocking the UI thread and you have specified SleepInterval and Timeout parameters for the `ControlFinder` activity, the action should be configured to run asynchronously.  
  
 `ExecuteControlAction`  
 Executes the default action of a control. For example, if the control is a button, the default action is click. This action has the following properties:  
  
-   `ApplicationName`: Name of the application that hosts the control.

>  When using the `GetControlValue` activity with a multi-line text control, all new line characters will be ignored and a single string is returned.  
  
 `SetControlValue`  
 Sets the value of a control in the application. This action has the following properties:  
  
-   `ApplicationName`: Name of the application that hosts the control.  
  
-   `ControlName`: Name of the control in the application whose value has to be set.  
  
-   `ControlValue`: Enter the value to be set.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  When using the `SetControlValue` activity with a multi-line text control, all new line characters will be ignored and a single string is returned.  
  
 `Navigate`  
 Specifies a URL that a web application navigates to. For example, you can use the `Navigate` activity to force a web application to navigate to a specific URL when a user performs a task. This action has the following properties:  
  
-   `ApplicationName`: Name of the application that hosts the control.  
  
-   `URL`: Specify the URL along with the query string.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  -   The `Navigate` activity shouldn’t be called concurrently on the web browser. If it is, you’ll receive the following errors:  
>   
>     ```Output  
>     AutomationAdapter (app=Contact,action=__SetControlValue__): Posted implicit action exception:  Microsoft.Uii.HostedApplicationToolkit.DataDrivenAdapter.DataDrivenAdapterException: DDA0301: Web browser is busy and cannot be stopped.   
>   
>     WF/Automation <GUID> exception: Microsoft.Uii.HostedApplicationToolkit.DataDrivenAdapter.DataDrivenAdapterException: DDA0301: Web browser is busy and cannot be stopped.  
>     ```  
> -   For the `Navigate` activity to work on the target application, you must configure the hosted application in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] to use **Automation Adapter (HAT)**, and provide the following binding in the Automation XML field:  
>   
>     ```  
>     <DataDrivenAdapterBindingsCollection>  
>        <DataDrivenAdapterBindings>  
>           <Type>Microsoft.Uii.HostedApplicationToolkit.DataDrivenAdapter.WebDataDrivenAdapter, Microsoft.Uii.HostedApplicationToolkit.DataDrivenAdapter</Type>  
>           <Controls/>  
>        </DataDrivenAdapterBindings>  
>     </DataDrivenAdapterBindingsCollection>  
>     ```  
>   
>      For more information about configuring hosted controls in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)], see [Create and manage UII hosted applications](../unified-service-desk/create-manage-uii-hosted-applications.md).
