# Walkthrough 4: Display a Unified Interface apps record in a session in your agent application



This walkthrough demonstrates how to display records in a session in your agent application using window navigation rules and session controls in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]. It also demonstrates the use of replacement parameters to dynamically display the name of the hosted control based on the currently displayed account record. This walkthrough is built on top of the previous walkthrough, [Walkthrough 3: Display Unified Interface apps records in your agent application](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough3-unified-interface-display-microsoft-dynamics-365-records-in-your-agent-application.md), to display an account record in a session when you select one of the accounts in the **Account** search result window.  
  
## Prerequisites  
  
- You must have completed [Walkthrough 1: Build a simple agent application for Unified Interface app](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough1-unified-interface-build-a-simple-agent-application.md) and [Walkthrough 3: Display Unified Interface apps records in your agent application](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough3-unified-interface-display-microsoft-dynamics-365-records-in-your-agent-application.md). The configurations that you completed in these walkthroughs are required in this walkthrough.  
  
- This walkthrough assumes that you’ll be using the same user credential that you used in walkthrough 1 to sign in to the agent application at the end of the walkthrough to test the application. If a different user will be testing the application, you must assign the user to **Contoso Configuration**.

<a name="Step1"></a>   
## Step 1: Create a session-scoped hosted control to display account record in a session  
 In this step, you’ll create a session-scoped hosted control to display an account record in a session.  
  
1. Sign in to Unified Service Desk Administrator 
  
2. Select **Hosted Controls** under **Basic Settings**.  
  
3. Select **+ New**.  
  
4. On the **New Hosted Control** page, specify the following values:  
  
   |Field|Value|  
   |-----------|-----------|  
   |Name|Contoso Account Session|  
   |Display Name|[[account.name]] <br>**Note:**  We will use replacement parameter to dynamically display the name of the selected account as hosted control display name.|  
   |USD Component Type|Unified Interface Page|  
   |Allow Multiple Pages|No|
   |Pre-Fetch Data|Checked|
   |Application is Global|Not checked <br>**Note:**  This ensures that the hosted control is session-scoped, that is, only displayed in a session.|  
   |Display Group|MainPanel|
  
5. Select **Save**.
  
<a name="Step2"></a>   
## Step 2: Configure the event to close the hosted control from where the search originated  

 In this step, you’ll configure the **PageReady** event on the **Contoso Account Session** hosted control so that when it’s loaded, the parent hosted control from where the user selected to open the account, **Contoso Accounts Search**, is closed. The **Contoso Accounts Search** hosted control was created in [Walkthrough 3: Display Unified Interface apps records in your agent application](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough3-unified-interface-display-microsoft-dynamics-365-records-in-your-agent-application.md). This is done to ensure that the user can’t open other account information in the same session tab.  
  
1. On the **Contoso Account Session** hosted control, select the **Related** tab, and then select **Events**.
  
2. On the events page, select **PageReady**.  
  
3. On the **PageReady** page, select **Add Existing Action Call** in the **Active Actions** area. The **Lookup Records** pane is displayed.  
  
4. Select the search icon, and then select **+ New Action Call**.
  
5. On the **New Action Call** page, specify the following values:  
  
   |Field|Value|  
   |-----------|-----------|  
   |Name|Contoso Action Call: Close Accounts Search|  
   |Hosted Control|Contoso Accounts Search|  
   |Action|Close| 
  
6. Select **Save**.

7. Select the back button on the browser to go back to the **PageReady** event.  

8. Select **Add Existing Action Call**. The **Lookup Records** pane is displayed. 

9. Type **Contoso Action Call: Close Accounts Search** in the search box. Select the record from the list, and then select **Add**. The action call is now added to the **PageReady** event.

10. Select **Save**.
  
<a name="Step3"></a>   
## Step 3: Create a Session Tabs hosted control  

 To display records in sessions in your agent application, an instance of the **Session Tabs** type of hosted control must be configured in your agent application.  
  
1. On the hosted control page, select **+ New**.  
  
2. On the New Hosted Control page, specify the following values:  
  
   |Field|Value|  
   |-----------|-----------|  
   |Name|Contoso Session Tab|  
   |Unified Service Desk Component Type|Session Tabs| 
  
3. Update the XML in the **Extensions XML** field. To learn more, see [Chat indicator XML](session-tabs-hosted-control.md#chat-indicator-xml).
  
4. Select **Save**.
  
<a name="Step4"></a>   
## Step 4: Create a window navigation rule to display the account record in a session  
 In this step, you’ll create a window navigation rule that displays the record in a session when the user selects any of the accounts in the search results window.
  
1. Sign in to Unified Service Desk Administrator.  
  
2. Select **Window Navigation Rules** under **Basic Settings**.  
  
4. Select **+ New**.  
  
5. On the **New Window Navigation Rule** page, specify the following values:  
  
   |Field|Value|  
   |-----------|-----------|  
   |Name|Contoso Account Session Rule|  
   |Order|5|  
   |From|Contoso Accounts Search|
   |Entity|account|  

6. Select the **Result** tab, and specify the following values:

   |Field|Value|  
   |-----------|-----------| 
   |Route Type|In Place|  
   |Destination|Tab|  
   |Action|Create Session|  
   |Target Tab|Contoso Account Session|  
   |Show Tab|Contoso Account Session|  
   |Hide Command Bar|No|  
   |Hide Navigation Bar|Yes|
  
6. Select **Save**.  
  
<a name="Step5"></a>   
## Step 5: Add the controls to the configuration  
 In this step, you’ll add the action call, event, hosted controls, and window navigation rule configured in this walkthrough to **Contoso Configuration** to display these controls to the user who is assigned to the configuration. **Contoso Configuration** was created in [Walkthrough 1: Build a simple agent application](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough1-unified-interface-build-a-simple-agent-application.md).  
  
 Add the following to **Contoso Configuration**:  
  
|Control name|Control type|  
|------------------|------------------|  
|Contoso Action Call: Close Accounts Search|Action call|  
|PageReady|Event for the Contoso Account Session hosted control|  
|Contoso Account Session|Hosted Control|  
|Contoso Session Tab|Hosted Control|  
|Contoso Account Session Rule|Window navigation rule|
  
 To add a control to the configuration:  
  
1. Sign in to Unified Service Desk Administrator.  
  
2. Select **Configuration** under **Advanced Settings**.  
  
3. Select **Contoso Configuration** to open the definition.  
  
4. Select the **Hosted Controls, Events and Action Calls** tab.  

5. Select the ellipsis (...) in the **Action Calls** section, and then select **Add Existing Action Call**. The **Lookup Records** pane is displayed.

6. Type the name of the action call mentioned in the above table in the search box. The action calls are displayed in the search results. Select the record from the list, and then select **Add**.  
  
7. Select the ellipsis (...) in the **Hosted Controls** section, and then select **Add Existing Hosted Control**. The **Lookup Records** pane is displayed.  

8. Type the name of the hosted control mentioned in the above table in the search box. The hosted controls are displayed in the search results. Select the record from the list, and then select **Add**.

9. Select the ellipsis (...) in the **Events** section, and then select **Add Existing Events**. The **Lookup Records** pane is displayed.  

10. Type the name of the event mentioned in the above table in the search box. The event is displayed in the search results. Select the record from the list, and then select **Add**.

11. Select the **Toolbars, Window Navigation Rules and Entity Searches** tab. 

11. Select the ellipsis (...) in the **Window Navigation Rules** section, and then select **Add Existing Window Navigation Rule**. The **Lookup Records** pane is displayed. 

12. Type the name of the Window Navigation Rule mentioned in the above table in the search box. The rule is displayed in the search results. Select the record from the list, and then select **Add**.

## Step 6: Test the application  
  
1. Start the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client application, and sign in to the Dynamics 365 instance where you configured Unified Service Desk by using the same user credentials that is assigned to Contoso Configuration in [Walkthrough 1: Build a simple agent application](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough1-unified-interface-build-a-simple-agent-application.md). For information about connecting to Dataverse instance using the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client application, see [Connect to CRM instance using the Unified Service Desk client](../unified-service-desk/admin/connect-dynamics-365-instance-using-unified-service-desk-client.md).  
  
2. To display the account records from your model-driven app, select the down arrow next to the **Search** button in the toolbar, and then select **Account**.  
  
3. Select any of the account records to display the respective account information in a session; the information is displayed under a session tab. Note that the name of the hosted control tab that contains the account record automatically displays the account name because earlier you used replacement parameters to dynamically display the current account name instead of a static value.  
  
   ![Account record displayed in a session.](../unified-service-desk/media/usd-account-record-session-unified-interface.png "Account record displayed in a session")  
  
4. If you open another account record, it will be displayed in another session in your client application. To open another account, select the down arrow next to the **Search** button, select **Account**, and then select an account name to display the account information in another session.
