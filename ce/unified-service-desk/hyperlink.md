# HyperLink in Unified Service Desk
The `<HyperLink>` element does not define an element on the web application's user interface (UI), but it allows navigating to a specified URL. This element does not use the `DOM` tree to navigate. It only takes the `<Url>` tag to specify the target URL, as shown in the following example:  
  
```xml  
<HyperLink name="control name">  
<Url>https://www.urlgoeshere.org</Url>  
</HyperLink>  
  
```
