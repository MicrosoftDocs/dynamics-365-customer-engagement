# Unified Interface KM Control (Hosted Control)

Use the **Unified Interface KM Control** type of hosted control to display knowledge base articles in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] in your agent application. Using the new hosted control, your service agents can search for articles, associate or disassociate an article with a case, copy a link to an article, and send it through email or in chat without having to switch applications. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Use Dynamics 365 knowledge base for effective customer engagement](../unified-service-desk/use-dynamics-365-knowledge-effective-customer-engagement.md) and [Configure Unified Service Desk to use Dynamics 365 knowledge](../unified-service-desk/configure-unified-service-desk-use-dynamics-365-knowledge.md)

> [!NOTE]
> The Unified Interface KM Control supports all searche techniques available in Dynamics 365 except the **Relevance Search**. More informaiton: [Relevance search for knowledge management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/business-applications-release-notes/October18/service/customer-service-core-release-notes/relevance-search-for-knowledge-management)

## Create a KM Control hosted control  
 While creating a new hosted control, the fields in the **New Hosted Control** screen vary based on the type of hosted control you want to create. This section provides information about the specific fields that are unique to the **Unified Interface KM Control** hosted control type. For detailed information about creating a hosted control, see [Create or edit a hosted control](../unified-service-desk/create-edit-hosted-control.md).  

 ![Unified Interface KM Control hosted control](../unified-service-desk/media/usd-unified-interface-kmcontrolhostedcontrol.png "Unified Interface KM Control hosted control")  

 In the **New Hosted Control** screen:

- Under **Unified Service Desk** area, select **Unified Interface KM Control** from the **USD Component Type** drop-down list.  

- The **Allow Multiple Pages** drop-down list is not supported for this hosted control type.  

- The **Hosting Type** is **IE Process** (default). For more information, see [Select a hosting method for hosted controls](../unified-service-desk/select-a-hosting-method-for-your-controls.md).  

- Under the **Common Properties** area, select the **Application is Global** check box to set the hosted control as global. Global hosted controls can be displayed outside of a customer session. Controls like the agentsâ€™ dashboard, wall or search are common uses for global hosted controls. Global hosted controls do not have session-specific state so when you change sessions, these same global hosted controls remain. If the check box is not selected, the hosted control becomes session based. Session-based controls exist in the context of the customer session. If the user changes to another session, all the session pages from the previous session are hidden.  

- The **Display Group** field displays the panel where this hosted control will be displayed. In the knowledge management package, the Unified Interface KM Control is displayed in the **RighPanel**; however, you can choose to display it in the **LeftPanel** or **MainPanel** as per your requirement. For information about various panels available in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)], see [Panels, panel types, and panel layouts in Unified Service Desk](../unified-service-desk/panels-panel-types-panel-layouts.md).  

  For information about other **General** fields, see [Create or edit a hosted control](../unified-service-desk/create-edit-hosted-control.md).
