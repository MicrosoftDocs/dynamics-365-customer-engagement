# Configure notifications (Screen pops) for agents overview

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

You configure notifications (screen pops) in Unified Service Desk - Omnichannel for Customer Service. These notifications pop up on the screen, and they contain either general information, customer-related or process-related information that the agent can act upon. Here are some examples of the information that screen pops can contain:

- Wait time

- Customer satisfaction score

- Customer/account name

- Job title

- Category

There are two types of notifications:

- Alert notifications

- Toast notification (floating notifications)
