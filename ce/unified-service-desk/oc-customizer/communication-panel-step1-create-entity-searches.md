- You must be familiar with the following concepts in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]:  
  
  - [Unified Service Desk Hosted Controls](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/unified-service-desk/unified-service-desk-hosted-controls)  
  
  - These three types of hosted controls: Connection Manager, Global Manager, and Panel Layout. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Hosted control types, action, and event reference in Unified Service Desk](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/unified-service-desk/hosted-control-types-action-event-reference) 
  
  - Filter access using [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)].
