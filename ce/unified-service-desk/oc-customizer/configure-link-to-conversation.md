# Configure link to conversation button in Unified Service Desk



[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

You accept a conversation request and there is no record in the Omnichannel application linked to this conversation. Now, you create the contact or account record, and you want to link the record to the conversation. This topic describes, as a system customizer, how to configure the link to conversation button for agents using Omnichannel app in Unified Service Desk to link the records.

Consider the following scenario:

- Agent accepts the conversation request
- Agent creates an account record
- Link the record to the conversation

For this scenario, you must create the following:

1. **Create a hosted control:** Communication Panel is the hosted control.
1. **Create a action call:** Link to conversation is the action call.
2. **Create a toolbar and toolbar button:** Link records is the toolbar.
3. **Attach the action call and toolbar:** Link to conversation is the toolbar button.

## Prerequisites
