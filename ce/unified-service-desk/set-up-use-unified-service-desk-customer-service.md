# Set up and use Unified Service Desk for customer service



Give your customer service reps immediate access to business critical information so they can quickly engage with customers and address questions and issues using [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]. [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] gives you a configurable framework to quickly build applications for call centers so agents get a unified view of the customer data stored in Microsoft Dataverse. You can aggregate customer information from different areas in Dataverse into one integrated desktop that provides a 360Â° view of customer interactions. For more information, see [Overview of Unified Service Desk](../unified-service-desk/admin/overview-unified-service-desk.md).
