# Set up and use Unified Service Desk for customer service

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

Give your customer service reps immediate access to business critical information so they can quickly engage with customers and address questions and issues using [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]. [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] gives you a configurable framework to quickly build applications for call centers so agents get a unified view of the customer data stored in Microsoft Dataverse. You can aggregate customer information from different areas in Dataverse into one integrated desktop that provides a 360° view of customer interactions. For more information, see [Overview of Unified Service Desk](../unified-service-desk/admin/overview-unified-service-desk.md).
