# USD Hosted Control (Hosted Control)



Use the **USD Hosted Control** type of hosted control to create custom hosted controls in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]. Microsoft Dataverse provides a [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio](../includes/pn-visual-studio.md)] template for creating a custom [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] hosted control to help you quickly get started with the development. For more information about creating a custom hosted control to extend [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)], see [Create custom Unified Service Desk hosted control](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough-create-custom-hosted-control-for-unified-service-desk.md).  

> [!NOTE]
> When you access a dialog box of a desktop application that is hosted in Unified Service Desk, the dialog box will open as an independent window. You will be able to access the other controls of the Unified Service Desk application.
