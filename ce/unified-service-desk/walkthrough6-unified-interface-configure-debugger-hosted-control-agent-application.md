# Walkthrough 6: Configure the Debugger hosted control in agent applications



[!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] provides a **Debugger** type of hosted control, which provides you key information about your [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] configuration that helps you to successfully build an agent application and troubleshoot issues in your configuration. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Debug issues in Unified Service Desk](../unified-service-desk/debug-issues-unified-service-desk.md )  

 This walkthrough demonstrates how to configure a Debugger hosted control for your agent application.  

## Prerequisites  

- You must have completed [Walkthrough 1: Build a simple agent application for Unified Interface Apps](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough1-unified-interface-build-a-simple-agent-application.md) and [Walkthrough 3: Display Unified Interface apps records in your agent application](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough3-unified-interface-display-microsoft-dynamics-365-records-in-your-agent-application.md). The configurations that you completed in those walkthroughs are required in this walkthrough.  

- This walkthrough assumes that youâ€™ll be using the same user credential that you used in walkthrough 1 to sign in to the agent application at the end of the walkthrough to test the application. If a different user will be testing the application, you must assign the user to **Contoso Configuration**. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Walkthrough 1: Build a simple agent application for Unified Interface Apps](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough1-unified-interface-build-a-simple-agent-application.md)  

- You must know about the following in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]:  

  - Debugger hosted control. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Debugger (Hosted Control)](../unified-service-desk/debugger-hosted-control.md)  

  - Action call and how to configure it. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Action calls](../unified-service-desk/action-calls.md)  

  - Filter access using [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] configuration.

1. Sign in to Unified Service Desk Administrator.  

2. Select **Toolbars** under **Basic Settings**.  

3. Select **Contoso Main Toolbar**.

4. In the **Buttons** area, select **+ New Toolbar Button** to add a toolbar button.  

5. On the **New Toolbar Button** page, specify the following values.  


   |    Field    |                                                                                Value                                                                                 |
   |-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   |    Name     |                                                                       Contoso Debugger Button                                                                        |

<a name="Step3"></a>   
## Step 3: Add the controls to the configuration  
 Add the action call and hosted control that you created in this walkthrough to **Contoso Configuration** to display these controls to the user who is assigned to the configuration. **Contoso Configuration** was created in [Walkthrough 1: Build a simple agent application for Unified Interface Apps](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough1-unified-interface-build-a-simple-agent-application.md).  

 Add the following to **Contoso Configuration**.  

|Control name|Control type|  
|------------------|------------------|  
|Contoso Action Call: Show Debugger|Action Call|  
|Contoso Debugger|Hosted Control|  

 To add a control to the configuration:  

1. Sign in to Unified Service Desk Administrator. 

2. Select **Configuration** under **Advanced Settings**.  

3. Select **Contoso Configuration** to open the definition.  

4. Select the **Hosted Controls, Events and Action Calls** tab.  

5. Select the ellipsis (...) in the **Action Calls** section, and then select **Add Existing Action Call**. The **Lookup Records** pane is displayed.

6. Type the name of the action call mentioned in the above table in the search box. The action calls are displayed in the search results. Select the record from the list, and then select **Add**.  

7. Select the ellipsis (...) in the **Hosted Controls** section, and then select **Add Existing Hosted Control**. The **Lookup Records** pane is displayed.  

8. Type the name of the hosted control mentioned in the above table in the search box. The hosted controls are displayed in the search results. Select the record from the list, and then select **Add**. 

9. Select **Save**.  

<a name="Step4"></a>   
## Step 4: Test the application  
 Start the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client application, and sign in to the Dynamics 365 instance where you configured [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] using the same user credentials that you assigned to the **Contoso Configuration** in [Walkthrough 1: Build a simple agent application for Unified Interface Apps](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough1-unified-interface-build-a-simple-agent-application.md). For information about connecting to Dataverse instance using the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client application, see [Connect to a model-driven app instance using the Unified Service Desk client](admin/connect-dynamics-365-instance-using-unified-service-desk-client.md).  

 Your agent application will now have a **DEBUGGER** button in the toolbar area. Selecting this button displays the Debugger control.
