# WebDDA
The Web data-driven adapter (WebDDA) provides access to HTML-based applications. The key technology used in this data-driven adapter is the Document Object Model (DOM) of the browser. The bindings are created in a way similar to those for the WinDDA, by defining a key element and the path-through, in this case the DOM, to the element.  
  
 The various WebDDA binding elements are as follows:  
  
-   [AnchorElement](../unified-service-desk/anchor-element.md)  
  
-   [ButtonElement](../unified-service-desk/button-element.md)  
  
-   [InputElement](../unified-service-desk/input-element.md)  
  
-   [SelectElement](../unified-service-desk/select-element.md)  
  
-   [TextAreaElement](../unified-service-desk/text-area-element.md)  
  
-   [HtmlElement](../unified-service-desk/html-element.md)  
  
-   [HyperLink](../unified-service-desk/hyperlink.md)  
  
-   [Search Path Elements](../unified-service-desk/search-path-elements.md)  
  
-   [AttributeMatchPath](../unified-service-desk/attribute-match-path.md)  
  
-   [ElementMatchPath](../unified-service-desk/element-match-path.md)  
  
-   [FindIEFrame](../unified-service-desk/find-ie-frame.md)  
  
-   [WebDDA Events](../unified-service-desk/web-dda-events.md)
