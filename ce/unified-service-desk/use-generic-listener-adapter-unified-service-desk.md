# Use the generic listener adapter in Unified Service Desk
[!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] provides a generic listener adapter that can be used as a testing tool for integrating [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] with the [!INCLUDE[pn_computer_telephony_integration_cti](../includes/pn-computer-telephony-integration-cti.md)] middleware applications that have the ability to open a URL on the user's computer when a [!INCLUDE[pn_cti_acronym](../includes/pn-cti-acronym.md)] event occurs. The generic listener adapter listens for HTTP request on a known port (5000): `http://localhost:5000/`  

<a name="How"></a>   

## How the generic listener adapter works
 The generic listener adapter extracts a query string from the URL, uses the values in the string as parameters to evaluate them as a [!INCLUDE[pn_cti_acronym](../includes/pn-cti-acronym.md)] event, and then raises a [!INCLUDE[pn_cti_acronym](../includes/pn-cti-acronym.md)] screen pop in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]. Once the adapter starts listening on the specified port, it waits for the [!INCLUDE[pn_cti_acronym](../includes/pn-cti-acronym.md)] middleware to open a URL such as:  

```  
http://localhost:5000/?ani=1234&dnis=4355&type=phonecall&customerid=49383433  
```  

 In the example URL, the query string is split out and passed to the Global Manager hosted control in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] as the following parameters.  


|     Parameter |  Description    | Values in the example URL |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------|
|       `ANI`       |   Stands for *automatic number identification*. This is the phone number of the incoming call.                                                                                                                                            |        `ani=1234`         |
|      `DNIS`       |                                                                                                                                       Stands for *dialed number identification service*. This is the phone number that the customer called.                                                                                                                                       |        `dnis=4355`        |
|      `Type`       | This is corresponding to the **Initiating Activity** information in your window navigation rule to route the call, and take appropriate actions. Common values include `phonecall` and `chat`. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [CTI search](../unified-service-desk/consideration-creating-cti-adapter-unified-service-desk.md#CTISearch) |     `type=phonecall`      |
| `Key=value pairs` |                                                                                                                    A collection of key-value pairs that enables the Global Manager hosted control to raise a `CTILookUpRequest` to search the customer record.                                                                                                                    |   `customerid=49383433`   |

 For [!INCLUDE[pn_cti_acronym](../includes/pn-cti-acronym.md)] searches, each of these parameters may be used as replacement parameters. Once a session starts, these parameters can be accessed with the `cti` prefix such as:  

```  
[[cti.ani]]  
```  

 To view a walkthrough that demonstrates the usage of the generic listener adapter for handling [!INCLUDE[pn_cti_acronym](../includes/pn-cti-acronym.md)] events, see [Walkthrough: Use generic listener adapter for CTI events](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough-use-the-generic-listener-adapter-for-cti-event-routing.md).  

<a name="Configure"></a>   
## Configure the CTI Desktop Manager hosted control for generic listener adapter  
 When using the generic listener adapter, you only have to configure the CTI Desktop Manager component; the [!INCLUDE[pn_cti_acronym](../includes/pn-cti-acronym.md)] connector and the [!INCLUDE[pn_cti_acronym](../includes/pn-cti-acronym.md)] control arenâ€™t required. The CTI Desktop Manager hosted control should be configured to be placed on a `HiddenPanel`, and the following standard values apply for the generic listener adapter in the hosted control configuration page in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]:  

- **Assembly URI**: Microsoft.Crm.UnifiedServiceDesk.GenericListener  

- **Assembly Type**: Microsoft.Crm.UnifiedServiceDesk.GenericListener.

  For detailed information about configuring a CTI Desktop Manager hosted control in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)], see [Configure CTI Desktop Manager hosted control in Unified Service Desk](../unified-service-desk/create-cti-desktop-manager.md#Configure).  

<a name="ChangePort"></a>   
## Change the port of generic listener  
 By default, the generic listener adapter listens for HTTP request on port 5000: `http://localhost:5000/`.  

 You can use the **Options** setting in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] to define a different port for the generic listener, if required. To do so:

1. Sign in to Unified Service Desk Administrator.

2. Select **Options** under **Advanced Settings**.

3. Select **New** to add a new option.  

4. Type the following values in the fields:  

   |Field|Value|  
   |-----------|-----------|  
   |Name|GenericListener|  
   |Value|Specify the new URL for the listener. For example: `http://localhost:5001/`|

5. Select **Save & Close**.
