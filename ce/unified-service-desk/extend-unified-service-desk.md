# Extend Unified Service Desk

## Overview of extensibility
This section provides information on how you can use the [!INCLUDE[pn_user_inteface_integration_uii](../includes/pn-user-interface-integration-uii.md)] components to extend [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] to integrate with external applications, web applications, and [!INCLUDE[pn_computer_telephony_integration_cti](../includes/pn-computer-telephony-integration-cti.md)] systems. It also provides information on how to customize [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] by developing custom hosted controls and panel layouts.

 [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] provides you with a host of [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio](../includes/pn-visual-studio.md)] project templates that you can use to create a [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)] application adapter, a [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)] web adapter, a [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)] customer search control (Windows Forms and [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Windows_Presentation_Foundation](../includes/pn-ms-windows-presentation-foundation.md)]), a [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)] hosted control (Windows Forms and [!INCLUDE[pn_wpf_acronym](../includes/pn-wpf-acronym.md)]), a [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)][!INCLUDE[pn_cti_acronym](../includes/pn-cti-acronym.md)] adapter, a custom [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] hosted control, and a custom panel layout.

 You can get the project templates by [downloading](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=400925) the **CRM SDK Templates** from the Visual Studio gallery, and double-clicking the CRMSDKTemplates.vsix file to install the templates in [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio_short](../includes/pn-visual-studio-short.md)].

> [!NOTE]
>  The templates work with [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_visual_studio_2012](../includes/pn-microsoft-visual-studio-2012.md)], [!INCLUDE[pn_visual_studio_2013](../includes/pn-visual-studio-2013.md)], or [!INCLUDE[pn_visual_studio_2015](../includes/pn-visual-studio-2015.md)]. Additionally, you must have [!INCLUDE[tn_nuget_package_manager](../includes/tn-nuget-package-manager.md)] for [Visual Studio 2012](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/27077b70-9dad-4c64-adcf-c7cf6bc9970c), [Visual Studio 2013](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/4ec1526c-4a8c-4a84-b702-b21a8f5293ca), or [Visual Studio 2015](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/5d345edc-2e2d-4a9c-b73b-d53956dc458d).

 For information about the [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)] concepts that you must know to extend [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)], see [Unified Service Desk and the UII framework](../unified-service-desk/unified-service-desk-uii-framework.md).
