# Use window navigation rules in Unified Service Desk
Window navigation rules define the interaction between various controls in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]. You can use the rules to define the location of the sessions or the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] pages to appear in the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client application when invoked from a hosted control or an entity search. For more information about hosted controls and entity searches in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)], see [Unified Service Desk Hosted Controls](../unified-service-desk/unified-service-desk-hosted-controls.md) and [Search data using entity searches in Unified Service Desk](../unified-service-desk/search-data-entity-searches.md).  

 Window navigation rules in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] are executed in the numerical order and as per the conditions specified. The order is particularly important when more than one rule applies to the conditions under which the control might appear. For example, it is possible to create default handlers that will match when no other rules apply. Such default handlers must come after the more specific handlers, otherwise, the specific handlers will never get used.

## Create or edit a window navigation rule  
 To create or edit window navigation rules:  

1. Sign in to your [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] sever.  

2. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_usd](../includes/proc-settings-usd.md)]  

3. Click **Windows Navigation Rules**. The page displays all the existing navigation rules in the system.  

   ![Windows navigation rules](../unified-service-desk/media/usd-windows-navigation-rules.PNG "Windows navigation rules")  

4. On the window navigation rules page:  

   1.  To create a new navigation rule, click or tap **NEW** on the command bar.  

   2.  To edit an existing navigation rule, either click on the navigation rule name or select the navigation rule record in the list, and then click **EDIT** on the command bar.    
5. On the navigation rule definition page, specify or modify the following values if you are creating a new navigation rule or editing an existing navigation rule respectively. Fields marked with red asterisk are mandatory.

When you want to access data that is not displayed on the form, you can use entity searches. When an entity search completes and returns data, the **OnLoad** routing type rule are executed to allow you to load related entities. For more information about entity searches, see [Search data using entity searches in Unified Service Desk](../unified-service-desk/search-data-entity-searches.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

This field is used instead of the **Entity** field, but can be used with the **Entity** field in certain circumstances. An asterisk (*) in this field is used to create a default rule that applies to any pop-up windows originating from the \*\*From*\* field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
   |     Route Type      |         - **Popup**: Used to determine how to handle a pop-up window.<br />- **OnLoad**: Used to determine how to handle an entity search, [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] page, or external Web page after it is loaded.<br />- **In Place**: Used to determine how to handle an in-place transition or loading of [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] form. For example, when you click on the contact name in an account page in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], the contact information is loaded in the same frame where the account information was displayed.<br />- **Menu Chosen**: Used to determine how to handle the selection of a menu item, when the user clicks the down arrow next to a record name in the nav bar, and selects an item from the menu list. For example, when you click the drop-down arrow next to an account name on the nav bar of the account page in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] to select an item such as **Contacts**, **Opportunities**, and **Cases**.          |
   |       Action        | - **Create Session**: Only applies to a **Popup** route type. This action will load a session based upon the entity contained in the popup. For example, if the **From** is set to `Queues`, **Entity** is set to `incident`, **Route Type** is set to `Popup`, and **Action** is set to `Create Session`, double clicking an incident in the queue will create a session and load the popup in a tab identified in the **Target Tab** field.<br />- **Route Window**: Direct the window to another tab within the same session. This is the most basic form of routing of windows.<br />- **Show Outside**: When this rule matches, the pop-up window will appear outside the client application. This new window will not be under the control of Unified Service Desk any longer and will not participate in the Unified Service Desk session management. This is useful for displaying a window on a second monitor or for comparing a window against another tab or a window in another [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] session.<br />- **None**: No action is performed. |

It enables the **Target Tab** and **Show Tab** fields.<br />- **Entity Search**: The item selected in the route type should target an entity search to look up the data using a web service call to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. This populates the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] data so it can be used in replacement parameters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

If the target tab (hosted control) is a dynamic control, it will automatically be loaded and the window will be directed to it. If this field is set to the **Global Manager** and the **Action** is **Create Session**, the system will re-evaluate the rules to determine the actual location of the window in the tabs. This is useful to avoid creating a **Create Session** rule for every route type that might pop up from a particular window. If you leave the **Target Tab** field empty, an entity search is performed using first entity search matching the type of entity from the popup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

6. Click **Save** to create or modify the window navigation rule.

To see how window navigation rules are used for configuring and agent application, see [Walkthrough 4: Display a Microsoft Dynamics 365 record in a session in your agent application](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough-display-dynamics-365-record-session-agent-application.md), [Walkthrough 7: Configure agent scripting in your agent application](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough-configure-agent-scripting-agent-application.md), and [Walkthrough: Use a generic listener adapter for CTI events](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough-use-the-generic-listener-adapter-for-cti-event-routing.md).

## View sample window navigation rules  
 You can view the definition of the existing window navigation rules in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] to understand how to manage navigation within the agent application. To view a navigation rule definition:  

1. Sign in to your [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] sever.  

2. On the nav bar, click or tap **Microsoft Dynamics 365**, and then select **Settings**.  

3. On the nav bar, click or tap **Settings** > **Unified Service Desk** > **Window Navigation Rules**. The page displays all the existing navigation rules in the system.  

4. On the navigation rules page, either click the navigation rule name or select the navigation rule record in the list, and then click **EDIT** on the command bar.  

    This displays the window navigation rule definition.
