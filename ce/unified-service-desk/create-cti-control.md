# Create a CTI Control
To manage agent states and call states, [!INCLUDE[pn_computer_telephony_integration_cti](../includes/pn-computer-telephony-integration-cti.md)] scenarios require the following user interface (UI) controls:  

- **Agent state management control**: Displays the current state of the agent within a [!INCLUDE[pn_user_inteface_integration_uii](../includes/pn-user-interface-integration-uii.md)] desktop (such as [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]. This control doesn’t need to be tied to the [!INCLUDE[pn_cti_acronym](../includes/pn-cti-acronym.md)] system, but it allows you to map [!INCLUDE[pn_cti_acronym](../includes/pn-cti-acronym.md)] agent states with the current agent state, which is the visual state of the agent desktop.  

- **Call control**: Provides buttons that the agent can use to make a call, answer a call, put a call on hold, transfer a call to another agent, or hang up.  

  Both of these controls are normal [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)] hosted controls that inherit from either the [HostedControl](/dotnet/api/microsoft.uii.csr.hostedcontrol) or [HostedWpfControl](/dotnet/api/microsoft.uii.csr.aif.hostedapplication.hostedwpfcontrol) class. You can also choose to merge both the controls into a single [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)] hosted control. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Use UII hosted controls with Unified Service Desk](../unified-service-desk/use-uii-hosted-controls-unified-service-desk.md)  

## Interfaces for implementing a CTI Control  
 Use the following interfaces to implement the user interface of a CTI Control.  

### ICtiAgentStateControl  
 The [ICtiAgentStateControl](/dotnet/api/microsoft.uii.desktop.cti.core.ictiagentstatecontrol) interface is a specialized interface for describing a hosted control that is used for processing and/or displaying agent state information. This interface contains the [Boolean)](/dotnet/api/microsoft.uii.desktop.cti.core.ictiagentstatecontrol.setagentstate) method that’s used to set the state of an agent.  

### IDesktopUserActionsConsumer  
 The [IDesktopUserActionsConsumer](/dotnet/api/microsoft.uii.desktop.core.idesktopuseractionsconsumer) interface is not specific to [!INCLUDE[pn_cti_acronym](../includes/pn-cti-acronym.md)], but it is typically used by the CTI Controls to provide access to desktop operations. It has two members:  

- [DesktopLoadingComplete](/dotnet/api/microsoft.uii.desktop.core.idesktopuseractionsconsumer.desktoploadingcomplete): Raised when the desktop has completed loading. This is raised in a separate thread from the main desktop UI thread.  

- [IDesktopUserActions)](/dotnet/api/microsoft.uii.desktop.core.idesktopuseractionsconsumer.setdesktopuseractionsaccess): Used by the desktop loader to set a pointer to itself in the hosted control that implemented the [ICtiEnabledControlConsumer](/dotnet/api/microsoft.uii.desktop.cti.core.ictienabledcontrolconsumer) interface. It is the pointer to the desktop interface (shell).  

  By implementing this interface, you get access to all user actions, as shown in the following example.  

```  
bool AppExistsInUI(string applicationName);  
bool CloseDynamicApplication(string applicationName);  
bool CloseSession();  
bool CloseSession(Session sessionToClose);  
bool CreateDynamicApplication(string applicationName);  
WorkflowData GetCurrentWorkflowState();  
bool SetFocusOnApplication(string applicationName);  
string UserDefinedCommand(string command, string request);  

```  

### ICtiEnabledControlConsumer  
 The [ICtiEnabledControlConsumer](/dotnet/api/microsoft.uii.desktop.cti.core.ictienabledcontrolconsumer) interface describes a hosted control that will accept pointers to the [CtiCallStateManager](/dotnet/api/microsoft.uii.desktop.cti.core.cticallstatemanager) and the [CtiAgentStateManager](/dotnet/api/microsoft.uii.desktop.cti.core.ctiagentstatemanager).  

 This interface has method definitions to perform following functions:  

- [Object)](/dotnet/api/microsoft.uii.desktop.cti.core.ictienabledcontrolconsumer.setmanagers): Called by UII when a control that implements this interface is initialized.  

- [SessionControllerEventArgs)](/dotnet/api/microsoft.uii.desktop.cti.core.ictienabledcontrolconsumer.sessioncloseevent): Called by UII when a session is closing.  

  The [ICtiEnabledControlConsumer](/dotnet/api/microsoft.uii.desktop.cti.core.ictienabledcontrolconsumer) interface uses the [IsManagersSet](/dotnet/api/microsoft.uii.desktop.cti.core.ictienabledcontrolconsumer.ismanagersset) property to set or get whether the [Object)](/dotnet/api/microsoft.uii.desktop.cti.core.ictienabledcontrolconsumer.setmanagers) method has been called successfully.

## Configure the CTI Control hosted control in Unified Service Desk  

1. Sign in to Unified Service Desk Administrator.  

2. Select **Hosted Controls** under **Basic Settings**.  

3. Select **+ New**.  

4. On the **New Hosted Control** page, specify the following values:
