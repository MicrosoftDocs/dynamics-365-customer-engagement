# Global Manager (Hosted Control)
The **Global Manager** hosted control type is the core of [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)], and an instance of this hosted control is required by [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]. This hosted control loads and reads all the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] configuration data from [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] at application startup, interprets the window navigation rules, provides data to the toolbar components and agent scripts, and manages the data for the session. Only a single instance of the **Global Manager** hosted control type can be loaded.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The three sample application packages for [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)], `New Environment`, `CRM Web Client`, and `Interactive Service Hub`, come preconfigured with an instance each of the **Global Manager** hosted control type. For information about the sample applications, see [Deploy sample Unified Service Desk applications to CRM server using Package Deployer](admin/deploy-sample-unified-service-desk-applications-using-package-deployer.md).  

 In addition to providing interpretation for most of the functions in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)], the **Global Manager** hosted control type also provides the multi-language features in the system so that you can localize UI strings and messages in your application in multiple languages. For more information, see [Add multilanguage support for your agent applications](../unified-service-desk/add-multilanguage-support-agent-applications.md). It also provides the search provider, which is designed to be generic and adaptable through configuration.  

<a name="CreateGlobal"></a>   
## Create a Global Manager hosted control  
 While creating a new hosted control, the fields in the **New Hosted Control** screen vary based on the type of hosted control you want to create. This section provides information about the specific fields that are unique to the **Global Manager** hosted control type. For detailed information about creating a hosted control, see [Create or edit a hosted control](../unified-service-desk/create-edit-hosted-control.md).  

 ![Global Manager hosted control](../unified-service-desk/media/crm-itpro-usd-globalmanagerhostedcontrol.PNG "Global Manager hosted control")  

 In the **New Hosted Control** screen, under the **Unified Service Desk** area, select **Global Manager** from the **USD Component Type** drop-down list. Also, ensure that you set the **Sort Order** value of this hosted control to **2** to ensure it is loaded by your agent application immediately *after* the connection has been established to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] using the Connection Manager hosted control. For information about other **General** fields, see [Create or edit a hosted control](../unified-service-desk/create-edit-hosted-control.md).  

 After you save the record, the **Language Services** area becomes available where you add resources for adding localized strings for your agent application’s UI. For information about how to add language resources, see [Add multilanguage support for your agent applications](../unified-service-desk/add-multilanguage-support-agent-applications.md).  

<a name="predefined"></a>   
## Predefined UII actions  
 Global Manager provides a series of predefined actions that allow you to manipulate [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] record data through the web services. These can be used during configuration to perform advanced functions in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)].  

 The following predefined UII actions are available for the **Global Manager** hosted control type:  

<a name="Audit"></a>   
### Audit  
 Add an audit entry to the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] audit logs. For more information, see [Configure auditing in Unified Service Desk](admin/configure-auditing-diagnostics-unified-service-desk.md)  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|Name|The audit entry name. You must add an option under the **Options** area (**Settings** > **Unified Service Desk** > Options ([How do I get there?](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=525636))) with the value set to **1**.|  
|Action|String representing the action that is being audited.|

|ActionData|This is the data to write out to the audit entry. If this parameter isn’t explicitly provided, it will use all the remainder lines in the **Data** field of the action call definition.|  

<a name="CallDoAction"></a>   
### CallDoAction  
 Calls an action on another hosted control.  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|panel|This is the panel to find the active application, if no application is specified.|  
|action|This is the action to call on the hosted control.|  
|data|This is the data parameter to pass to the action.|  
|application|This is the hosted control name for which you want to execute an action call. If this is specified, the **panel** parameter is ignored.|  

<a name="ClearAppBar"></a>   
### ClearAppBar  
 Undocks the specified hosted control in the client application.  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|ApplicationName|Name of the hosted control to undocked. If this parameter is not supplied, the client application main window is undocked.|  

<a name="ClearEntityList"></a>   
### ClearEntityList  
 Clears the list of accumulated search results, and should always be called before calling the **DoSearch** action  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|global|`True` if you want the search results tied to the global session to be cleared. You must be careful while storing search results in the global session as these are not automatically cleared by the system. In this case, you must call the **ClearEntityList** action before calling the **DoSearch** action.|  

<a name="Close"></a>   
### Close  
 Closes the hosted control. Unlike the [CloseActive](#CloseActive) action, if this tab is displaying more than one page, it will close all the pages displayed in the tab in your agent application.  

<a name="CloseActive"></a>   
### CloseActive  
 Closes the active hosted control on the specified panel.  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
||The first line in the action call should contain the name of the panel to locate the active application. If no parameter is specified, MainPanel is assumed.|  

### CopyToClipboard  
 Copies or appends the article URL to Clipboard.  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|data|Data that you want to be copied. You can also use replacement parameters. For example:  `data=[[$context.title]]`|  
|append|Indicates whether or not to append the data to the Clipboard. Set `true` or `false`. For example: `append=false`.|  

<a name="CopyToContext"></a>   
### CopyToContext  
 Copies a value or series of values to context variables. Context variables can be serialized with the session. This action takes a series of name=value pairs. The name is the name of the context variable.  

### CopyLogicalEntityToContext  
 Copies values from an entire section of the data parameters to the context.  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|LogicalName|The type or section of data parameters to copy values from.|  

<a name="CloseActivity"></a>   
### CloseActivity  
 Closes an activity record in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)].  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|Id|The GUID of the activity record to close.|  
|LogicalName|The logical name of the activity to close.|  
|StatusCode|The display name of the final status code after the activity is closed.|  
|StateCode|The display name of the final state code after the activity is closed.|  

 For example, to close a phone call activity, you must specify the following:  

```  
Id=<GUID of the phone activity record>  

LogicalName=phonecall  

statuscode=Received  

statecode=Completed  
```  

 After the activity record is closed, the [$Return](../unified-service-desk/replacement-parameters.md#Return) system replacement parameter will be populated with a Boolean value indicating whether the action was successful.  

<a name="CreateEntity"></a>   
### CreateEntity

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|`LogicalName`|The logical name of the entity to create the record.| 
|`RunAsync`|Set this to **True** to create the entity record asynchronously so that Unified Service Desk is not blocked and remains responsive during the action execution.<br/><br/>**Note**: The associated sub-action calls and subsequent action calls for the **CreateEntity** action do not wait for the asynchronous create operation to complete. So, you must ensure that if you are running the **CreateEntity** action asynchronously, the sub-action calls that depend on the created record are configured to execute only when the target record is complete. This can be achieved using the **ExecuteOnDataAvailable** action on the Global Manager hosted control.| 

 Each subsequent line in the parameter list contains a series of Name=Value pairs that will define your other fields to populate on create.  

 Entity References can be described like the following:  

```  
Param=EntityReference(“logicalname”, “id”)  
```  

 OptionSetValues can be specified like the following:  

```  
Param=OptionSetValue(value)  
```  

 Booleans can be described like the following:  

```  
Param=Boolean(value)  
```  

 PartyList (used with email) can be described like the following:  

```  
Param=PartyList(email[“test@test.com”], er[“contact”, guid])  
```  

 You can use any number of `email` and `er` entries to represent email addresses and entity references respectively.  

 Other values such as string values can be specified like the following:  

```  
Param=value  
```  

 Once the record is created, the $Return value will be populated with the GUID of the newly created record.  

<a name="CreateSession"></a>   
### CreateSession  
 Creates a session.  

<a name="DeleteEntity"></a>

 Calls the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] web services using the FetchXML defined as an entity search in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] For more information about defining an entity search, see [Search data using entity searches in Unified Service Desk](../unified-service-desk/search-data-entity-searches.md).  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|name|The name of the entity search to be used for searching the record.|  
|global|`True` if you want the search results tied to the global session to be cleared. You must be careful while storing search results in the global session as these are not automatically cleared by the system. In this case, you must call the **ClearEntityList** action before calling this action.|  
|maxcount|The maximum number of records to store in the EntityList results from this call.|  

> [!NOTE]
>  By default, the page count (number of records per page) for a   result set is set to 50. This implies that if there are more than 50 records returned, it will be displayed in pages. If you want to specify a different page count value for the `DoSearch` action, specify the new value in the **EntitySearchPageCount** option. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Manage Options for Unified Service Desk](admin/manage-options-unified-service-desk.md)
