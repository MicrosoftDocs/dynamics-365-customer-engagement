# Unified Service Desk and Unified Interface App configuration walkthroughs
Each walkthrough in this section covers an area or a combination of areas in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk_for_crm](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk-for-crm.md)]. These walkthroughs are arranged in increasing order of complexity so it may benefit you to do them in sequence. Also, you must complete [Walkthrough 1: Build a simple agent application](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough-1-build-a-simple-agent-application.md) first because it sets up the base application that the other walkthroughs.  
  
 These walkthroughs are created using the “New Environment” sample application package deployed on an online instance of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]. Before you begin these walkthroughs, ensure that you have deployed one of the sample [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] applications, have installed the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client application, and have appropriate security access in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] to configure [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] entities.
