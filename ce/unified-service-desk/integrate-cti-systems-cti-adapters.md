# Integrate Unified Service Desk with CTI systems using CTI adapters
To integrate [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] with your [!INCLUDE[pn_computer_telephony_integration_cti](../includes/pn-computer-telephony-integration-cti.md)] system, use a [!INCLUDE[pn_cti_acronym](../includes/pn-cti-acronym.md)] adapter. The [!INCLUDE[pn_user_inteface_integration_uii](../includes/pn-user-interface-integration-uii.md)][!INCLUDE[pn_cti_acronym](../includes/pn-cti-acronym.md)] framework has components that you can use to build a [!INCLUDE[pn_cti_acronym](../includes/pn-cti-acronym.md)] adapter. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [UII CTI Framework Components](../unified-service-desk/uii-computer-telephony-integration-cti-framework.md#Architecture).  
  
 You can create two types of [!INCLUDE[pn_cti_acronym](../includes/pn-cti-acronym.md)] adapters for [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]:  
  
-   The first type involves defining a *CTI Desktop Manager* component with the required telephony actions for call and agent state management that can communicate with your [!INCLUDE[pn_cti_acronym](../includes/pn-cti-acronym.md)] system. Next, you configure it as a **CTI Desktop Manager** type of hosted control in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)], which enables you to handle the interpretation of requests from a [!INCLUDE[pn_cti_acronym](../includes/pn-cti-acronym.md)] system, and then route it within [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)].  
  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] provides a generic listener adapter that you can use to test your [!INCLUDE[pn_cti_acronym](../includes/pn-cti-acronym.md)] system by sending [!INCLUDE[pn_cti_acronym](../includes/pn-cti-acronym.md)] requests on a port with standard parameters that [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] can evaluate as a [!INCLUDE[pn_cti_acronym](../includes/pn-cti-acronym.md)] event. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Using the generic listener adapter in Unified Service Desk](../unified-service-desk/use-generic-listener-adapter-unified-service-desk.md)  
  
-   The second type of adapter involves building all the components of a [!INCLUDE[pn_cti_acronym](../includes/pn-cti-acronym.md)] adapter from scratch where you define how to connect to your [!INCLUDE[pn_cti_acronym](../includes/pn-cti-acronym.md)] system (*CTI Connector*), how the calls and agent states will be managed (*CTI Desktop Manager*), and the look and feel of your softphone (*CTI Controls*). This type of adapter is used if your CTI system uses a service-based polling system or uses a callback/event notification system.
