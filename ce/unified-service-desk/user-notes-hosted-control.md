# User Notes (Hosted Control)
Use **User Notes** hosted control type to provide agents with a scratch pad to type notes during an interaction. Language specific spell checking can be applied to this component by calling the **SetLanguage** action. This component does not automatically pick up the current language of the user, by design. The ability to change the language used is intended to provide the ability to set the language appropriate for the transaction. For example, consider there is a bilingual agent that can speak English and Spanish. The IVR may pass the language selection from the phone system to the agent applicationâ€™s CTI adapter. This language selection can then be used to set the spell check language for this hosted control.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This hosted control does not automatically populate replacement parameters. The [UpdateReplacementParameters](#UpdateReplacementParameters) action can be called to take the current notes and populate the replacement parameters. The replacement parameters can be used to copy the notes to the case.
