# Configure the hosted application
After you create the hosted application (see [Create a HAT hosted application project](../unified-service-desk/use-hat-software-factory-create-hosted-application.md#Create)) you’ll want to configure it.  

1. Open the project in [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio_short](../includes/pn-visual-studio-short.md)].  

2. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the project name, and select **Application Configuration**.  

   ![Use the shortcut menu to configure](../unified-service-desk/media/usd-create-hat-control-11.png "Use the shortcut menu to configure")  

3. In the **Application Properties** dialog box, specify the required information. The following table describes the various application properties.  


   |                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

   | Application Hosting Mode | There are three modes of hosting an application:<br /><br /> 1. **Host Outside** – Allows the application to be started outside of **Unified Service Desk**<br />2. **Use SetParent** – Sets the application’s root window as the child window of **Unified Service Desk**.<br />3. **Use Dynamic Positioning** – Monitors the size and position of the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] application and dynamically adjusts the size and position of the application. |
