# Import hosted application from Unified Service Desk
A hosted application can be imported from [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] to your [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio_short](../includes/pn-visual-studio-short.md)] project.  
  
1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the solution and select **Import**.  
  
2. In the import dialog, enter the Common Data platform server name and your credentials.  
    
3. If there’s more than one organization, select the **Display list of available organizations** check box and click **Login**.  
  
4. Select your organization from the list.  
  
5. From the list of hosted applications, select the one that you want and choose **Import**. In this case, it’s StandAloneTestApp.
