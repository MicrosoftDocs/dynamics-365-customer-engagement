# Debugger (Hosted Control)
Use **Debugger** hosted control type in Unified Service Desk to configure a debugger control in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] to provide you with insights about the process and code executions in the agent application. All the three sample applications in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] come with a preconfigured Debugger hosted control. For more information, see [Debug issues in Unified Service Desk](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=518149) in the Unified Service Desk Administration Guide.
