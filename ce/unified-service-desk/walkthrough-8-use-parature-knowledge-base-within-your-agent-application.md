# Walkthrough 8: Use Customer Engagement knowledge base within your agent application
This walkthrough demonstrates how to configure a panel in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] using the **KM Control** hosted control that displays knowledge base records from your [!INCLUDE[pn_parature](../includes/pn-parature.md)] instance that is integrated with your [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] instance.  
  
 In this walkthrough, you’ll:  
  
-   Display knowledge base articles from [!INCLUDE[pn_parature](../includes/pn-parature.md)] to appear in a search panel in context with your currently open case record in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]. Users can filter and sort the results based on various criteria. Moreover, the search panel automatically appears when you open a case session, and automatically hides when you close the session.  
  
-   Display the article in a tab when you choose the article title in the search panel.  
  
-   Configure contextual actions for the article in the tab where it is displayed, such as copy an article link or associate an article with the current case.

## Step 1: Create a hosted control of type KM Control  
 In this step, you’ll create a hosted control of type **KM Control** to display the knowledge base search pane.  
  
1.  Sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].  
  
2. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_usd](../includes/proc-settings-usd.md)]  
  
3.  Click **Hosted Controls**.  
  
4.  Click **New**.  
  
5.  On the **New Hosted Control** page, specify the following values.  
  
    |Field|Value|  
    |-----------|-----------|  
    |Name|Sample KB Search|  
    |Display Name|Sample KB Search|  
    |USD Component Type|KM Control|  
    |Allow Multiple Pages|No|  
    |Hosting Type|Internal WPF|  
    |Application is Global|Checked|  
    |Display Group|RightPanel|  
  
 ![Create a KM Control hosted control](../unified-service-desk/media/usd-createkmcontrol.png "Create a KM Control hosted control")  
  
6.  Click **Save and Close**.  
  
<a name="Step2"></a>   
## Step 2: Configure an action call to display the knowledge base search  
 Create an action call to display the newly created hosted control in the agent desktop. You’ll use the `default` action for the newly created hosted control to display it. After creating the action, add it to the `SessionNew` event for the **Dynamics 365 Global Manager** hosted control to automatically load and display the hosted control when a new session is created on opening a case.  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_usd](../includes/proc-settings-usd.md)]  
  
2.  Click **Action Calls**.  
  
3.  Click **New**.  
  
4.  On the **New Action Call** page, specify the following values.  
  
    |Field|Value|  
    |-----------|-----------|  
    |Name|Sample: Open KB Search Control|  
    |Hosted Control|Sample KB Search|  
    |Action|default|  
  
 ![Action call to open the KB Search panel](../unified-service-desk/media/usd-openkmcontrol.png "Action call to open the KB Search panel")  
  
5.  Click **Save and close**.  
  
6.  Go to **Unified Service Desk** page, and then click **Events**.  
  
7.  Search for the `SessionNew` event, and then click it to open the event configuration page.  
  
8.  Click the **Add Action Call record** button to add the action call.  
  
 ![Add action to event](../unified-service-desk/media/usd-addactiontoevent.png "Add action to event")  
  
9. Type `Sample: Open KB Search Control` in the search box, and press ENTER or click the search button to add the action to the event. Change the order of the added action to 1, and then click the the **Save**![Auto save button](../unified-service-desk/media/crm-itpro-cust-autosaveicon.png "Auto save button") button in the lower-right corner.  
  
<a name="Step3"></a>   
## Step 3: Configure action calls to automatically display and hide the knowledge base search panel  
 Create two action calls to display and hide the panel (`RightPanel`) that will display the newly added hosted control. Next, add those to appropriate events to automatically display (expand) and hide (collapse) the panel in the agent desktop when a new session is created and the session is closed respectively.  
  
 Use the new `SetVisualProperty` action to control the visual properties of the panel layout (**Main Layout** hosted control in the “Base sample application”). `SetVisualProperty` has to be manually added to the hosted control to be used. However, if you create a new instance of a **Panel Layout** type of hosted control, `SetVisualProperty` will be available by default.  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_usd](../includes/proc-settings-usd.md)]  
  
2.  Click **Hosted Controls**.  
  
3.  Click **Main Layout** in the list of hosted controls.  
  
    > [!NOTE]

## Step 4: Configure an action call to automatically search the knowledge base using the incident (case) title  
 Create an action call to automatically populate the case title in the knowledge base search control to search based on the case title name. After creating the action, you’ll add it to the `BrowserDocumentComplete` event of the **Incident** hosted control to fire this action after the case records have loaded in the agent desktop.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The **Incident** hosted control is created when you deploy the Base sample application in your [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] instance.

    |Action|Search|  
    |Data|query=[[incident.title]+]|  
  
    > [!TIP]
    >  You can use additional data parameters in the `Search` action to specify knowledge base search parameters such as the number of search results to return, the type of knowledge base articles to be searched, and sorting options. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Search](../unified-service-desk/km-control-hosted-control.md#Search)  
  
 ![Create an action call](../unified-service-desk/media/usd-searchkbwithcasetitleaction.png "Create an action call")  
  
5.  Click **Save**.  
  
6.  On the navigation pane, click **Unified Service Desk**, and then click **Hosted Controls**.  
  
7.  Click **Incident** from the list of hosted controls.  
  
8.  Click the down arrow next to **Incident**, and then click **Events**.  
  
 ![View events for the Incident hosted control](../unified-service-desk/media/usd-addactiontoincidentevent.png "View events for the Incident hosted control")  
  
9. In the events list for the **Incident** hosted control, click `BrowserDocumentComplete`.

Also, the knowledge base search panel is configured to automatically display when a session is created, and automatically hide when you close the session. You can test this by running the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client application and connecting to the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] instance where you performed steps 1 through 4 of this walkthrough. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)]  
>   
>  Perform the rest of the steps to display a knowledge base article from the search results in a tab, and configure contextual actions for a selected knowledge base article in the search panel such as copying an article link and associating the article to the current case.  
  
<a name="Step5"></a>   
## Step 5: Configure hosted controls and action calls to display an article in a tab  
 In this step, you will:  
  
-   Configure a hosted control of type **Standard Web Application** to display the knowledge base article.  
  
-   Configure action calls to display the article in the hosted control whose title is clicked in the knowledge base search pane.  
  
-   Add the action calls to the [ResultOpen](../unified-service-desk/km-control-hosted-control.md#ResultOpen) event of the `KM Control` hosted control so that the action calls are executed when somebody clicks on the KB article title.  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_usd](../includes/proc-settings-usd.md)]  
  
2.  Click **Hosted Controls**.  
  
3.  Click **New**.
