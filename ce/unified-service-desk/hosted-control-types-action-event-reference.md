# Hosted control types, action, and event reference in Unified Service Desk

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

This section provides information about the various types of hosted controls in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)], and the predefined [!INCLUDE[pn_user_inteface_integration_uii](../includes/pn-user-interface-integration-uii.md)] actions and events available for each hosted control type. You can also view information about the predefined [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)] actions and events for hosted controls in the embedded help in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [View embedded help for actions and events](../unified-service-desk/view-embedded-help-for-actions-and-events.md)  
  
 Apart from the predefined hosted control types, this section also provides information about a custom hosted control, `Session Timer`, that becomes available when you deploy one of the sample [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] applications on your Microsoft Dataverse instance. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Session Timer (Custom Hosted Control)](../unified-service-desk/session-timer-custom-hosted-control.md)  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Most of the predefined hosted controls in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] have a predefined action called **default**, which calls an action on the hosted control that’s marked as the default. Because none of the predefined actions for any of the predefined hosted controls are marked as default, calling the **default** action on any predefined hosted control just loads the respective hosted control. However, for a custom [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] hosted control, you can define an action and set it as default so that the action is called when the **default** action is called on the custom hosted control.
