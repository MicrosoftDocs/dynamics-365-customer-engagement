# Hosted control types, action, and event reference in Unified Service Desk
This section provides information about the various types of hosted controls in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)], and the predefined [!INCLUDE[pn_user_inteface_integration_uii](../includes/pn-user-interface-integration-uii.md)] actions and events available for each hosted control type. You can also view information about the predefined [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)] actions and events for hosted controls in the embedded help in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [View embedded help for actions and events](../unified-service-desk/view-embedded-help-for-actions-and-events.md)  
  
 Apart from the predefined hosted control types, this section also provides information about a custom hosted control, `Session Timer`, that becomes available when you deploy one of the sample [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] applications on your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] instance. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Session Timer (Custom Hosted Control)](../unified-service-desk/session-timer-custom-hosted-control.md)  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Most of the predefined hosted controls in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] have a predefined action called **default**, which calls an action on the hosted control thatâ€™s marked as the default. Because none of the predefined actions for any of the predefined hosted controls are marked as default, calling the **default** action on any predefined hosted control just loads the respective hosted control. However, for a custom [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] hosted control, you can define an action and set it as default so that the action is called when the **default** action is called on the custom hosted control.
