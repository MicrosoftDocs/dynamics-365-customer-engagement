# View embedded help for actions and events in Unified Service Desk
[!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] provides an embedded help on actions and events within [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].  
  
<a name="Actions"></a>   
## Embedded help for actions  
 When you create an action call for a UII action, the help is displayed below the data field. For information about creating an action call, see [Create an action call for a UII action](../unified-service-desk/create-action-call-uii-action.md).
