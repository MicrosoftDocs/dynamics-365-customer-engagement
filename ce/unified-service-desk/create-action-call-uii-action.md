# Create an action call for a UII action in Unified Service Desk
There are two ways in which you can create an action call for a [!INCLUDE[pn_user_inteface_integration_uii](../includes/pn-user-interface-integration-uii.md)] action:  
  
-   Create an action call and then attach it to the hosted control and the respective UII action.  
  
-   Start from a hosted control that contains the UII action that you want to create the action call for.  
  
<a name="StartActionCall"></a>   
## Start from the action call  
  
1.  Sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].  
  
2. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_usd](../includes/proc-settings-usd.md)]  
  
3.  Click **Action Calls**.  
  
4.  On the action call list page, choose **Add New Action Call** on the command bar.  
  
5.  On the **New Action Call** page, specify information for various fields as per the following table.  
  
 ![New action call in Unified Service Desk](../unified-service-desk/media/usd-new-action-call.png "New action call in Unified Service Desk")  
  
    |Field|Description|  
    |-----------|-----------------|  
    |Name|A descriptive name of the action call.|  
    |Hosted Control|The hosted control having the UII action to be called.|  
    |Action|The UII action name to call on the hosted control. To call a UII action for a hosted control, the action must be added to the list of UII actions for a hosted control in Dynamics 365.|  
    |Data|This is the serialized data (string data) that is passed as the data parameter to the action. **Note:**  Some actions interpret multiline input specified here as separate parameters.|  
    |Condition|This is a [!INCLUDE[pn_JavaScript](../includes/pn-javascript.md)] expression that should result in true or false. For example, “[[account.name]]”==”My Account”<br /><br /> If the condition results in false or throws an exception, the action won’t be performed. If the action is blank or the result is true, the action will be performed. **Note:**  If the condition results in false or throws an exception, the action won’t be performed. If the action is blank or the result is true, the action will be performed.|  
    |Shortcut Key|This is a shortcut key that can be used by an agent to run this action while within the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client. Anything valid for the `KeyBinding.Gesture` string can be used here. For more information see: [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.input.keybinding.gesture.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.windows.input.keybinding.gesture.aspx).<br /><br /> Examples:<br /><br /> -   CTRL+R<br />-   CTRL+ALT+A<br />-   SHIFT+ALT+A<br />-   CTRL-F12|
