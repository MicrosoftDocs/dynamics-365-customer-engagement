# Standard Web Application (hosted control)

A Standard Web Application hosted control is a type of hosted control that can show and automate webpages from apps that aren't model-driven, such as external websites. You can use script injection to work with the features of the external webpages, such as calling JavaScript functions or changing the Document Object Model (DOM). You can also use the **RunScript** action to inject JavaScript or get values from the webpage. In this article, you'll learn how to make a Standard Web Application hosted control and what actions it can do.

> [!NOTE]
> This hosted control type doesn't support the [!INCLUDE[pn_hosted_application_toolkit_hat](../includes/pn-hosted-application-toolkit-hat.md)], which facilitates the task of automating the UI of a hosted application. HAT consists of data-driven adapters, descriptive bindings, and automation (Windows workflows) to automate the applications.

## Create a Standard Web Application hosted control

While you're creating a new hosted control, the fields on the **New Hosted Control** screen will vary based on the type of hosted control you want to create. This section provides information about the specific fields that are unique to the Standard Web Application hosted control type. More information: [Create or edit a hosted control](../unified-service-desk/create-edit-hosted-control.md)

![Standard Web Application hosted control.](../unified-service-desk/media/crm-itpro-usd-standardwebapplicationhostedcontrol.png "Standard Web Application hosted control")  

On the **New Hosted Control** screen:  

- In the **Unified Service Desk** area, select **Standard Web Application** from the **Unified Service Desk Component Type** drop-down list.  

- From the **Allow Multiple Pages** drop-down list, select **Yes** to automatically create a drop-down list when a second URL is called or a window navigation rule directs a page to the tab. This will allow the user to quickly search between the pages that are attached to this control. If you select **No**, when [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] receives a navigate action call or a page is routed to the tab, it will replace the page that is currently displayed and update the browser history.  

- The **Hosting Type** drop-down list specifies how you want this control to be hosted. You can choose **Chrome Process** (default) or **Internal WPF**. More information: [Select a hosting method for hosted controls](../unified-service-desk/select-hosting-method-controls.md)  

- In the **Common Properties** area, select the **Application is Global** check box to set the hosted control as global. Global hosted controls can be displayed outside of a customer session. Controls like the agent's dashboard, wall, or search are common uses for global hosted controls. Global hosted controls don't have a session-specific state, so when you change sessions, these same global hosted controls remain. If this check box isn't selected, the hosted control becomes session-based. Session-based controls exist in the context of the customer session. If the user changes to another session, all the pages from the previous session are hidden.  

- In the **Display Group** field, specify a panel where this hosted control will be displayed. More information: [Panels](../unified-service-desk/panels-panel-types-panel-layouts.md#Panels)

|       Frame       |                                                                                                                                                                        When frames exist on the page, this parameter specifies the name of the frame to navigate, rather than navigating the main window.                                                                                                                                                                         |
|     postdata      |                 Data that is sent to the server as part of an HTTP POST transaction. A POST transaction is typically used to send data gathered by an HTML page. In [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)], this data can be received from any event triggered by using "`<https://event/?>`". Example: `[[postdata]+]`<br /><br /> Alternatively, the data can be passed as encoded string with its header type in the intended format.                 |
|      header       | A string value that contains additional HTTP headers to send to the server. When the `postdata` parameter is used in the **Navigate** action, you should also specify an appropriate value for the `header` parameter. Example: `Content-Type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded`<br /><br /> If a [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]POST event triggers the **Navigate** action, the default value of this parameter should be `header=[[header]+]`<br /><br /> To add multiple headers, the value of this parameter should be: `header=$Multiline(<headers separated by newline>)`<br /><br /> Example:`header=$Multiline(accessToken;dummyAccessToken==`<br /><br />`refreshToken;dummyRefreshToken===)` |

### New_CRM_Page

Creates a page for creating a new record of the entity specified, and treats the page as a pop-up window from the specified hosted control. The window navigation rules are evaluated to determine the location where the page to create the entity record is displayed.  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|LogicalName|The logical name of the entity for creating a new instance.|  

> [!NOTE]
> The rest of the parameters should consist of name/value pairs. These are the additional pre-populated values in the form for creating a new record for the specified entity. More information: Step 4 in [Walkthrough 7: Configure agent scripting in your agent application](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough-configure-agent-scripting-agent-application.md)

### Open_CRM_Page

Opens an existing instance of the entity specified and identified by the ID, and treats the page as a pop-up window from the specified hosted control. The window navigation rules are evaluated to determine the location where the pop-up window should be displayed.  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|LogicalName|The logical name of the entity to open.|  
|id|The ID of the entity record to open.|  

### Popup

"Pops up" a URL from the hosted control and runs the window navigation rules against it for routing the pop-up window to the appropriate location.  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|url|Routes a pop-up window from this hosted control by using this URL as if it were a pop-up window requested from the displayed control.|  
|frame|The frame from which this pop-up window originated.|  

<a name="RealignWindow"></a>

### RealignWindow

[!INCLUDE[cc_RealignWindow_Action](../includes/cc-realignwindow-action.md)]

### RunScript

This action injects JavaScript into the main frame of the application. You should avoid using Microsoft Dataverse client SDK calls with this action; instead, use the **RunXrmCommand** action.  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
| *See description*|The data parameter is the JavaScript that will be injected into the form. **Note:**  The replacement parameters can be used in the script, and they'll be replaced before the script is executed.|  

<a name="SetSize"></a>

### SetSize

This action explicitly sets the width and height of the hosted control. This is particularly useful when using "auto" in your panel layouts.  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|width|The width of the hosted control.|  
|height|The height of the hosted control.|  

### WaitForComplete

This action can be used to block processing until the URL finishes loading.  

> [!NOTE]
> Some webpages, particularly model-driven app pages, have multiple frames. This action waits for only the main frame to finish loading.  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|Milliseconds|Optional parameter to indicate how long, in milliseconds, to wait before timing out.|  

<a name="events"></a>

## Predefined events

The following predefined events are associated with this hosted control type.  

### BrowserDocumentComplete

Occurs when the page has finished loading. On a CRM Page type of hosted control, this event occurs after the data has been saved to the replacement parameter list. This event occurs only once, even though multiple frames will have individually fired their **BrowserDocumentComplete** events.  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|url|The URL of the page that has finished loading.|  

### PopupRouted

 Occurs after a pop-up window has been routed by the system.  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|url|The URL of the pop-up window that was routed.|
