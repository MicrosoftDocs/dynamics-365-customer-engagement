# Automate hosted applications using HAT automation activities
[!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Workflow_Foundation](../includes/pn-windows-workflow-foundation.md)] (WF) allows you to implement business rules and procedures through a unique process of designing a workflow or automation model composed of multiple elements (called *activities*) that describe the business process. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Windows Workflow Foundation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd489441\(v=vs.100\).aspx)  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[pn_user_inteface_integration_uii](../includes/pn-user-interface-integration-uii.md)], you can use the WF workflows or automations to describe the business logic that drives the hosted applications. Automations in [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)] are WF assemblies or XAML that are executed by the [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)] Automation Manager. Automations drive hosted applications independent of their type.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[pn_hosted_application_toolkit_hat](../includes/pn-hosted-application-toolkit-hat.md)] Software Factory provides a set of workflow activities to drive automations that help you to automate hosted applications. The activities cover [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)] action, such as `DoAction` and `SetContext`, as well as the original WF activities to drive applications hosted via data-driven adapters (DDAs). If the automation activities provided by [!INCLUDE[pn_hat](../includes/pn-hat.md)] donâ€™t meet your development needs, you can extend them to fit your requirements.
