# Walkthrough: Create a UII Windows Forms Hosted Control in Unified Service Desk
This walkthrough demonstrates how you can build a [Windows Forms](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms229601\(v=vs.110\).aspx) [!INCLUDE[pn_user_inteface_integration_uii](../includes/pn-user-interface-integration-uii.md)] hosted control that interacts with [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] and standalone or web external applications.  
  
 In this walkthrough, you’ll:  
  
- Create a [!INCLUDE[pn_user_inteface_integration_uii](../includes/pn-user-interface-integration-uii.md)] Windows Forms hosted control, **Sample UII Windows Forms Hosted Control**, which will display first name, last name, street address, and ID of a contact when you search for contacts, and click a contact name to open it in a session in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]. These values are displayed from the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] context.  
  
- Change first name, last name, or street address values in an external application and web application hosted in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] from the [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)] Windows Forms hosted control that we create. The external and web applications were created in earlier walkthroughs: [Walkthrough: Create a UII Application Adapter](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough-create-uii-application-adapter.md) and [Walkthrough: Create a UII Web Application Adapter](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough-create-uii-web-application-adapter.md).  
  
- Notify changes to the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] context to update the values there.  
  
<a name="Prereq"></a>   
## Prerequisites  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_.Net_Framework](../includes/pn-microsoft-net-framework.md)] 4.5.2  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client application; required for testing the hosted control.  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_visual_studio_2012](../includes/pn-microsoft-visual-studio-2012.md)], [!INCLUDE[pn_visual_studio_2013](../includes/pn-visual-studio-2013.md)], or [!INCLUDE[pn_visual_studio_2015](../includes/pn-visual-studio-2015.md)]  
  
- [!INCLUDE[tn_nuget_package_manager](../includes/tn-nuget-package-manager.md)] for [Visual Studio 2012](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/27077b70-9dad-4c64-adcf-c7cf6bc9970c), [Visual Studio 2013](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/4ec1526c-4a8c-4a84-b702-b21a8f5293ca), or [Visual Studio 2015](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/5d345edc-2e2d-4a9c-b73b-d53956dc458d)  
  
- **CRM SDK Templates** for [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio_short](../includes/pn-visual-studio-short.md)] that contains the UII Windows Forms hosted control project template. [Download](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=400925) the **CRM SDK Templates** from the Visual Studio gallery, and double-click the CRMSDKTemplates.vsix file to install the template in [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio_short](../includes/pn-visual-studio-short.md)].  
  
- You should have completed [Walkthrough: Create a UII Application Adapter](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough-create-uii-application-adapter.md) and [Walkthrough: Create a UII Web Application Adapter](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough-create-uii-web-application-adapter.md) to ensure that you have the external application and web application set up with the respective adapters to facilitate interaction with those applications.  
  
<a name="step1"></a>   
## Step 1: Create a UII Windows Forms hosted control using Visual Studio  
  
<a name="Step1"></a>   
1. Start [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio_short](../includes/pn-visual-studio-short.md)], and create a new project.  
  
2. In the **New Project** dialog box:  
  
   1.  From the list of installed templates, expand **Visual C#**, and select **Dynamics 365 SDK Templates** > **Unified Service Desk** > **UII Windows Forms Hosted Control**.  
  
   2.  Specify the name and location of the project, and click **OK** to create a new project.  
  
   ![Create a UII Windows Form hosted control](../unified-service-desk/media/usd-create-uii-windows-form-hosted-control-1.png "Create a UII Windows Form hosted control")  
  
3. In **Solution Explorer** pane, right-click the **UiiWinformControl.cs** file, and select **Open** to display the Windows Forms designer.  
  
4. In the designer, add the following controls from the **Toolbox**:  
  
   |Control type|Name|Text|  
   |------------------|----------|----------|  
   |Label|lblFirstName|First Name|  
   |Label|lblLastName|Last Name|  
   |Label|lblAddress|Street Address|  
   |Label|lblID|ID|  
   |TextBox|txtFirstName||  
   |TextBox|txtLastName||  
   |TextBox|txtAddress||  
   |TextBox|txtID||  
   |Button|btnUpdate|Update values in hosted apps|  
   |Button|btnUpdateContext|Update context|  
  
    This is how the controls should be laid out in the designer.  
  
   ![Layout of the controls in your UII hosted control](../unified-service-desk/media/usd-ui-iwindows-form-hosted-control-design.png "Layout of the controls in your UII hosted control")  
  
5. Double-click the **Update values in hosted apps** button (`btnUpdate`) to add the code for the `click` event for this button, and add the following code.  
  
   ```csharp  
   private void btnUpdate_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)  
   {  
      // This is how you fire an action to other hosted applications.   
      // The DoAction() code in the other application or application adapter   
      // will be called.  
      FireRequestAction(new RequestActionEventArgs("QsExternalApp", "UpdateFirstName", txtFirstName.Text)); // For the external application  
      FireRequestAction(new RequestActionEventArgs("QsExternalApp", "UpdateLastName", txtLastName.Text)); // For the external application  
      FireRequestAction(new RequestActionEventArgs("QsExternalApp", "UpdateAddress", txtAddress.Text)); // For the external application  
  
      FireRequestAction(new RequestActionEventArgs("QsWebApplication", "UpdateFirstName", txtFirstName.Text)); // For the external web application  
      FireRequestAction(new RequestActionEventArgs("QsWebApplication", "UpdateLastName", txtLastName.Text)); // For the external web application  
      FireRequestAction(new RequestActionEventArgs("QsWebApplication", "UpdateAddress", txtAddress.Text)); // For the external web application  
   }  
   ```  
  
6. Go to the design view, double-click the **Update context** button (`btnUpdateContext`) to add the code for the click event for this button. Add the following code.  
  
   ```csharp  
   private void btnUpdateContext_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)  
   {  
      // Get the current context and create a new context object from it.  
      string temp = Context.GetContext();  
      Context updatedContext = new Context(temp);  
  
      // Update the new context with the changed information.  
      updatedContext["firstname"] = txtFirstName.Text;  
      updatedContext["lastname"] = txtLastName.Text;  
      updatedContext["address1_line1"] = txtAddress.Text;  
  
      // Notify Unified Service Desk of this new context information  
      FireChangeContext(new ContextEventArgs(updatedContext));  
  
      // Notify this UII hosted control about the change  
      NotifyContextChange(updatedContext);  
   }  
   ```  
  
7. In the same file (UiiWinformControl.cs), update the override definition of the `NotifyContextChange` method to the following:  
  
   ```csharp  
   public override void NotifyContextChange(Context context)  
   {  
      // Populating text fields from context information.  
      txtFirstName.Text = context["firstname"];  
      txtLastName.Text = context["lastname"];  
      txtAddress.Text = context["address1_line1"];  
      txtID.Text = context["CustomerID"];  
  
      base.NotifyContextChange(context);  
   }  
   ```  
  
8. Save your project, and build it (**Build** > **Build Solution**). After the project builds successfully, an assembly (.dll file) is generated with the same name as your project name (in this case, UIIWindowsFormHostedConrol1.dll) in the /bin/debug folder of your project.  
  
9. Copy this file to your [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client application installation directory (typically C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics CRM USD\USD). This file is required for testing, and eventually using this control from your client application.  
  
   > [!TIP]
   >  Note the name of the class that is used to build your [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)] hosted control in the UiiWinformControl.cs file. In this case, it’s UiiWinformControl. You’ll need this information in the next step.  
  
<a name="step2"></a>   
## Step 2: Define the hosted control in Unified Service Desk  
 To host the [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)] Windows Forms hosted control in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)], you’ll have to define and configure it.  
  
1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].  
  
2. On the nav bar, choose **Microsoft Dynamics 365** > **Settings** > **Unified Service Desk**.  
  
3. On the **Unified Service Desk** page, click **Hosted Controls**.  
  
4. On the **Hosted Controls** page, click **New**.  
  
5. On the **New Hosted Control** page, specify the following values:  
  
   |Field|Value|  
   |-----------|-----------|  
   |Name|UIIWindowsFormHostedControl|  
   |Display Name|Sample UII Windows Forms Hosted Control|  
   |USD Component Type|CCA Hosted Application|  
   |Hosted Application|Hosted Control|  
   |Application is Global|Selected|  
   |Display Group|MainPanel|  
   |Adapter|Use No Adapter|  
   |Assembly URI|UIIWindowsFormHostedControl1|  
   |Assembly Type|UIIWindowsFormHostedControl1.UiiWinformControl|  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   > **Assembly URI** is the name of your assembly and the **Assembly Type** is the name of your assembly followed by a dot (.) and then the class name in your [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio_short](../includes/pn-visual-studio-short.md)] project. In this example, the name of the assembly is `UIIWindowsFormHostedControl1` and name of the class is `UiiWinformControl`, which is the default class name when you create a [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)] Windows Forms hosted control.  
  
   ![New hosted control in Unified Service Desk](../unified-service-desk/media/usd-new-hosted-control-uii-windows-form.png "New hosted control in Unified Service Desk")  
  
6. Click **Save** to create the hosted control.  
  
<a name="step3"></a>   
## Step 3: Define UII actions for the external application and web application hosted controls in Unified Service Desk  
 The adapters for the external standalone and web applications expose the following three actions: `UpdateFirstName`, `UpdateLastName`, and `UpdateAddress`. These adapters and the hosted controls for the external standalone and web applications were created in the earlier adapter walkthroughs ([Walkthrough: Create a UII Application Adapter](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough-create-uii-application-adapter.md) and [Walkthrough: Create a UII Web Application Adapter](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough-create-uii-web-application-adapter.md)).  
  
 To update information in the external applications from within the [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)] Windows Forms hosted control, you’ll have to define three [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)] actions with the same name as defined earlier in the adapters for each of the external applications. In the earlier adapter walkthroughs ([Walkthrough: Create a UII Application Adapter](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough-create-uii-application-adapter.md) and [Walkthrough: Create a UII Web Application Adapter](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough-create-uii-web-application-adapter.md)), you defined the following two hosted controls in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] to display the external applications within [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]: `QsExternalApp` and `QsExternalWebApplication`. In this step, you’ll add three [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)] actions for each hosted control.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  If you have already added the [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)] actions as part of step 3 in [Walkthrough: Create a UII WPF Hosted Control](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough-create-uii-wpf-hosted-control.md), you don’t have to perform this step again. You can proceed to the next section for testing your hosted control.  
  
1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].  
  
2. On the nav bar, choose **Microsoft Dynamics 365** > **Settings** > **Unified Service Desk**.  
  
3. On the **Unified Service Desk** page, choose **Hosted Controls**.  
  
4. On the **Hosted Controls** page, search for the `QsExternalApp`, and open it for editing.  
  
5. On the **QsExternalApp** page, click the down arrow next to the hosted control name, and then click **UII Actions**.  
  
6. On the next page, click **Add New UII Action**.  
  
7. Type the name as **UpdateFirstName**, and click **Save & Close**. This will add the action in the previous page.  
  
8. Similarly, add the following two actions: **UpdateLastName** and **UpdateAddress**. All the three actions become available for the `QsExternalApp` hosted control.  
  
   ![Available UII actions for a hosted control](../unified-service-desk/media/usd-available-uii-actions-hosted-control.png "Available UII actions for a hosted control")  
  
9. Follow steps 4 through 8 to create three [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)] actions with the same names for the `QsExternalWebApp` hosted control.  
  
<a name="test"></a>   
## Test the hosted control  
 Before you test the [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)] Windows Forms hosted control, ensure that your sample web application is running so that it renders within [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)].  
  
1. Run the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client to connect to your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] server.  
  
2. On successful sign in, you’ll see three hosted controls: **Sample UII Windows Forms Hosted Control**, **Sample External Web Application**, and **Sample External Application**.  
  
   ![Sample hosted controls available](../unified-service-desk/media/usd-sample-hosted-controls-available.png "Sample hosted controls available")  
  
3. Choose **Search**, and then choose **Contacts**. Choose any of the contacts to display the contact details in a session. This also displays the first name, last name, street address, and ID of the currently displayed contact record in all the three sample controls as shown in the following illustration.  
  
   ![Sample controls in USD with contact information](../unified-service-desk/media/usd-3-samplecontrols-1.png "Sample controls in USD with contact information")  
  
4. Change the values in **Sample UII Windows Forms Hosted Control**, and click **Update values in hosted apps** to update the values in the other two external applications.  
  
   ![Sample controls with updated values](../unified-service-desk/media/usd-3-sample-controls-updated-values.png "Sample controls with updated values")  
  
5. In **Sample UII Windows Forms Hosted Control**, click **Update context** to update the context information in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)].  
  
   ![Values updated in the USD context](../unified-service-desk/media/usd-values-updated-context.png "Values updated in the USD context")
