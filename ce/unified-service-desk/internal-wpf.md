# Use Internal WPF to host web applications 

> [!Note]
>
> Because support for Internet Explorer 11 is deprecated, support for IE Process has also been deprecated in Unified Service Desk. For information: [Deprecation announcement](../customer-service/implement/deprecations-customer-service.md#internet-explorer-11-support-for-dynamics-365-and-microsoft-power-platform-is-deprecated).

 The `Internal WPF` browser control uses the [WpfBrowser](/dotnet/api/microsoft.crm.unifiedservicedesk.dynamics.controls.wpfbrowser) component, which is based on the [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Windows_Presentation_Foundation](../includes/pn-ms-windows-presentation-foundation.md)][WebBrowser](/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.webbrowser) control, to host the webpages in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]. This browser control is the traditional method of hosting controls in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]. It uses the security subsystem in [!INCLUDE[pn_Internet_Explorer](../includes/pn-internet-explorer.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Windows_short](../includes/pn-ms-windows-short.md)] to allow the hosted application to operate the browser functionality in the same mode as the application without changing the [!INCLUDE[pn_Internet_Explorer](../includes/pn-internet-explorer.md)] settings, and therefore reduces the security of Internet Explorer for applications outside of Unified Service Desk. While there are advantages, occasionally you may find that you need the features of an [!INCLUDE[pn_Internet_Explorer](../includes/pn-internet-explorer.md)] add-in or a feature in the native browser that may not be supported in this browser control, and you should use the **IE Process** browser control instead.
