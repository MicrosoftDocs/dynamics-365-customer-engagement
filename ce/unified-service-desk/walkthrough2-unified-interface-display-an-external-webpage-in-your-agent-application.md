# Walkthrough 2: Display an external webpage in your agent application
This walkthrough demonstrates how to display a webpage or external URL in your agent application. In this walkthrough, you’ll learn how to display the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] Guide, which is available online at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=856273, in the client application.

## Prerequisites  

- You must have completed [Walkthrough 1: Build a simple agent application for Unified Interface Apps](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough1-unified-interface-build-a-simple-agent-application.md). The configurations that you completed in the first walkthrough are required in this walkthrough.  

- This walkthrough assumes that you will be using the same user credential that you used at the end of Walkthrough 1 to sign in to the agent application. If a different user will be testing the application, you must assign the user to **Contoso Configuration**. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Walkthrough 1: Build a simple agent application for Unified Interface Apps](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough1-unified-interface-build-a-simple-agent-application.md)  

- You must be familiar with the following concepts in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]:  

  - These two types of hosted controls: Standard Web Application and Toolbar Container. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Hosted control types and action/event reference](../unified-service-desk/hosted-control-types-action-event-reference.md)  

  - How to configure [Action calls](../unified-service-desk/action-calls.md)

<a name="Step5"></a>   
## Step 5: Add the controls to the configuration  
 In this step, add the action calls, hosted controls, and toolbar that you created in this walkthrough to **Contoso Configuration** to display these controls to the user who is assigned to the configuration. **Contoso Configuration** was created in [Walkthrough 1: Build a simple agent application for Unified Interface Apps](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough1-unified-interface-build-a-simple-agent-application.md).  

 Add the following to **Contoso Configuration**.  

|Control name|Control type|  
|------------------|------------------|  
|Contoso Action Call: Display Help|Action Call|  
|Contoso Action Call: Display Help Hosted Control|Action Call|  
|Contoso Help|Hosted Control|  
|Contoso About Toolbar Container|Hosted Control|  
|Contoso About Toolbar|Toolbar|  

 To add a control to the configuration:  

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].  

2. On the nav bar, click **Microsoft Dynamics 365**, and then select **Settings**.  

3. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_usd](../includes/proc-settings-usd.md)]  

4. Click **Configuration**.  

5. Click **Contoso Configuration** to open the definition.  

6. On the nav bar, click the down arrow next to **Contoso Configuration**, and select **Action Calls**.  

7. On the next page, click **Add Existing Action Call**, type “`Contoso Action Call`” in the search bar, and then press ENTER or click the search icon.  

8. Both action calls are displayed in the search results. Add both of them.  

9. Similarly, add both of the hosted controls and the toolbar by clicking the down arrow next to **Contoso Configuration**, and clicking **Hosted Controls** and **Toolbars** respectively.  

10. Click **Save**.

## Step 6: Test the application  
 Start the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client application, and sign in to the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] instance where you configured [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] using the same user credentials that you assigned to the **Contoso Configuration** in [Walkthrough 1: Build a simple agent application for Unified Interface Apps](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough1-unified-interface-build-a-simple-agent-application.md). For information about connecting to a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] instance using the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client application, see [Connect to a Dynamics 365 instance using the Unified Service Desk client](../unified-service-desk/admin/connect-dynamics-365-instance-using-unified-service-desk-client.md) 

 Your agent application will now have a **Show Help** button at the top-right corner:  

 ![Show Help button in Unified Service Desk](../unified-service-desk/media/crm-itpro-usd-wt02-08.png "Show Help button in Unified Service Desk")  

 Clicking **Show Help** displays the specified web URL within the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] application.
