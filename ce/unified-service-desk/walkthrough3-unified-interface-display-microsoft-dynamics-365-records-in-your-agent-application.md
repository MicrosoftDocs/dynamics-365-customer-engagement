|Contoso Action Call: Display Account Search|Action Call|  
|Contoso Action Call: Search Contact|Action Call|  
|Contoso Action Call: Display Contact Search|Action Call|  
|Contoso Accounts Search|Hosted Control|  
|Contoso Contacts Search|Hosted Control|  
|Contoso Main Toolbar Container|Hosted Control|  
|Contoso Main Toolbar|Toolbar|  

 To add a control to the configuration:  

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].  

2. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_usd](../includes/proc-settings-usd.md)]  

3. Click **Configuration**.  

4. Click **Contoso Configuration** to open the definition.
