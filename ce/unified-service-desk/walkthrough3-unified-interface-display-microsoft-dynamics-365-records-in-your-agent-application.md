# Walkthrough 3: Display model-driven apps (Unified Interface apps) records in your agent application



This walkthrough demonstrates how to display model-driven app records in your agent application. In this walkthrough, you’ll display all the account and contact records in the model-driven apps. You’ll also create a search button with drop-down menu items for displaying accounts and contacts in the agent application.  

## Prerequisites  

- You must have completed [Walkthrough 1: Build a simple agent application for Unified Interface Apps](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough1-unified-interface-build-a-simple-agent-application.md). The configurations that you completed in walkthrough 1 are required in this walkthrough.  

- This walkthrough assumes that you will be using the same user credential that you used in walkthrough 1 to sign in to the agent application at the end of the walkthrough to test the application. If a different user will be testing the application, you must assign the user to **Contoso Configuration**. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Walkthrough 1: Build a simple agent application for Unified Interface Apps](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough1-unified-interface-build-a-simple-agent-application.md)  

- You must know about the following in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]:  

  - The following two types of hosted controls: Unified Interface Page and Toolbar Container. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Hosted control types and action/event reference](../unified-service-desk/hosted-control-types-action-event-reference.md)  

  - Action call and how to configure it. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Action calls](../unified-service-desk/action-calls.md)  

  - Filter access using [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] configuration. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Manage access using Unified Service Desk configuration](../unified-service-desk/admin/manage-access-using-unified-service-desk-configuration.md)

## Step 1: Create Unified Interface Page type of hosted controls to display account and contact records  
 In this step, you’ll create two hosted controls of **Unified Interface Page** type to display the account and contact records respectively.  

1. Sign in to Unified Service Desk Administrator.

8. Select **Save**.  

<a name="Step2"></a>   
## Step 2: Create a toolbar container type of hosted control  
 Toolbar Container type of hosted controls are used to hold and display the toolbars in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]. In this section, you’ll create a **Toolbar Container** hosted control that will appear at the top of the client application.  

1. Sign in to Unified Service Desk Administrator.

   |Name|Contoso Main Toolbar Container|  
   |Unified Service Desk Component Type|Toolbar Container|  
   |Display Group|ToolbarPanel|  

5. Select **Save**.  

<a name="Step3"></a>   
## Step 3: Add a toolbar and attach it to the toolbar container  
 In this step, you’ll create a toolbar, and attach the toolbar to the toolbar container hosted control created in step 2. This is done to display the toolbar in your agent application.  

1. Sign in to Unified Service Desk Administrator.  

2. Select **Toolbars** under **Basic Settings**.  

3. Select **+ New**.  

4. On the **New Toolbar** page, type **Contoso Main Toolbar** in the **Name** box, and then select **Save**.

<a name="Step4"></a>   
## Step 4: Add toolbar buttons and action calls to display records from Unified Interface Apps

 In this step, you’ll add buttons on the toolbar and attach action calls to the buttons so that when the button is selected, appropriate records are displayed in the hosted controls that were created in step 1. You’ll configure the search button so that selecting the button displays the account and contact submenu items, and selecting a button displays the respective records.  

1. After you save the toolbar in step 3, Select the **General** tab.

2. In the **Buttons** area, select **+ New Toolbar Button**.  

3. On the **New Toolbar Button** page, specify the following values:  


   |    Field    |                                          Value                                           |
   |-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   |    Name     |                                  Contoso Search Button                                   |

<a name="Step5"></a>   
## Step 5: Add the controls to the configuration  
 In this step, you’ll add the action calls, hosted controls, and toolbar that were created in this walkthrough to **Contoso Configuration** to display these controls to the user who is assigned to the configuration. **Contoso Configuration** was created in [Walkthrough 1: Build a simple agent application for Unified Interface Apps](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough1-unified-interface-build-a-simple-agent-application.md).  

 Add the following to **Contoso Configuration**.  

|Control name|Control type|

|Contoso Action Call: Search Account|Action Call|  
|Contoso Action Call: Display Account Search|Action Call|  
|Contoso Action Call: Search Contact|Action Call|  
|Contoso Action Call: Display Contact Search|Action Call|  
|Contoso Accounts Search|Hosted Control|  
|Contoso Contacts Search|Hosted Control|  
|Contoso Main Toolbar Container|Hosted Control|

## Step 6: Test the application  
 Start the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client application, and sign in to the Dynamics 365 instance where you configured [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] using the same user credentials that you assigned to the **Contoso Configuration** in [Walkthrough 1: Build a simple agent application for Unified Interface Apps](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough1-unified-interface-build-a-simple-agent-application.md). For information about connecting to Dataverse instance using the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client application, see [Connect to a model-driven instance using the Unified Service Desk client](../unified-service-desk/admin/connect-dynamics-365-instance-using-unified-service-desk-client.md).  

 Your agent application will now have a **SEARCH** button in the toolbar area with two child buttons (**Account** and **Contact**) that are displayed on selecting the down arrow.  

 ![Display account and contact records.](../unified-service-desk/media/crm-itpro-usd-wt03-12.png "Display account and contact records")  

 Select **Account** or **Contact** under the **SEARCH** button to display the respective records from your instance in separate tabs in the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client application.  

 ![Contact records displayed.](../unified-service-desk/media/crm-itpro-usd-wt03-13-unified-interface.png "Contact records displayed")  

<a name="Conclusion"></a>   
## Conclusion  
 In this walkthrough, you learned how to display model-driven app records in the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client application. You also learned how to filter access to [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] controls using configuration.
