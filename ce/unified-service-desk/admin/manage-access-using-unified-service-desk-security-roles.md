# Use security roles to manage access 
You must assign the two [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] security roles to appropriate users or teams. The **USD Administrator** role must be assigned to the users who will be configuring the application using [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] to define an agent application. The **USD Agent** role must be assigned to the end users (agents) who will be using the client application to connect to the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] instance with the configured [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] entities.  
  
 You must also assign the appropriate [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] security role to the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] administrators and agents along with the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] security role to facilitate appropriate access on the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] entities along with the custom [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] and UII entities. For example, you should assign the **Customer Service Representative** role along with the **USD Agent** role to the agents.  
  
 For information about assigning a security role to a user or team in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], see [Security roles and privileges](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/security-roles-privileges) or [Manage teams](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/manage-teams).
