## Check your Unified Service Desk solution version number

To determine whether you need to update your [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] installation, you must check your solution version number to see if it's the latest.
  
In your Dataverse instance, navigate to Dataverse, then select **Settings** > **Solutions**. If the version numbers of the **UiiForMicrosoftDynamicsCRM2011** and **DynamicsUnifiedServiceDesk** solutions match those that are mentioned in the following table, then you have the latest version of [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)].

|Unified Service Desk 4.2    |  4.2.0.51    |  
|Unified Service Desk 4.1    |  4.1.1.1433    |
