# Updating the solution
Read this topic only if you have an existing installation of [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] from the previous release of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)], and want to update to the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_2016](../../includes/pn-crm-2016.md)] release.  
  
 If you’re installing [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] for the first time, you can skip this topic.

## Check if you need to update the Unified Service Desk solution  
 If you’re unsure whether you need to update your [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] installation, check the following versions to be sure.  
  
### Check the Unified Service Desk solution version  
 In your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] instance, navigate to **[!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]** > **Settings** > **Solutions**. If the version numbers of the solutions match those in the table, you have the latest version of [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)], and don’t need to update.  
  
|Solution name|Version|  
|-------------------|-------------|  
|UiiForMicrosoftDynamicsCRM2011|3.3.0.xxx|  
|DynamicsUnifiedServiceDesk|2.0.0.xxx|  
  
<a name="UpdateSolutions"></a>   
## Update Unified Service Desk solutions  
 Before you update your [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] solutions, ensure that the version of your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] on-premises organization is [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_2016](../../includes/pn-crm-2016.md)], [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_2015_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-2015-shortest.md)], or [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_2013_sp_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-2013-sp-shortest.md)].  
  
1.  [Download the Unified Service Desk package file](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=854761) (CRM2016-8.x.x-USD-PackageDeployer.exe), and save it on your computer.  
  
2.  Run the downloaded file to extract the contents into a folder.  
  
3.  After the files are extracted, if the [!INCLUDE[pn_package_deployer_tool](../../includes/pn-package-deployer-tool.md)] starts automatically, close it.  
  
4.  In the extracted folder, locate the following two solution files in the USDPackageDeployer\\*\<PackageName>* folder, where *\<PackageName>* is the name of the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] package you currently have installed in your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] instance:  
  
    -   UiiForMicrosoftDynamicsCRM_3_0_managed.zip  
  
    -   DynamicsUnifiedServiceDesk_1_0_managed.zip  
  
     For example, if you currently have Base package installed, you must navigate to the USDPackageDeployer\BasePackage folder to find the solution files for updating. Similarly, navigate to the USDPackageDeployer\CRM2013SP1Package folder if you have the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_2013_sp_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-2013-sp-shortest.md)] package, to the USDPackageDeployer\CRM2013SP1withProductUpdatesPackage folder if you have the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_2013_sp_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-2013-sp-shortest.md)] with Product Updates package, and USDPackageDeployer\ParatureKnowledgeManagementPackage folder if you have the Knowledge Management package.  
  
5.  Sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].  
  
6.  Go to **Settings** > **Solutions**.   
  
7.  On the **Actions** toolbar, click **Import**.  
  
8.  Browse to the UiiForMicrosoftDynamicsCRM_3_0_managed.zip file in the appropriate folder as explained in step 4, and select to import it to update the existing solution in your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] instance.  
  
9. The next page will display a yellow bar saying **This solution package contains an update for a solution that is already installed**. Review the information about the solution, and click **Next**.  
  
10. On the next page, select the **Maintain customizations (recommended)** option and ensure that the **Enable any SDK message processing steps included in the solution** check box is selected. Click **Next**.  
  
     After the solution import completes successfully, the **UiiForMicrosoftDynamicsCRM** solution is updated.  
  
11. Repeat steps 7-10 for the DynamicsUnifiedServiceDesk_1_0_managed.zip file to update the **DynamicsUnifiedServiceDesk** solution in your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] instance.  
  
     For detailed information about updating solutions in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], see [Import, update, and export solutions](../../customize/import-update-export-solutions.md).  
  
12. In [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], verify the version numbers of the updated solutions with those listed in the table shown earlier to ensure they’re the latest versions.  
  
13. Close the browser instance, and sign in again to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] to see the new features in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [What's new in Unified Service Desk for administrators](../../unified-service-desk/admin/whats-new-unified-service-desk-administrators.md).
