# Access management in Unified Service Desk



## Overview of access control

[!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] configuration entities and the underlying [!INCLUDE[pn_user_inteface_integration_uii](../../includes/pn-user-interface-integration-uii.md)] entities are stored in Microsoft Dataverse, and you can use the Dataverse security model to govern access to both of these entities. Dataverse has a robust security model that combines role-based, record-level, and field-level security to define the overall security rights that users have. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Security concepts for Microsoft Dynamics CRM](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/security-concepts)  
  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] users can be broadly classified into two categories:  
  
- **Administrators**: People who configure the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] and UII entities to define an agent application.  
  
- **Agents**: People who use the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client application to read the configuration in the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] and UII entities to perform their day-to-day work in a call center.  
  
## Using Unified Service Desk security roles  
 When you deploy [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] to the Dataverse instance, four security roles are created:  
  
- **UIIAdministrator** and **UIIAgent** roles define access to the UII and required the Dataverse entities.  
  
- **USD Administrator** and **USD Agent** roles define access to the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] entities, the underlying UII entities, and required the Dataverse entities. You must assign one of these two roles to users in your organization depending on their job role (administrator or agent).

## Using Unified Service Desk configuration  
 Another approach to filtering access to [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] data is through the use of configurations. A configuration is the logical grouping of various components in the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] agent application such as action calls, agent scripts, entity searches, events, and hosted controls. The configuration can be assigned to a user so that when the user starts the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] agent application, only the components included in the configuration are displayed. This is a great way to filter things that you want to be displayed to your agents without having to manage their security roles. However, please keep the following things in mind:  
  
- A configuration can only be assigned to a user, and not to a team in Dataverse.  
  
- A configuration only filters the components when you access [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] information through the client application. If you access Dataverse or [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_dynamics_crm_for_outlook](../../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-for-outlook.md)] directly, you can access data as per your Dataverse security role.
