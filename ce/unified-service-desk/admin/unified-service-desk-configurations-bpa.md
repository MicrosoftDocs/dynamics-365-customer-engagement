# [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] Configurations

[!INCLUDE[pn-best-practices-analyzer](../../includes/pn-best-practices-analyzer.md)] analyzes the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] configurations that you make in Dynamics 365.

## Internal WPF Hosting Type
 
[!INCLUDE[pn-best-practices-analyzer](../../includes/pn-best-practices-analyzer.md)] checks for **Internal WPF** hosting type hosted controls that you configure in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] and displays a warning when one or more Internal WPF hosting type hosted controls are configured.

We recommend that you move the **Hosting Type** of all the hosted controls of component type **CRM Page** or **Standard Web Application** from **Internal WPF** to **IE Process**.

### Mitigation

For all the hosted controls of component type **CRM Page** or **Standard Web Application**, we recommend that you move the hosting type from **Internal WPF** to **IE Process**.

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].
2. Go to **Settings** > **[!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]** > **Hosted Controls**.
3. Select the applicable hosted controls from the list. </br>You can change the hosting type for only CRM Page and Standard Web Application hosted controls.
4. In the **Hosting Type** list, select **IE Process**.
5. Select **Save**.

## Actions Calls in PageLoadComplete Event

[!INCLUDE[pn-best-practices-analyzer](../../includes/pn-best-practices-analyzer.md)] checks and displays a warning message when you associate any action calls with the **PageLoadComplete** event.
<!--Editing: Above, I changed "PageLoadDocument" to "PageLoadComplete"; please correct if this is wrong. -->

Action calls that are associated with the **PageLoadComplete** event occur several times per page load when an iFrame or frame is used on the CRM entity forms.

[!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] works best when **PageLoadComplete** is replaced with a **BrowserDocumentComplete** or **DataReady** event if you're using this event for CRM entity forms.

### Mitigation

Replace the **PageLoadComplete** event with a **BrowserDocumentComplete** event or **DataReady** event if you're using it for CRM entity forms.

> [!Note]
> The **DataReady** event is available for use in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]
> 3.0 or later.

## Actions Calls with Events

[!INCLUDE[pn-best-practices-analyzer](../../includes/pn-best-practices-analyzer.md)] checks and displays a warning when you associate 10 or more action calls with the events listed in the following table.

|Event|Description|
|-----------|------------|
|**DesktopReady**|A **DesktopReady** event occurs on startup after all the desktop initialization are complete and the connections to Dynamics 365 are established.
|**SessionNew**|A **SessionNew** event occurs when a new session is created.|
|**SessionActivated**|A **SessionActivated** event occurs when a new session is activated.|
|**SessionDeactivated**|A **SessionDeactivated** event occurs when a new session is deactivated.|
|**SessionClosed**|A **SessionClosed** event occurs when a session is closed.|

[!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] works best when you associate 10 or fewer actions with any event.

### Mitigation

[!INCLUDE[pn-best-practices-analyzer](../../includes/pn-best-practices-analyzer.md)] recommends optimizing to associate 10 or fewers action calls with **DesktopReady**, **SessionNew** **SessionActivated**, **SessionDeactivated**, and **SessionClosed** events.

## Number of Navigation Rules

[!INCLUDE[pn-best-practices-analyzer](../../includes/pn-best-practices-analyzer.md)] checks for the number of navigation rules that you configure in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] and displays a warning message when the value is more than **50**.

[!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] works best when 50 or fewer navigation rules are configured.

### Mitigation

[!INCLUDE[pn-best-practices-analyzer](../../includes/pn-best-practices-analyzer.md)] recommends optimizing the number of navigation rules in the range between 0 and 50.

## Show Script Errors (ShowScriptErrors)

[!INCLUDE[pn-best-practices-analyzer](../../includes/pn-best-practices-analyzer.md)] checks for the **ShowScriptErrors** value and displays a warning message when the value is set to **true**.

When you enable Show Script Errors, you often see pop-up error messages.

To work without interruption, you can set the **ShowScriptErrors** value to **false**.

### Mitigation

Set **ShowScriptErrors** to **false**:

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].
2. Go to **Settings** > **[!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]** > **Options**
3. In the list of options, select **ShowScriptErrors**.
4. In the **Value** field, select **false**.
5. Select **Save**.

## Client Caching

[!INCLUDE[pn-best-practices-analyzer](../../includes/pn-best-practices-analyzer.md)] checks for the client caching option and displays a warning message when the field is blank.

You can use client caching to reduce the amount of bandwidth required during [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] startup.

### Mitigation

Enable client caching:

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].
2. Go to **Settings** > **[!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]** > **Options**
3. To create a new option, select **New** on the command bar.
4. For the new option, select **ClientCacheVersionNumber** in the **Name** box, and then type an alphanumeric number in the **Value** box. <br/>The alphanumeric value is used as the cache key for [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]. The alphanumeric value can be of any value but unique for each time you change.
5. Select **Save**.

> [!Note]
> When an agent launches the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client again, client caching isn't used. However, it doesn't delete or refresh the client cache store for the agent. When you remove the **DisableCaching** key for the agent, the agent returns to using the previously stored client cache store.

[!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Enable client caching](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/unified-service-desk/admin/configure-client-caching-unified-service-desk)

## Maximum Number of Sessions (maxNumberOfSessions)

[!INCLUDE[pn-best-practices-analyzer](../../includes/pn-best-practices-analyzer.md)] checks for the **maxNumberOfSessions** option and displays a warning message or an error message in accordance with the following table.

| Error   | 0                   |
| Error   | More than 5         |
| Warning | 4 or 5              |

**maxNumberOfSesions** indicates the maximum number of simultaneous sessions that each user can open using [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)].

[!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] works best when the **maxNumberOfSesions** value is more than **0** and less than or equal to **3**.

### Mitigation
