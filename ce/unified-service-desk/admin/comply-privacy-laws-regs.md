# Comply with privacy laws and regulations

## Introduction

[!INCLUDE [gdpr-intro](~/../shared-content/shared/privacy-includes/gdpr-intro.md)]

## Shared responsibility model
Your compliance with the privacy laws and regulations is an ongoing process and involves your role as a **controller** and, in some cases, Microsoft as a **processor**. 
Depending on which model-driven app your organization uses, you may find that you are both controller and processor or that you have a shared responsibility with Microsoft.

[!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client application runs on-premises, so you hold both the controller and processor roles:

- **Controller.** The natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. A controller doesn't have to be located within the EU for the privacy laws and regulations to apply.

- **Processor.** The natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.

## Data definitions

 Any information related to an identified or identifiable natural person is considered as personal data. This includes both direct identification (such as your legal name) and indirect identification (such as specific information that makes it clear that it's you the data references).
Personal data also includes online identifiers (such as IP addresses and mobile device IDs) and location data.
