# Export Unified Service Desk configuration data



You can export your [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] configuration data from your source system by using the default [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] configuration data schema file.  
  
1. Download the [!INCLUDE[pn_configuration_migration_tool](../../includes/pn-configuration-migration-tool.md)] and the default [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] configuration data schema file (USDDefaultSchema.xml). The tool and the configuration data schema file are available in the [Microsoft Dataverse SDK download package](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=627298).  
  
   1. Download the package (.exe), and extract it to find the tool in the SDK\Tools\ConfigurationMigration folder.  
  
   2. Download the UII SDK package (.exe), and extract it to find the USDDefaultSchema.xml file in the UII\USD Developer Assets\USD Configuration Tool Schema folder.  
  
2. Double-click the DataMigrationUtility.exe file in the SDK\Tools\ConfigurationMigration folder to run the [!INCLUDE[pn_configuration_migration_tool](../../includes/pn-configuration-migration-tool.md)], and choose **Export data** in the main screen.  
  
3. On the **Login** screen, provide authentication details to connect to your [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)] from where you want to export data. If you have multiple organizations on Dataverse server, and want to select the organization from where to export the data, select the **Always display list of available orgs** check box. Select **Login**.  
  
4. If you have multiple organizations, and you selected the **Always display list of available orgs** check box, the next screen lets you choose the organization that you want to connect to. Select the organization to connect to.  
  
5. On the next screen, select the default [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] configuration data schema file (USDDefaultSchema.xml) to be used for the data export.  
  
6. Specify the name and location of the data file to be exported.  
  
7. Choose **Export Data**. The screen displays the export progress status and the location of the exported file at the bottom of the screen once the export is complete.  
  
8. Choose **Exit** to close the tool.
