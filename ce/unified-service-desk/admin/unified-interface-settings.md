# Preview feature - Set default Unified Interface App using Unified Interface Settings

Unified Interface Settings is a new configuration element introduced under **Advanced Settings** in the Unified Service Desk Administrator app. Unified Interface Settings enables you as an administrator to configure the default Unified Interface App for your agents and transform the Unified Service Desk sign-in experience.  

![Unified Interface Settings](../media/usd-crm-unified-interface-settings.PNG "Unified Interface Settings")

In addition, you can now configure the settings like a theme, Unified Interface App, and assign users (agents) to the Unified Interface Settings record. After creating a Unified Interface Settings record, you can assign this record to a configuration, so that when the users (agents) sign in to Unified Service Desk client, the system authenticates the users (agents) straight away without showing the application selection window.

> [!NOTE]
> The Unified Interface Settings configuration option is supported only on Dynamics 365 Unified Interface app and not supported on Dynamics 365 Web Client.

    >[!Note]
    > In the above step, we added an existing Unified Interface Settings record to the configuration. To create a new Unified Interface Settings record, see [How to create Unified Interface Setting record](#how-to-create-unified-interface-setting-record).

5. Select **Save & Close**.

## Login experience to Unified Service Desk 

Here are the scenarios you need to consider for signing in to Unified Service Desk.

### Scenario 1: Users (agents) assigned to Configuration with a Unified Interface Settings record

Add users (agents) to a **Configuration** and add a record to the **Unified Interface Settings** field in the **Configuration**. When the user (agent) added to the configuration signs in to Unified Service Desk, the system authenticates the user (agent) and displays the landing page of the Unified Interface App. 

### Scenario 2: Users (agents) assigned to Configuration without a Unified Interface Settings record

Add users (agents) to a **Configuration**, and the **Unified Interface Settings** field is empty in the **Configuration**. In this scenario consider three cases:

 - If there is a default **Configuration** with a **Unified Interface Settings** record assigned, then the system authenticates the user (agent) and displays the landing page of Unified Interface App.

 - If there is a default **Configuration** with no **Unified Interface Settings** record, then during login, the system displays the application selection window for the user (agent) to select Unified Interface App.

 - If there is no default **Configuration**, then during login, the system displays the application selection window for the user (agent) to select Unified Interface App.

### Scenario 3: Users (agents) assigned to Configuration, and Unified Interface Settings record is not created

Add users (agents) to a **Configuration**, and no Unified Interface Settings records are created. As a result, there are no records to select for the **Unified Interface Settings** field in the **Configuration**. In this scenario, when the user (agent) assigned to a particular configuration signs in to Unified Service Desk, the application selection window is displayed and the user (agent) has to select the Unified Interface App.
