# Use sample applications to get started
To quickly get you started with [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)], sample applications have been provided that you can deploy to your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] instance, and then use to understand how to develop an agent application using [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)].  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The sample applications are not supported for production use.
