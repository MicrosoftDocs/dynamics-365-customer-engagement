# Improve Unified Service Desk
Improvement program data lets [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] send  application-specific information like product usage, health, and performance data to [!INCLUDE[cc_Microsoft](../../includes/cc-microsoft.md)]. We use the information that we collect from the program to analyze and improve the service and product experience for our customers.
  
 The kinds of information that [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] sends anonymously includes:  
  
- Operating system version and bit type.  
  
- Web browser application and version.  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] version.  
  
- Number of monitors used and screen resolution of the primary monitor.  
  
- Device processor class and random-access memory (RAM) details.

- [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] application-specific information. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Telemetry data](../admin/comply-unified-service-desk-data-gdpr.md#telemetry-data)
