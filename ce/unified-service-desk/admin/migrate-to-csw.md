- Focus on your business processes rather than managing the Dynamics 365 Unified Service Desk client desktop.
- Connect with your customers with simplified channel integration for enhanced omnichannel experience.
- Personalize your customer experience using AI.
- Enhance collaboration with native Microsoft Teams integration.
