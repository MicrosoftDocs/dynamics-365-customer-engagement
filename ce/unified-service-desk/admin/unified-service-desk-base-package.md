# Base sample application package



[!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] is a desktop application that helps your customer service agents provide phone, email, and chat support to your customers. [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] provides a configurable framework to quickly build an Agent Desktop application that’s integrated with Microsoft Dataverse. With [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] you can quickly make a customized Agent Desktop application by leveraging the User Interface Integration (UII) framework.  
  
 With the Unified Service Desk Base sample application package, the following components are installed:  
  
- User Interface Integration Solution  
  
- Unified Service Desk Solution  
  
- Data required for Dataverse and customizations
