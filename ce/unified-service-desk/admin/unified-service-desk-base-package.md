# Base sample application package
[!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] is a desktop application that helps your customer service agents provide phone, email, and chat support to your customers. [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] provides a configurable framework to quickly build an Agent Desktop application that’s integrated with [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]. With [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] you can quickly make a customized Agent Desktop application by leveraging the User Interface Integration (UII) framework.  
  
 With the Unified Service Desk Base sample application package, the following components are installed:  
  
-   User Interface Integration Solution  
  
-   Unified Service Desk Solution  
  
-   Data required for [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] and customizations  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The sample applications are not supported for production use.  

  
 Here’s what you’ll see when you install the Base package:  
  
1. **Left Nav**: Opens the left navigation area that you can open or collapse.  
  
2. **Dashboards**: Opens the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] customer service dashboard.  
  
3. **My Work**: Shows a list of all active cases assigned to a service rep.  
  
4. **search**: Opens search for navigating through various entities. For this package you can search for accounts and contacts.  
  
5. **Session tabs**: When you have multiple customer sessions open, each tab shows a different session. The tabs make it easy for an agent to work on multiple customer cases.  
  
6. **Session overview**: Shows relevant information about the customer.  
  
7. **Call Script**: Shows call scripts that the service agent can use when they’re working on a case. The scripts help guide the agent by giving them step-by-step instructions on how to handle the case.  
  
8. **Notes**: This is the area to take notes in regarding the case.
