> [!Note]
> The session that you are working is fine and there is no data lost.

<!--If you  close the CRM entity page, the page starts loading but never completes loading. In this case, you need to close the CRM entity page and reopen the page to continue working.

It is possible that there is not close button on the CRM page tab, in this case, you can close the session tab and reopen the session and CRM entity page to continue working.

If the session tab does not have the close button, you must close the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client application and relaunch the client application, session, and CRM entity page to continue working.-->
