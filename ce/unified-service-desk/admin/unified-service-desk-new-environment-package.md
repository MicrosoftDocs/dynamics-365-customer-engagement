# New Environment sample application package
[!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] is a desktop application that helps your customer service agents provide phone, email, and chat support to your customers. [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] provides a configurable framework to quickly build an Agent Desktop application that’s integrated with [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]. With [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] you can quickly make a customized Agent Desktop application by leveraging the User Interface Integration (UII) framework.  
  
 This package is best used in the following situations:  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] organizations that do not already have a [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] solution installed and need a basic starter solution, which  enables [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] customizers and developers  to add their own customizations and data.  
  
 With the Unified Service Desk New Environment sample application package, the following components are installed:  
  
-   User Interface Integration Solution  
  
-   Unified Service Desk Solution
