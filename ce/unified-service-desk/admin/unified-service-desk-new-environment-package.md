[!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] provides a configurable framework to quickly build an Agent Desktop application thatâ€™s integrated with Microsoft Dataverse. With [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)], you can quickly make a customized Agent Desktop application by using the User Interface Integration (UII) framework.  
 
You can use this package in Dataverse organizations that don't already have a [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] solution installed and need a basic starter solution, so that customizers and developers can add their own customizations and data.

- User Interface Integration Solution  
  
- Unified Service Desk Solution

- Customizations for the Dataverse Unified Interface package
