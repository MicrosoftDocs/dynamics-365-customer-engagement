# How to configure close confirmation window to prevent accidental closure of Unified Service Desk



## Accidental closure of Unified Service Desk 

A key measure at contact centers is customer satisfaction (CSAT). Here, agents strive to increase their CSAT scores by solving customer problems. If you are an agent working on an important case or attending to a customer call and you accidentally close [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)], you could lose your unsaved work as well as the customer call.
