# Unified Interface sample application package



[!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] is a desktop application that helps your customer service agents provide phone, email, and chat support to your customers. [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] provides a configurable framework to quickly build an Agent Desktop application that’s integrated with Microsoft Dataverse. With [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] you can quickly make a customized Agent Desktop application by leveraging the User Interface Integration (UII) framework. 
 This package is best used in the following situations:  
  
- To demonstrate the rich set of customer service capabilities in Dataverse and simplify the customization of your agent desktop application.  
  
  With the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] Unified Interface sample application package, the following components are installed:  
  
    - Unified Service Desk Administrator App

    - User Interface Integration Solution

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> -  The sample applications aren't supported for production use.
>  
> - The sample application installs random sample records for entities like Account, Contact, Cases, and so on.
>
> - The sample application reactivates already resolved cases and sets up the **Customer Satisfaction** and **Average Handling Time**  to random value and closes them. This sample application's data might interfere with your existing records.
>
> - The sample application adds two fields to account (msdyusd_facebook, msdyusd_twitter) and three fields to contact (msdyusd_facebook, msdyusd_twitter, msdyusd_currentprofile) and sets their values randomly.
