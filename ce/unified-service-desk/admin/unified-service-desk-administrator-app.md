### Use package deployer to deploy the Unified Service Desk Administrator app

The [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] Administrator app is available through the **Unified Service Desk - Unified Interface** and **New Environment** sample package. To deploy the sample package, see [Deploy a sample Unified Service Desk package using Package Deployer](../admin/deploy-sample-unified-service-desk-applications-using-package-deployer.md#deploy-a-sample-unified-service-desk-package-using-package-deployer).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - The sample applications are not supported for production use.  
>   - Only one [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] package can be deployed in a instance to avoid any loss or overlap of functionality. If you want to install another [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] package, remove the existing one, and then install the other package. For information about removing an existing [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] package, see [Remove a sample Unified Service Desk package](../../unified-service-desk/admin/deploy-sample-unified-service-desk-applications-using-package-deployer.md#Remove).  
>   - Before deploying a [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] package on a Production instance, ensure that you test the package on a pre-Production instance, preferably a mirror image of the Production instance. Also, be sure to back up the Production instance before deploying the package.  
>   - You can also use [!INCLUDE[pn_PowerShell_short](../../includes/pn-powershell-short.md)] cmdlets for [!INCLUDE[pn_package_deployer_short](../../includes/pn-package-deployer-short.md)] to deploy packages.
