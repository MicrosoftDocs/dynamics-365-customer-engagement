## What's new in Unified Service Desk 4.2

This topic contains information about changes in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] for system administrators available in this version.

### Use Edge WebView2 Process to host web applications in Unified Service Desk

The Edge WebView2 Process browser control hosts your controls in individual Edge WebView2 process instances and displays them in tabs in the Unified Service Desk client application. It facilitates predictable and secure page rendering by making sure that if your web application works in Microsoft Edge, it'll work in Unified Service Desk.

The advantages of using the Edge WebView2 Process hosting method are:

- Available on supported versions of the Windows operating system.
- Highly reliable.
- Easy to configure to host applications in Unified Service Desk.
- Switch seamlessly from one browser to another for your entire organization.
- Enhanced performance and memory optimization.

Also, administrators will be able to perform the following:

- Select Edge WebView2 Process as the hosting type for the organization.
- Select Edge WebView2 Process as the hosting type for select web applications, alongside Chrome process.

More information: [Use EdgeWebView2 Process to host web applications in Unified Service Desk](../edge-webview2-process.md)

### Recover an Edge WebView2 process instance

[!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] can help agents to recover the terminated (crashed) webpages hosted in Edge WebView2 Process in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)].

By default, Edge WebView2 Process instance recovery is enabled.

More information: [Recover an Edge WebView2 process instance](recover-edge-webview2-process-instance.md)

### Pool process instances for Edge WebView2 Process

[!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] always maintains a pool of Edge WebView2 process instances for hosted controls to use. Opening a hosted control using a pooled Edge WebView2 process instance enhances the performance of the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)].

By default, the Edge WebView2 process instance pooling is enabled.

With the Edge WebView2 process instance pooling, every entity page navigation happens inline after the first entity page navigation.

### Use Chrome Process hosting type to host web applications in Unified Service Desk

Use Chrome Process to host web applications in Unified Service Desk client application. The Chrome Process is based on **CefSharp**, an open source framework, which uses the chromium core that powers many modern browsers.

The advantages of using the Chrome process hosting method are as follows:

- Chrome Process is available on different Windows OS versions.
- Chrome Process is highly reliable.
- Easy configurations to host the applications in Unified Service Desk.
- Switch easily from one browser to another for your entire organization.
- Chrome Process pooling feature that reuses the chrome processes and mimics inline navigation provides enhanced performance and memory optimizations.

More information: [Use Chrome Process to host web applications in Unified Service Desk](../chrome-process.md)

### Recover a Chrome Process instance

[!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] can help agents to recover the terminated (crashed) webpages hosted in Chrome Process in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] can help agents to recover the webpages in the following scenarios:

- When Chrome Process closes abruptly.
- When you manually end an unresponsive Chrome Process instance from Task Manager.
- When you manually end an unresponsive Chrome Process instance using a keyboard shortcut.

Chrome Process recovery enables you to recover any Chrome Process instance (which may have more than one webpage) that is unresponsive in the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] application.

By default, Chrome Process instance recovery is enabled. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Recover Chrome Process instance](../../unified-service-desk/admin/recover-chrome-process-instance.md).

### Integrate channel using Channel Integration Framework

Bring your channel providers and integrate them with Unified Service Desk client application using the Channel Integration Framework.

If your organization wants to use the cloud-based channel that you have developed using the [Channel Integration Framework](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/channel-integration-framework/channel-integration-framework), you can integrate the same channel in Unified Service Desk with minimal configuration experience. In turn, this eliminates the need for developing multiple channels. 

The User Interface Integration (UII) framework provides a hosted control - **Channel Integration Framework** - for you to host the channel provider within the Unified Service Desk client application.

More information: [Integrate channel using Channel Integration Framework](../integrate-channel-provider-channel-integration-framework.md)

### Cache-specific configuration for agents

The Configuration Cache Version option causes the client caching feature to retrieve the configuration that has undergone change from the server to the agentâ€™s desktop and avoid retrieving all configurations.

Your organization may have several departments, each with a configuration and agents added to those configurations. Whenever you make a change to one of those configurations, the **Configuration Cache Version** feature helps to download only that specific configuration for which you've made a change. Also, when the agents assigned to other configurations sign in to the client application, the feature doesn't download the configurations, thus improving the startup time of Unified Service Desk. This is also helpful in better application lifecycle management for Unified Service Desk in cases where your organization wants to make changes in your pilot or developer configurations without impacting the production users.

More information: [Cache specific configuration for agents](../admin/set-configuration-cache-version.md)

### Single sign-on for Unified Service Desk

Single sign-on (SSO) for [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] provides an improved startup performance and user experience by authenticating users to access the model-driven apps without the need for entering the credentials multiple times. This eliminates the need for entering the same password again and minimizes the possibility of login errors and ensures a seamless experience.

More information: [Single sign-on (SSO) for Unified Service Desk](../admin/connect-dynamics-365-instance-using-unified-service-desk-client.md#single-sign-on-for-unified-service-desk)
