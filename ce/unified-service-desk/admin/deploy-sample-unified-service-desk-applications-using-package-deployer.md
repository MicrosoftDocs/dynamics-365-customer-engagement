# Overview of Package Deployer and the sample applications
[!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk_for_crm](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk-for-crm.md)] comes with  sample applications that you can use as the base for starting with your configuration of your agent application.  

 These sample applications are bundled as packages that need to be deployed on a [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] instance before you can start working. After deployment, which is done by using [!INCLUDE[pn_package_deployer_long](../../includes/pn-package-deployer-long.md)], the entities and custom code specific to [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] become available in the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] instance.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - The sample applications are not supported for production use.  
>   - Only one [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] package can be deployed in a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] instance to avoid any loss or overlap of functionality. If you want to install another [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] package, remove the existing one, and then install the other package. For information about removing an existing [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] package, see [Remove a sample Unified Service Desk package](../../unified-service-desk/admin/deploy-sample-unified-service-desk-applications-using-package-deployer.md#Remove).  
>   - Before deploying a [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] package on a production instance, ensure that you test the package on a pre-production instance, preferably a mirror image of the production instance. Also, be sure to back up the production instance before deploying the package.  
>   - You can also use [!INCLUDE[pn_PowerShell_short](../../includes/pn-powershell-short.md)] cmdlets for [!INCLUDE[pn_package_deployer_short](../../includes/pn-package-deployer-short.md)] to deploy packages.

<a name="Deploy"></a>   
## Deploy a sample Unified Service Desk package using Package Deployer  

1. [Download](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=872261) the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] package file from the [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Download_Center](../../includes/pn-microsoft-download-center.md)], and save it on your computer.  

2. Run the downloaded file to extract the contents into a folder.  

3. After the files are extracted, the [!INCLUDE[pn_package_deployer_tool](../../includes/pn-package-deployer-tool.md)] starts automatically. If it doesn’t, navigate to the \<*ExtractedFolder*>\USDPackageDeployer folder, and double-click the PackageDeployer.exe file to run the [!INCLUDE[pn_package_deployer_tool](../../includes/pn-package-deployer-tool.md)].  

4. In the introduction screen of the [!INCLUDE[pn_package_deployer_tool](../../includes/pn-package-deployer-tool.md)], choose **Continue**.  

5. In the **Connect to Microsoft Dynamics 365** screen, provide authentication details to connect to the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] instance where you want to deploy the package. If you have multiple organizations, and want to select the organization where you want to deploy the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] package, select the **Display list of available organizations** check box. Choose **Login**.  

   ![Dynamics 365 authentication details sign&#45;in](../../unified-service-desk/media/usd-package-deployer-1.PNG "Dynamics 365 authentication details sign-in")  

6. If you have multiple organizations and chose to select the organization that you want to connect to in the previous step, the next screen displays the list of organizations. Select a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] organization to connect to, and proceed.  

7. On successful authentication, the next screen displays the packages available for deployment. Read the description to determine the package that you want to deploy, select the package, and then choose **Next**.  

8. The next screen displays detailed information about the selected package and the things that will be installed on your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] instance. Review the information, and choose **Next**.  

9. The **Ready to Install** screen displays the package selected for deployment and name of the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] organization where it will be deployed to. Review the information, and choose **Next**.

   ![Package Ready](../../unified-service-desk/media/usd-package-deployer-2.png "Package Ready")

10. The next screen displays the validation status of the package selected to be deployed. After the validation completes successfully, choose **Next**. 

11. The next page displays the package deployment status. You can choose the log link at the bottom-left corner of the screen to view the package deployment log file, PackageDeployer.log. For more information about logging, see [Troubleshoot package deployment issues using log files](../../unified-service-desk/admin/deploy-sample-unified-service-desk-applications-using-package-deployer.md#Logfiles) later in this topic. A confirmation message is displayed on successful deployment of the package. Click **Next**.  

    ![Package deployment status](../../unified-service-desk/media/usd-package-deployer-5.png "Package deployment status")  

12. The next screen displays the name and information about the package that you just deployed. Review the information, and choose **Finish** to exit the [!INCLUDE[pn_package_deployer_tool](../../includes/pn-package-deployer-tool.md)].  

<a name="Remove"></a>   
## Remove a sample Unified Service Desk package  
 When you deploy a sample [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] package in a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] organization, the following three managed solutions are created:

- UiiforMicrosoftDynamicsCRM  

- DynamicsUnifiedServiceDesk  

- USD<em>\<PackageName></em>Customization, where *\<PackageName>* is the name of the package that you deployed.  

  If you want to deploy another sample [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] package, you must first remove these three solutions. To do this:  

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].  

2. On the nav bar, choose **Microsoft Dynamics 365**, and then choose **Settings**.  

3. Choose **Settings** > **Solutions**.  

4. On the Solutions page, select one of the solutions by choosing it, and then choose **Delete**. You are prompted to confirm uninstalling a managed solution. Choose **OK** to proceed.  

   > [!NOTE]
   >  You can’t remove the UiiforMicrosoftDynamicsCRM solution before you remove the DynamicsUnifiedServiceDesk solution because some of the components in the DynamicsUnifiedServiceDesk solution depend on the components in the UiiforMicrosoftDynamicsCRM solution.  

5. After the solution is removed, repeat the steps for the other two solutions to delete them.  

<a name="Logfiles"></a>   
## Troubleshoot package deployment issues using log files  
 The [!INCLUDE[pn_package_deployer_tool](../../includes/pn-package-deployer-tool.md)] provides logging support to record detailed information about errors that can occur while signing in to the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] instance using the tool and deploying packages. There are three log files generated by the tool that are available at the following location on the computer where you run the tool: c:\Users\\*\<UserName>*\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\PackageDeployer\\*\<Version>*.  

- **Login_ErrorLog.log**: This provides information about the issues that occurred while signing in to the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] instance using the tool. If there are any issues while signing in, a message appears on the sign-in screen of the tool with a link to this log file stating that an error occurred while processing the sign-in request and the user can view the error log. You can choose the link in the message to view this log file. The log file is created the first time you encounter any sign-in issues in the tool. Thereafter, the log file records information about any sign-in issues.
