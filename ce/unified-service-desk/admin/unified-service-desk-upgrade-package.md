# Upgrade sample application package



[!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] is a desktop application that helps your customer service agents provide phone, email, and chat support to your customers. [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] provides a configurable framework to quickly build an Agent Desktop application that’s integrated with Microsoft Dataverse. With [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] you can quickly make a customized Agent Desktop application by leveraging the User Interface Integration (UII) framework.  
  
 This package is best used in the following situations:  
  
- Upgrade the existing [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] solutions in the specified Dataverse organization to the latest version without affecting the existing configuration data.  
  
- Configure a new [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] environment without any sample configuration in the Dataverse organization where no [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] solution is currently deployed.  
  
  With the Unified Service Desk Upgrade sample application package, the following components are installed:  
  
- User Interface Integration Solution
