# Upgrade sample application package
[!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] is a desktop application that helps your customer service agents provide phone, email, and chat support to your customers. [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] provides a configurable framework to quickly build an Agent Desktop application thatâ€™s integrated with [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].

- Configure a new [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] environment without any sample configuration in a [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] organization where no [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] solution is currently deployed.
