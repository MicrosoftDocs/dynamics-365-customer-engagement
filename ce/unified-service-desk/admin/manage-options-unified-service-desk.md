# Options for Unified Service Desk

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

Use the **Options** setting in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] (**Settings** > **Unified Service Desk** > **Options**) to manage global name/value pairs that are used by the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] components.  

**To manage [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] options**

1. Sign in to the Unified Service Desk Administrator app. 

2. In the site map under **Advanced Settings**, select **Options**.

3. On the **Active UII Options** page, select **New**.

4. Type the option name and corresponding value on the **New Option** page. Some options are available in the **Global Options** list and some options aren't displayed. To add an option that isn't listed, choose **Others** for the **Global Option** field, and enter the option. The following table describes the options that aren't displayed.

::: moniker range="=dynamics-usd-3"

   |           Option name            |  Value and description  |
   |----------------------------------|--------------------------|
   |     `HideSessionCloseButton`     | Set the value to **True** to hide the close button on the session tabs. If you use this option, you should plan to provide a button or some other method to close a session. You might call the **CloseSession** action on the **Session Tabs** hosted control to close the session. |
   |        `CRM UI Base Url`         | If the URL for accessing Microsoft Dataverse is different from the URL for accessing the web UI, you might need to use this option to specify an override. When a user signs in, the system uses the discovery server to determine the web services endpoints but can only imply the URL used for the UI. This option can be used to specify what the URL should be when accessing the GUI.|
   |     `AutoUseExternalBrowser`     | If this is set to **True**, the system will use the embedded WPF WebBrowser control until the memory reaches a threshold, and then it will switch to opening the browser in an iexplorer.exe process and attaching it to the window. **Warning:** This option is known to cause some issues with security. If you want to activate this mode, it should be thoroughly tested in the target environment. This mode is considered unsupported. |
   |          `MemoryLimit`           | Specify a value in bytes. This specifies the memory limit that the process can use (its working set) before the application refuses to allocate additional browser instances. If this value is specified:<br /><br /> **1.** The **OutOfMemoryThreshold** option will be ignored.<br />**2.** If the **AutoUseExternalBrowser** option is true, the value specified for **MemoryLimit** will be the memory limit that will trigger the application to open the browser externally. |
   |      `OutOfMemoryThreshold`      | This is a threshold value beyond which the application will refuse to allocate additional browser instances. This value is specified in bytes and is subtracted from the maxworkingset value to determine how much memory is allowed for the process. If the **AutoUseExternalBrowser** option is true, this will be the memory limit that will trigger the application to open the browser externally.|
   |  `MaxReplacementParameterDepth`  | Specifies how deeply replacement parameters can be nested in an expression. Specify an integer value for this option.<br /><br /> Consider an example where you have the following replacement parameters:<br /><br /> `Str3 = "Level 3"`<br /><br /> `Str2 = "Level 2 – [[Str3]v]"`<br /><br /> `Str1 = "TopLevel – [[Str2]v]"`<br /><br /> In this example, in the following expression:<br /><br /> `Value = [[Str1]]`<br /><br /> `Value` results in `"TopLevel - Level 2 - Level 3"`.<br /><br /> In the preceding expression, the depth of the nesting of the replacement parameters is **2**.<br /><br /> [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Use replacement parameters to configure Unified Service Desk](../../unified-service-desk/use-replacement-parameters-configure-unified-service-desk.md) |
   |        `GenericListener`         | Specify a custom URL for the generic listener port. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Change the port of generic listener](../../unified-service-desk/use-generic-listener-adapter-unified-service-desk.md#ChangePort) |
   |        `ShowScriptErrors`        | Specify whether to display (**True**) or suppress (**False**) script errors in webpages displayed in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]. If you don't specify the `ShowScriptErrors` option for the Dataverse instance, the value is assumed to be **False**, which implies that the script errors aren't displayed in the client application. |
   |     `EntitySearchPageCount`      | Specify an integer value to override the default page count (records displayed per page) value of 50 for the [DoSearch](../../unified-service-desk/global-manager-hosted-control.md#DoSearch) action. |
   |    `ClientCacheVersionNumber`    | Enables client caching in Unified Service Desk. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Configure client caching in Unified Service Desk](../../unified-service-desk/admin/configure-client-caching-unified-service-desk.md) |
   |      `maxNumberOfSessions`       | Indicates the maximum number of simultaneous sessions that each user can open with the Unified Service Desk client. An error message is displayed to users when they exceed the specified simultaneous session limit. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Session management in Unified Service Desk](../../unified-service-desk/session-management-unified-service-desk.md) |
   |  `ProcessTerminationThreshold`   | Indicates the timeout period for the duration (in ms) that the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] monitoring process (usdmp.exe) waits before terminating an unresponsive [!INCLUDE[pn_Internet_Explorer](../../includes/pn-internet-explorer.md)] process, which also causes [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] to become unresponsive. Valid values range from 0 through 30,000. If this is set to 0, the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] monitoring process won't start and won't monitor [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] for unresponsive behavior. If this is set to any other value within the range, [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] automatically starts the monitoring process. The default value is 5,000 ms (5 seconds). [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [IE Process hosting method](../../unified-service-desk/ie-process.md) |
   |         `HelpImproveUSD`         | Enables the organization-wide setting that allows user agents to send improvement program information to Microsoft. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Improve Unified Service Desk](../../unified-service-desk/admin/help-improve-unified-service-desk.md) |
   |   `IEProcessKeyboardShortcut`    | For page and standard web application components that use the IE Process hosting type, users can move out of the current IE Process hosted control by selecting **Alt**+**0**.  If the **Alt**+**0** key combination is assigned as a shortcut in another application, you can use the `IEProcessKeyboardShortcut` option to assign a different key combination for moving out of an IE Process hosted control, such as **Alt**+**r**. <br/>**Note**:  We recommend that you not include the Ctrl key with the `IEProcessKeyBoardShortcut` option, because it can cause unexpected navigation in the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client. This is a known issue with Windows Presentation Foundation. |
   |    `PopupNavigationShortcut`     | By default, you can select **Alt**+**1** to navigate through all active notifications. [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] administrators can use the `PopupNavigationShortcut` option to assign a different key combination. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Configure notifications in Unified Service Desk](../configure-notifications-unified-service-desk.md) |
   |    `PanelNavigationShortcut`     | By default, you can select **Ctrl**+**0** to navigate through all active panels. [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] administrators can use the `PanelNavigationShortcut` option to assign a different key combination. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Keyboard shortcuts for panels](../keyboard-shortcuts-panels.md) |
   |       `IEWebPageRecovery`        | This option recovers an unresponsive Internet Explorer webpage. By default, `IEWebPageRecovery` is enabled. Set the value to **False** to disable `IEWebPageRecovery`. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Recover Internet Explorer process instance](../admin/recover-internet-explorer-process-instance.md) |
   |   `IEWebPageInactivityTimeout`   | Indicates the timeout period for the duration (in ms) that [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] waits before displaying a message. The default value is 15,000 (15 seconds). If this is set to 0, [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] disables the `IEWebPageInactivityTimeout`. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Recover Internet Explorer process instance](../admin/recover-internet-explorer-process-instance.md) |
   | `On-DemandIETerminationShortcut` | Use a keyboard shortcut to terminate an unresponsive Internet Explorer webpage. The default keyboard shortcut is **Ctrl**+**Alt**+**K**. To change the default, enter it in the form ***Key1*+*Key2*+*Key3***. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Recover Internet Explorer process instance](../admin/recover-internet-explorer-process-instance.md) </br>**Note:**</br> **1.** The agent must use the keyboard shortcut as a last option when the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] monitoring process fails to detect the unresponsive Internet Explorer process instance.</br> **2.** Using the keyboard shortcut might terminate any responsive Internet Explorer webpage, causing you to lose unsaved work.</br> |
   |    `InternetExplorerPooling`     | If this is set to **True**, you can experience enhanced performance of CRM entity page loading and faster inline navigation in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]. That is, the hosted control uses an Internet Explorer instance from the pool, which performs inline navigation. By default, the `InternetExplorerPooling` is disabled (**False**). [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Performance enhancement for loading the model-driven app pages](../admin/performance-enhancement-CRM-entity-page-loads.md) |
   |     `TotalRecordCountLimit`      | This value is for [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] to determine the batch size while fetching entity records from the Dataverse instance. The default value of the `TotalRecordCountLimit` in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] and in the MSCRM\_CONFIG database is 5,000. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Configure Unified Service Desk entities](../understand-unified-service-desk-concepts.md)<br>**Note:** <br> **1.** The `TotalRecordCountLimit` value must be equal to the value in the MSCRM\_CONFIG database.<br>**2.** You must not change the default value unless the MSCRM\_CONFIG database administrator changes the value. |
   |            **Others**            | This option allows you to enter one of the global options listed in this table that doesn't appear in the **Global Options** list. |
