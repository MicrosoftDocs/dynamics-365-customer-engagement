# Unified Service Desk configuration walkthroughs

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

Each walkthrough in this section covers an area or a combination of areas in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk_for_crm](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk-for-crm.md)]. These walkthroughs are arranged in increasing order of complexity so it may benefit you to do them in sequence. Also, you must complete [Walkthrough 1: Build a simple agent application](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough-1-build-a-simple-agent-application.md) first because it sets up the base application that the other walkthroughs, except walkthrough 8, are built on. Walkthrough 8 is a standalone walkthrough, and does not require any other walkthroughs to be completed before using it.  
  
 These walkthroughs are created using the “New Environment” sample application package deployed on Customer Engagement (on-premises). Before you begin these walkthroughs, ensure that you have deployed one of the sample [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] applications, have installed the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client application, and have appropriate security access in Microsoft Dataverse to configure [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] entities.
