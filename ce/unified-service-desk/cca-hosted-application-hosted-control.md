# CCA Hosted Application (Hosted Control)
A Customer Care Accelerator (CCA) hosted application hosted control enables you to host an external application or web application in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] and interact with it by using the [UII adapters](../unified-service-desk/uii-adapters.md). It is also used for hosting the control that connects [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] with a [!INCLUDE[pn_computer_telephony_integration_cti](../includes/pn-computer-telephony-integration-cti.md)] system.  
  
 This type of hosted control also provides the link to traditional CCA hosted applications. For more information about building a CCA hosted application, see the see the **CCA Deployment Guide** in the [!INCLUDE[pn_user_inteface_integration_uii](../includes/pn-user-interface-integration-uii.md)] SDK [download package](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=519179).

## Create a CCA Hosted Application hosted control  
 You create a hosted control type of **CCA Hosted Application** to host a [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)] hosted application. A [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)] hosted application is a user control that can be used to host external, web, remote and custom applications within [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]. For information about using [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)] hosted applications, see [Integrate with external applications and web applications](../unified-service-desk/integrate-external-applications-web-applications.md).  
  
 While creating a new hosted control, the fields in the **New Hosted Control** screen vary based on the type of hosted control you want to create. For detailed information about the information that you need to specify for each field for creating a **CCA Hosted Application** type of hosted control, see [Create and manage UII hosted applications](../unified-service-desk/create-manage-uii-hosted-applications.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The **CCA Hosted Application** hosted control type has a number of limitations as it relates to the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] functionality. In particular, these hosted controls don’t fire events. While it’s possible for these controls to fire events into [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)], it isn’t automatic like it would be for other [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] hosted controls.

## Predefined UII actions  
 The developer of the [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)] hosted application decides which actions should be added to the control.
