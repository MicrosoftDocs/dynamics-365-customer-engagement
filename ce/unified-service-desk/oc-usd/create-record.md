# Create a record in Omnichannel for Customer Service

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

If no records are linked to a conversation in Omnichannel for Customer Service, you can create a record by using the quick create option. To use this option, select the plus sign (**+**). After you create the record, the record is automatically linked to the conversation.

## Create a record

1. Select the plus sign (**+**) to create a record.
 
 > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
 > ![Quick create record.](../../customer-service/media/quick-create-record.png "Quick create record")

2. Select a record type from the list.<br>
    - Case
    - Contact
    - Account

    A page for the new record appears on the **Application management** toolbar.

3. Specify the details on the page, and then save your changes.
