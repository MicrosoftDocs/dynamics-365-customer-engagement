# View omnichannel conversations and omnichannel session in model-driven apps

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

In your organization, some agents might work in a contact center that uses Omnichannel for Customer Service, whereas other agents work in a different contact center that uses Microsoft model-driven apps, such as Omnichannel for Customer Service app. In this case, if you're an agent who works in the ,model-driven 365 apps, and you must analyze a conversation request from Omnichannel for Customer Service, you can find the information through **activities** in model-driven apps.

You can find the following activity types in model-driven apps apps:

 - Conversation form

 - Omnichannel session

## Conversation form

The conversation form displays information about a conversation request.
