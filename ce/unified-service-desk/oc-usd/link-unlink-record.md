# Link and unlink a record to the conversation

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

The topic explains how to link and unlink a record to the conversation.

## Link a record to the conversation when doing inline search

During inline search, the search results are displayed, and you can select a record to link the conversation to the selected record. After you link the record, the **Customer summary** form loads with the details.

> [!Note]
> You can link only one contact or account in the **Customer profile** section and one case in the **Issue snapshot** section.


## Unlink a record from the conversation

You can unlink a record only when you are interacting with customer using the communication panel. That is, after you accept an incoming conversation request and view the **Customer summary** page, you can unlink the record from the conversation.

To unlink a record, select the **X** button next to the customer name in the **Customer profile** form. After the record is removed, the **Customer profile** form is blank.
