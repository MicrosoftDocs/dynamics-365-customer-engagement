# Debug your custom code for Unified Service Desk



Using custom code for extending [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] involves compiling your custom code into an assembly (DLL file), and then distributing the assembly to the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client installation directory on each client computer.  
  
Debugging your custom code for [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] requires access to the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client application and Microsoft Dataverse instance with [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] solutions deployed.  
  
 To effectively debug your custom code, set your Visual Studio project properties to:  
  
- Ensure that the latest version of the assembly is copied to the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client installation directory every time you build your [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio_short](../includes/pn-visual-studio-short.md)] project so that you are testing the executable (the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client application) using the latest code.  

- Specify the executable or the calling application (the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client application) for debugging your code.  

  To do so:  

1. In your [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio_short](../includes/pn-visual-studio-short.md)] project, from the **Project** menu, select **<Project_Name> Properties**.  
  
2. On the **Build** tab, under the **Output** area, set the **Output path** field value to the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client installation directory, typically C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics CRM USD\USD\\.  
  
   ![Set the output path of the assembly.](../unified-service-desk/media/usd-project-build-tab.png "Set the output path of the assembly")  
  
3. On the **Debug** tab, select **Start external program**, and specify the full path to the `UnifiedServiceDesk.exe` file in the field, typically C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics CRM USD\USD\ UnifiedServiceDesk.exe  
  
   ![Set the external application name.](../unified-service-desk/media/usd-project-debug-tab.png "Set the external application name")  
  
4. Save your project.  
  
    This ensures that the latest version of the assembly is copied to the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client installation directory every time you build your project, and the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client application is automatically started when you debug your project.  
  
5. Set breakpoints in your Visual Studio project as required, and then build/debug your project.  
  
    When the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client application starts automatically on debugging the project, specify the credentials to connect to your Dataverse instance to continue with the debugging session until you hit a breakpoint or issue in your code.  
  
   Additionally, the **Debug Output** tab of the Debugger hosted control in the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client application provides real time trace information of the underlying execution, which can be also used to debug your custom code. For more information, see [Debug issues in Unified Service Desk](debug-issues-unified-service-desk.md)  
  
   The Debugger hosted control comes pre-configured if you have deployed one of the sample [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] packages. Alternatively, you can easily set up the Debugger hosted control in your [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] deployment. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Walkthrough 6: Configure the Debugger hosted control in your agent application](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough-configure-debugger-hosted-control-agent-application.md)
