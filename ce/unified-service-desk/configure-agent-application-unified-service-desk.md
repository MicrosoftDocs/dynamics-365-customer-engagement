# Overview of configuring agent application

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

This section provides information about how you can use [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] to quickly configure a highly customized agent application for your organization without using code.  
  
 Before you start configuring your agent application using [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)], you must install and deploy it. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Install, upgrade, and deploy Unified Service Desk](admin/install-upgrade-deploy-unified-service-desk.md)  
  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] uses the Microsoft Dataverse security model to govern access to the entities and configuration data. You can also create configurations in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] to group entities, and assign them to users to ensure that they can access only the entities in the assigned configuration.
