# Release notes of Unified Service Desk 3.3

This section describes the known issues and limitations in [!INCLUDE[pn-unified-service-desk-3-3](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk-3-3.md)]

## Known issues in Unified Service Desk

### Best Practices Analyzer

- **Warning for HelpImproveUSD parameter in Dynamics 365 (on-premises)**

  Help Improve [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] is enabled/disabled only for [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)]. If you are using [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-onprem](../includes/pn-crm-onprem.md)], you can see a warning for the Help Improve [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] (HelpImproveUSD) parameter in the report.

- **Error for Enable Enhanced Protected mode in Windows 7 operating system**

  If you are using [!include[pn-windows-7](../includes/pn-windows-7.md)] operating system, the **Enable Enhanced Protected Mode** option is not available in Internet Explorer options. Hence, you can see an error message for the **Enable Enhanced Protected Mode** parameter in the report.

### Provide Feedback

- **Insufficient permissions to provide feedback**

  The **Provide Feedback** feature is available only if you have a [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] instance.

  If you log in using administrator credentials and select **Provide Feedback** to provide your feedback/comments, you can see an **Insufficient Permissions** message. 

  ![Insufficient Permissions](media/insufficient-permissions-provide-feedback-window.PNG "Insufficient Permissions")

  The message says to contact the administrator even though you log in as an administrator. The reason for this message is that you did not enable the **HelpImproveUsd** option in the UII global options.

  If you enable **HelpImproveUsd**, the data collection is enabled, and in turn, you (agent and administrator) can provide feedback to improve the product.

  To enable **HelpImproveUsd**, view [Help improve Unified Service Desk](admin/help-improve-unified-service-desk.md).

## Limitations in Unified Service Desk

This section describes the limitations in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]

### RunScript

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This also applies to:
> - [!INCLUDE[pn-unified-service-desk-3-2](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk-3-2.md)]
> - [!INCLUDE[pn-unified-service-desk-3-1](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk-3-1.md)]
> - [!INCLUDE[pn-unified-service-desk-3-0](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk-3-0.md)]
> - [!INCLUDE[pn-unified-service-desk-2-2](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk-2-2.md)]

**RunScript action does not execute if the tab or page is not in focus**

If you execute a RunScript action on a tab or a page that is not in focus, the execution of RunScript action does not execute the script.

**Example:**

Accounts and Contacts tabs are open and focus is on Accounts tab. You execute `window.close()` RunScript command to close the Contacts tab. Since, the focus is on Accounts tab the RunScript execution does not execute and the Contacts tab does not close.

**Workaround:**

If you open several tabs and want to execute a RunScript action on a tab that is not in focus, set the focus on the tab you want to work and then execute the RunScript action.

### Performance enhancement for CRM entity page loads

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This also applies to:
> - [!INCLUDE[pn-unified-service-desk-3-2](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk-3-2.md)]

**Closing CRM entity page starts loading but never completes loading**

When **InternetExplorerPooling** is enabled, and if you close a CRM entity page hosted in Unified Service Desk using the close (**x**) button (_see Image 1_), the CRM entity page to starts loading but never completes loading (_see Image 2_).

  _Image 2: CRM entity page start loading but never completes loading_

**Workaround**

If you close the CRM entity page, the page starts loading but never completes the loading. In this case, to restore the CRM entity page, right-click on CRM entity page and select **Forward** from the context menu (_see Image 1_).

> [!Note]
> The session that you are working is fine and there is no data loss.

### Clicking back button in a session does not perform navigation to original URL

If you open any webpage in the browser with hosted controls using IE Process hosting method, the webpage opens in a new window within the same-hosted control overlaying the existing page/window. 

Since the webpage is opened in the new window within the same hosted control overlaying the existing page or window, clicking the back button in the webpage does not perform the navigation back to the original page. This behavior is that the new window does not have any history to navigate back to the original page.

**Workaround**

Configure **Show Outside** action call to show the webpage in an **IE process** outside of the hosted control space in the popup window.

#### Step 1: Configure ShowOutside action call

In this step, you will create an action call to show the webpage.

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].
2. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_usd](../includes/proc-settings-usd.md)]
3. Clikc **Action Calls**.
4. Click **+ New**.
5. On the **New Action Call** page, specify the following values.
  
   | Field | Value |
   |----------|-----------|
   |Name | Show Outside |
   |Hosted Control | CRM Global Manager|
   |Action| LaunchURL|
   |Data| [[SUBJECTURL]]|

   ![Show outside Action Call](media/show-outside-action-call.PNG "Show outside Action Call")
6. Click **Save**.

#### Step 2: Configure Window Navigation Rules and add the Action Call

In this step you will create a navigation rule and set the order before other default rules. After creating the navigation rule, add the **ShowOutside** action call that you created in Step 1 to the **Show Outside Rule** window navigation rule.

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].
2. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_usd](../includes/proc-settings-usd.md)]
3. Click **Window Navigation Rules**.
4. Click **+ New**.
5. On the **New Window Navigation Rules** page, specify the following values.

   | Field | Value |
   |-------------|----------------|
   |Name| Show Outside Rule|
   |Order | 1 <br> **Note:** You can specify any order that is lesser than the default list of Window Navigation Rules. |
   | Url | https://www.bing.com <br> **Note:** You must to specify a URL to which you want to navigate.|
   |Route Type | Popup |
   | Destination | Tab |
   |Action | None |

   ![Show outside Window Navigation Rule](media/show-outside-navigation-rule.PNG "Show outside Window Navigation Rule")

6. Click **Save**.
7. On the nav bar, click the down arrow next to **Show Outside Rule**, and click **Actions**.
8. On the next page, click **ADD EXISTING ACTION CALL**, type **Show Outside** in the search bar, and then press **ENTER** or click the search icon.
9. Click **Save**.

The configuration of action call and window navigation rule is completed. If you now open a webpage, the webpage opens as a popup in a new window.
