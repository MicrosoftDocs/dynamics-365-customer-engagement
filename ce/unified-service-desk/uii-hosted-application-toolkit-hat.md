# UII Hosted Application Toolkit (HAT) in Unified Service Desk
The [!INCLUDE[pn_hosted_application_toolkit_hat](../includes/pn-hosted-application-toolkit-hat.md)] facilitates the task of automating the user interface (UI) of a hosted application. It consists of data-driven adapters (DDA), descriptive bindings, and automations ([!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Windows_short](../includes/pn-ms-windows-short.md)] workflows) to automate the applications. In addition, [!INCLUDE[pn_user_inteface_integration_uii](../includes/pn-user-interface-integration-uii.md)] contains the [!INCLUDE[pn_hosted_application_toolkit_hat](../includes/pn-hosted-application-toolkit-hat.md)] Software Factory thatâ€™s used to create an application hosting solution in [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio](../includes/pn-visual-studio.md)].  
  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_hat](../includes/pn-hat.md)] contains tools that can be used to configure hosted applications, such as external, web, or [!INCLUDE[pn_Java](../includes/pn-java.md)] applications, and make them available to a [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)] desktop, such as [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]. [!INCLUDE[pn_hat](../includes/pn-hat.md)] uses [!INCLUDE[pn_windows_workflow_foundation_wf](../includes/pn-windows-workflow-foundation-wf.md)] and an extensible UI integration framework to provide application automation for [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)]. Workflows created for [!INCLUDE[pn_hat](../includes/pn-hat.md)] are referred to as *automations*, and the extensible application framework components are referred to as *data-driven adapters (DDAs)*. [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)] ships with four DDAs.
