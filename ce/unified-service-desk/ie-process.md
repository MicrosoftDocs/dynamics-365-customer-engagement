# Use IE Process to host web applications (discontinued)

[!INCLUDE[cc_internet_explorer_deprecation](../../ce/includes/cc-internet-explorer-deprecation.md)]

The `IE Process` browser control hosts your controls in individual [!INCLUDE[pn_Internet_Explorer](../includes/pn-internet-explorer.md)] process instances, and displays them in tabs in the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client application. It facilitates predictable page rendering by making sure that if your web application works in [!INCLUDE[pn_Internet_Explorer](../includes/pn-internet-explorer.md)], it'll work in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]. You can select **IE Process** as the hosting method for the **CRM Dialog**, **CRM Page**, **KM Control**, **Unified Interface Page**, **Unified Interface KMControl**, and **Standard Web Application** type of hosted controls.

 ![Hosting type in Unified Service Desk.](../unified-service-desk/media/crm-itpro-usd-samplehostedcontrol.PNG "Hosting type in Unified Service Desk")

To use the **IE Process** browser control, you must select the **Enable Protected Mode** check box for the **Local Intranet** security zone in Internet Explorer. More information: [What does Internet Explorer protected mode do?](https://windows.microsoft.com/windows-vista/What-does-Internet-Explorer-protected-mode-do)

If it is not feasible to enable protected mode for intranet sites, then you must add the following URLs to the **Restricted Sites** security zone in Internet Explorer:

- `http://close`
- `http://event`
- `http://uii`

If you do not enable the protected mode for the **Local Intranet** security zone or add the above URLs to the **Restricted Sites** security zone, blank pages with `http://event?eventname=usdreload` in the address bar will pop up for users when they work in the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client.

## Memory and performance enhancements

The `IE Process` browser control offers the following memory and performance enhancements.

### Better memory management

[!INCLUDE[pn_Internet_Explorer](../includes/pn-internet-explorer.md)] process instances used for hosting your webpages are now hosted outside of the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] process instance. This significantly reduces the memory footprint of [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] when you display or work with multiple controls at the same time within the client application.

### Improved stability and performance

The [!INCLUDE[pn_Internet_Explorer](../includes/pn-internet-explorer.md)] process instances used for hosting your webpages are isolated from each other so that when a hosted control becomes unresponsive in the client application, all the other hosted control tabs along with the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client application continue to remain operational. Also, the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] Monitoring Process (usdmp.exe) service continuously monitors the health of [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)],  and terminates any browser process instances that are unresponsive and causing [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] to freeze. If a browser process instance isn’t responding, but [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] is responsive, the browser process instance won’t be terminated.

Use the `ProcessTerminationThreshold` option in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] to specify the timeout period for the duration (in milliseconds) that the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] Monitoring Process (usdmp.exe) service waits before terminating an unresponsive [!INCLUDE[pn_Internet_Explorer](../includes/pn-internet-explorer.md)] process that's causing [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] to become unresponsive. Valid range is between 0 and 30000. If set to 0, the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] Monitoring Process (usdmp.exe) service won't start, and won't monitor [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] for unresponsive behavior. If set to any other value within the range, [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] automatically starts the monitoring process. The default value is 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds). For more information about setting this option, see [Manage Options for Unified Service Desk](admin/manage-options-unified-service-desk.md).

> [!NOTE]
> When you create an instance of a **CRM Dialog**, **CRM Page**, **KM Control**, or **Standard Web Application** type of hosted control, the **Hosting Type** field in the `New Hosted Control` form is set to `IE Process` as the default option. Previously, `Internal WPF` used to be the default hosting type option. You can select **Internal WPF** instead for your hosted control, if required.
