# Deploy the hosted application to Unified Service Desk



Once you have created a hosted application as described in [Create a HAT hosted application project](../unified-service-desk/use-hat-software-factory-create-hosted-application.md#Create), you can deploy it to [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]. [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] is configured on Microsoft Dataverse server. You must ensure that all workflow-dependent applications that contain a default workflow include the workflow assembly (.dll file). If the assembly file isn’t found or is deleted, the `Type` field in the Action XML is set to `NULL`.  
  
<a name="deploy"></a>   
## Deploy your hosted application to Unified Service Desk  
  
1. Right-click the application in **Solution Explorer** and select **Deploy**.  
  
   ![Use the shortcut menu to configure.](../unified-service-desk/media/usd-create-hat-control-11.png "Use the shortcut menu to configure")  
  
2. In the next dialog box, enter Dataverse server name and your credentials.  
    
3. If there is more than one organization, check the **Display list of available organizations** check box and select **Login**.  
  
4. Select your organization from the list of organizations displayed and select **OK**.  
  
<a name="verify"></a>   
## Verify that the application is successfully deployed  
  
1. Sign in to Unified Service Desk Administrator.  
  
2. Select **Hosted Controls** under **Basic Settings**.  
  
3. From the list of hosted controls, select the hosted application you just deployed. In this case, it’s [!INCLUDE[pn_bing](../includes/pn-bing.md)] Search. 
  
4. The configuration information for the hosted application is displayed.  
  
   ![Hosted control information dialog box.](../unified-service-desk/media/usd-deploy-test-hosted-control-info.PNG "Hosted control information dialog box")  
  
6. The bindings you created in [Use UII inspector to create bindings for the hosted application](../unified-service-desk/use-uii-inspector-create-bindings-hosted-application.md) are displayed in the Automation XML area.  
  
   ![Automation bindings.](../unified-service-desk/media/usd-automation-xml.PNG "Automation bindings")  
  
7. Copy the assembly that you generated in [Create a HAT hosted application project](../unified-service-desk/use-hat-software-factory-create-hosted-application.md#Create) from your [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio_short](../includes/pn-visual-studio-short.md)] project output folder (\<ProjectFolder>\bin\debug) to the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] application directory. In this case, we will copy the Bing Search.dll file to the c:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics CRM USD\USD directory.
