# Preview feature: Unified Interface Page (Hosted Control)
Use the **Unified Interface Page** hosted control type to load a URL or page from Unified Interface Apps in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. When a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] page is loaded within a hosted control of this type, it will automatically scan the page for data from the entity, and automatically populate the replacement parameters.
  
 This hosted control type exposes a number of predefined UII actions and events that are unique to handling of [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] [!INCLUDE[pn-ms-windows-short](../includes/pn-ms-windows-short.md)] including list manipulation actions, and a find action for displaying a quick search or advanced search page.

## Create a Unified Interface Page hosted control

While creating a new hosted control, the fields in the New Hosted Control screen vary based on the type of hosted control you want to create. This section provides information about the specific fields that are unique to the Unified Interface Page hosted control type.

In the New Hosted Control screen:

- Under **[!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]** area, select **Unified Interface Page** from the **USD Component Type** drop-down list.

- Select **Pre-fetch Data** to load related information for an entity record in the context along with the entity record page without having to wait for the full entity web page to load in the client application. The fetched entity information is populated in the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] context thus enabling any hosted control to quickly display relevant entity information on the client application. This could help agents instantly act or kick start discussion with customers, and save crucial interaction time.

- From the **Allow Multiple Pages** drop-down list, select **No** (default) to replace the Dynamics 365 page that is currently displayed, and update the browser history when [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] receives a navigate action call or a page is routed to the tab. Select **Yes** to automatically create a drop-down list when a second URL is called or a window navigation rule directs a page to the tab. This allows the user to quickly search between the Dynamics 365 pages that are attached to this control. Also, when you select **Yes**, an additional field, **Maximum Browsers**, becomes available where you can specify the maximum number of pages to be displayed in the drop-down list.

- Under the **Common Properties** area, select the **Application is Global** check box to set the hosted control as global. Global hosted controls can be displayed outside of a customer session. Controls like the agentsâ€™ dashboard, wall or search are common uses for global hosted controls. Global hosted controls do not have session-specific state so when you change sessions, these same global hosted controls remain. If the check box is not selected, the hosted control becomes session based. Session-based controls exist in the context of the customer session. If the user changes to another session, all the session pages from the previous session are hidden.

- The **Display Group** field displays the panel where this hosted control will be displayed. **MainPanel** is the most common for this hosted control type.

For information about other **General** fields, see Create or edit a hosted control.

# Predefined UII actions

These are the predefined actions for this hosted control type.

## AssociatedView

This action loads a specific associated view of Dynamics 365. These views are typically accessed by clicking down arrow next to an entity record name in the nav bar, and selecting the associated entities.

| Parameter         | Description                                                                                                             |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| etn               | The name of the entity for which you want to load list of records of the associated entity.  This is a mandatory parameter|
| Id                | The ID of the main entity record for which to display the associated entity records.                                    |
| navItemId         | Id of the navigation item corresponding to the associated entity. More information: [formContext.ui.navigation](../developer/clientapi/reference/formcontext-ui-navigation.md)      |
| hideCommandBar    | If this parameter is supplied and False, the page will be displayed along with the Dynamics 365 command bar. |
| hideNavigationBar | If this parameter is supplied and False, the page will be displayed along with the Dynamics 365 navigation bar.     |

## Close

This action is used to close the hosted control. Unlike the **CloseActive** action, if this tab (hosted control) is displaying more than one page, it will close all the pages displayed in the tab in your agent application.

## CloseActive

This action is used to close the active window within this hosted control. If the active window is the only window displayed in the hosted control, the hosted control itself will be closed. For **Unified Interface Page** type of hosted controls that do not allow multiple pages (**Allow Multiple Pages** = No), this action is equivalent to the **Close** action.

## CloseAndPrompt

This action closes the hosted control, but prompts the user to save or abandon the changes before closing.

## Find

Navigate to the quick find list view of the specified entity.

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Parameter</strong></th>
<th><strong>Description</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td></td>
<td>The data parameter should specify the entity logical name of the quick find list view to display. There are some special case values:<br />
- Use <strong>case</strong> or <strong>incident</strong> to display the quick find list view for cases.<br />
- Use <strong>activities</strong> or <strong>activity</strong> to display the quick find list view for activities.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## New\_CRM\_Page

Creates a page for creating a new Dynamics 365 record of the entity specified, and treats the page as a popup from the specified hosted control. The window navigation rules are evaluated to determine the location where the page to create the entity record is displayed.

| Parameter   | Description                                                 |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| LogicalName | The logical name of the entity for creating a new instance. |

Note

The rest of the parameters should consist of name=value pairs. These are the additional pre-populated values in the form for creating a new record for the specified entity. 

### Open\_CRM\_Page

Opens an existing instance of the entity specified and identified by the ID, and treats the page as a popup from the specified hosted control. The window navigation rules are evaluated to determine the location where the popup should be displayed.

| Parameter   | Description                             |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------|
| LogicalName | The logical name of the entity to open. |
| id          | The ID of the entity record to open.    |

### Popup

### RealignWindow

Displays the hosted control at the specified location on a monitor. You can display hosted control on up to two monitors. This action is applicable for hosted control instances that are configured to be placed on a USDFloatingPanel or USDFloatingToolPanel panel type.

| Parameter | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| screen    | Specifies the screen on which to display the hosted control. Valid values are 1 or 2. If you donâ€™t specify this parameter, 1 is passed by default.                                                                                  |
| left      | Specifies the position, in percentage, from the left of the screen on the target monitor where the hosted control should be displayed. Valid values are 0 through 100. If you donâ€™t specify this parameter, 0 is passed by default. |
| top       | Specifies the position, in percentage, from the top of the screen on the target monitor where the hosted control should be displayed. Valid values are 0 through 100. If you donâ€™t specify this parameter, 0 is passed by default.  |
| width     | Specifies the width, in percentage, of the hosted control window on the target monitor. Valid values are 1 through 100. If you donâ€™t specify this parameter, 100 is passed by default.                                              |
| height    | Specifies the height, in percentage, of the hosted control window on the target monitor. Valid values are 1 through 100. If you donâ€™t specify this parameter, 100 is passed by default.                                             |

### Refresh

This action refreshes the current page.

### RunScript  
 This action injects JavaScript into the main frame of the application. You should avoid using [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] client SDK calls with this action; instead, use the **RunXrmCommand** action.  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
||The data parameter is the JavaScript that will be injected into the form. **Note:**  The replacement parameters can be used in the script, and they will be replaced before the script is executed.|
| Frame | When frames exist on the page, this parameter would specify the name of the frame to inject the JavaScript. |

  
### RunXrmCommand  
 This action is used to run JavaScript code that uses [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] [Client API Reference](../developer/clientapi/reference.md) into the Unified Interface Pages (entity forms and grids). 

 You must configure the script as a function of [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] JavaScript webResource. The function's first parameter is a context parameter (reserved parameter) which may have one of the following values:

 - [FormContext](../developer/clientapi/clientapi-form-context.md) on entity form pages
 - [GridContext](../developer/clientapi/clientapi-grid-context.md) on entity grid pages
 - **undefined** on other pages
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|
| webResourceName | Name of the web resource in which the JavaScript function you want to execute is present. |
| functionName | Name of the function. |

The other parameters to the function are customer defined and can be used to pass Unified Service Deskâ€™s replacement parameters at runtime. This action accepts a list of optional parameters without keys. The list of optional parameters are passed as arguments in the same order from second position after context replacement at runtime.

#### Example

You want to execute **RunXrmCommand** action to fill the form attributes of a entity form, where the entity form is hosted by Unified Interface type of hosted control. The value you want to fill in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]'s perspective  is a replacement parameter - `[[$Context.Key1]]`.

In order to execute the action, you need to write JavaScript type web resource (say webResource1), and then write a function in the web resource.

```JavaScript
function fillAttributeValue(context, attrValue)
{
 context.getAttribute(<attributeName>).setValue(attrValue);
} Â Â 
```

You need to configure the data in the action call as follows:

```
webResourceName = webResource1
functionName = fillAttributeValue
â€˜[[$Context.Key1]]â€™
```
> [!Note]
> In the above example, observe the quotes around the replacement parameter - `[[$Context.Key1]]`. [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] considers only the value of the parameter (not the data type) and passes all the characters in context replaced value to the JavaScript function. You must be cautious and take care of the data type while configuring.

### SetSize

This action explicitly sets the width and height of the hosted control. This is particularly useful when using "auto" in your panel layouts.

| Parameter | Description                       |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| width     | The width of the hosted control.  |
| height    | The height of the hosted control. |

### SaveAndClose

This action saves the dirty data on the Dynamics 365 form, and closes the hosted control.

### SaveAll

This action saves all forms in hosted control that allows multiple pages to be displayed (**Allow Multiple Pages** = Yes). If the hosted control allows only a single page to be displayed (**Allow Multiple Pages** = No), this is equivalent to the **Save** action.

### Save

This action saves the current Unified Interface Page.

## Predefined events

The following predefined events are associated with this hosted control type.

### ActiveClosed

Occurs when the active hosted control is closed using the [CloseActive](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/unified-service-desk/crm-page-hosted-control#CloseActive) action.  

| Parameter | Description                                                          |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| url       | The URL that was displayed in the hosted control when it was closed. |

## DataReady

Occurs as soon as the related information for an entity record is loaded in the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] context. This event occurs before the **PageReadyFor** event. If the **Pre-Fetch Data** option is selected for the control instance then this event occurs as soon as the entity data is fetched in a separate parallel call to the server and will not wait for the full page to finish loading. The entity data is pre-fetched and the **DataReady** event is fired for inline navigations as well.

## RefreshRequested

Occurs when refresh is requested on the current page. Refresh can be requested either by pressing the F5 key or calling the Refresh action by the application.

| Parameter | Description                                   |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| url       | The URL displayed when refresh was requested. |

## Saved

Occurs after a record in the Dynamics 365 page is saved.

| Parameter | Description                                  |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------|
| newId     | The ID assigned to the newly created record. |

## NavigationRequested

Occurs when the navigation happens within Unified Interface apps

| Parameter | Description                       |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| url       | The URL of the page navigated to. |

## PageReady

Occurs when the page has finished loading. On a Unified Interface Page type of hosted control, this event occurs after the data has been saved to the replacement parameter list.

| Parameter | Description                                    |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------|
| url       | The URL of the page that has finished loading. |
