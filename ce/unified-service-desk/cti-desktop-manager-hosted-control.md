# CTI Desktop Manager (Hosted Control)
Use the **CTI Desktop Manager** hosted control type to plug in a computer telephony integration (CTI) adapter into [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] to handle screen popping, call routing, softphone control, and other CTI functionalities.  

<a name="Create"></a>   
## Create a CTI Desktop Manager hosted control  
 For information about creating a CTI Desktop Manager and configuring the corresponding hosted control, see [Create a CTI Desktop Manager](../unified-service-desk/create-cti-desktop-manager.md).  

<a name="Actions"></a>   
## Predefined UII actions  
 These are the predefined actions for this hosted control type.  

<a name="Close"></a>   
### Close  
 This action is used to close the hosted control. Unlike the **CloseActive** action, if this tab (hosted control) is displaying more than one page, it will close all the pages displayed in the tab in your agent application.  

### CloseAndPrompt  
 This action closes the hosted control, but prompts the user to save or abandon the changes before closing.  

### DisableToolbarButton  
 This action disables the specified toolbar button on the toolbar in your agent application.  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
||Name of the toolbar button to disable.|  

### EnableToolbarButton  
 This action enables the specified toolbar button on the toolbar in your agent application.  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
||Name of the toolbar button to enable.|  

### Find  
 Navigate to the quick find list view of the specified entity.  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
||The data parameter should specify the entity logical name of the quick find list view to display. There are some special case values:<br /><br /> -   Use **case** or **incident** to display the quick find list view for cases.<br />-   Use **advfind** to display the advanced find view.<br />-   Use **activities** or **activity** to display the quick find list view for activities.|  

### FireEvent  
 Fires a user-defined event from this hosted control.  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|name|Name of the user-defined event.|  

 All subsequent name=value pairs become the parameters to the event. For more information about creating a user-defined event, see [Create a user-defined event](../unified-service-desk/create-user-defined-event.md).  

### GoBack  
 This action is equivalent to clicking the back button on the browser instance.  

### GoForward  
 This action is equivalent to clicking the forward button on the browser instance.  

### GoHome  
 This action goes to the initial URL specified for this browser instance.  

### LoadArea  
 This action loads a specific area from [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. This is equivalent to selecting an area in the navigation pane (such as Sales, Service, and Marketing). The only parameter is the name of the area to click. For example: **areaService**.  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|frame|The name of the frame to affect. If no name is specified, it will automatically target the first frame found on the page.|  

<a name="MoveToPanel"></a>

 This action is used to move hosted controls between panels at runtime.  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|app|Name of the hosted control to be moved.|  
|panel|Target panel for the hosted control.|  

### Navigate

| HideNavigationBar |                                                                                                                                                          If this parameter is supplied and **True**, the form will be displayed without loading the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] navigation bar.                                                                                                                                                          |
|       Frame       |                                                                                                                                                                          When frames exist on the page, this parameter would specify the name of the frame to navigate, rather than navigating the main window.                                                                                                                                                                          |
|     postdata      |                Data that is sent to the server as part of an HTTPPOST transaction. A POST transaction is typically used to send data gathered by an HTML page. In [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)], this data can be received from any event triggered using "<http://event/?>". Example: `[[postdata]+]`<br /><br /> Alternatively, the data can be passed as an encoded string with its header type in the intended format.                 |
|      header       | A string value that contains additional HTTP headers to send to the server. When the `postdata` parameter is used in the `Navigate` action, you should also specify an appropriate value for the `header` parameter. Example: `Content-Type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded`<br /><br /> If a [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]POST event triggers the `Navigate` action, the default value of this parameter should be `header=[[header]+]` |

### New_CRM_Page  
 Creates a page for creating a new [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] record of the entity specified, and treats the page as a popup from the specified hosted control. The window navigation rules are evaluated to determine the location where the page to create the entity record is displayed.  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|LogicalName|The logical name of the entity for creating a new instance.|  

> [!NOTE]
>  The rest of the parameters should consist of name=value pairs. These are the additional pre-populated values in the form for creating a new record for the specified entity. For more information about using this action, see step 4 in [Walkthrough 7: Configure agent scripting in your agent application](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough-configure-agent-scripting-agent-application.md).  

### Open_CRM_Page  
 Opens an existing instance of the entity specified and identified by the ID, and treats the page as a popup from the specified hosted control. The window navigation rules are evaluated to determine the location where the popup should be displayed.  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|LogicalName|The logical name of the entity to open.|  
|id|The ID of the entity record to open.|  

### Popup  
 Pops up a URL from the hosted control and runs the window navigation rules against it for routing the popup to the appropriate location.  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|url|Routes a popup from this hosted control using this URL as if it were a popup requested from the displayed control.|  
|frame|The frame from which this popup originated.|  

<a name="RealignWindow"></a>   
### RealignWindow  
[!INCLUDE[cc_RealignWindow_Action](../includes/cc-realignwindow-action.md)]

### ReRoute  
 This action takes the currently displayed URL, and sends it through the window navigation rules from the current hosted control as a popup.  

### RunScript  
 This action injects JavaScript into the main frame of the application. You should avoid using [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] client SDK calls with this action; instead, use the **RunXrmCommand** action.  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
||The data parameter is the JavaScript that will be injected into the form. **Note:**  The replacement parameters can be used in the script, and they will be replaced before the script is executed.|  

<a name="RunXrmCommand"></a>   
### RunXrmCommand  
 This action is used to inject [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] SDK JavaScript into the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] form.  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
||The data parameter is the JavaScript that will be injected into the form. **Note:**  The replacement parameters can be used in the script, and they will be replaced before the script is executed.|  

### Save  
 This action saves the current Dynamics 365 page.  

<a name="SaveAll"></a>   
### SaveAll  
 This action saves all forms in hosted control that allows multiple pages to be displayed (**Allow Multiple Pages** = Yes). If the hosted control allows only a single page to be displayed (**Allow Multiple Pages** = No), this is equivalent to the **Save** action.  

### SaveAndClose  
 This action saves the dirty data on the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] form, and closes the hosted control.  

<a name="SetSize"></a>   
### SetSize  
 This action explicitly sets the width and height of the hosted control. This is particularly useful when using "auto" in your panel layouts.  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|width|The width of the hosted control.|  
|height|The height of the hosted control.|  

### ToggleNavigation  
 This action collapses or expands the navigation pane on the left panel of the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] window. The navigation must contain a navigation panel for this action to work.  

### ToggleRibbon  
 This action collapses or expands the ribbon. If you hide the ribbon in the **Navigate** action, it will not be displayed and this action does not work. This action will work only when the ribbon was initially loaded.  

### WaitForComplete  
 This action can be used to block the processing until the URL finishes loading.  

> [!NOTE]
>  Some web pages, particularly [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] pages, have multiple frames. This action waits for only the main frame to complete.  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|Milliseconds|Optional parameter to indicate how long, in milliseconds, to wait to timeout.|  

<a name="Events"></a>   
## Predefined events  
 These are the predefined events for this hosted control type.  

### BrowserDocumentComplete  
 Occurs when the page has finished loading.  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|url|The URL of the page that has finished loading.|  

### FrameLoadComplete  
 Occurs any time when a frame has completed loading. This event can occur multiple times per page load when an iFrame or frame is used on the page. This event corresponds to the individual `BrowserDocumentComplete` events in code.  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|frame|The name of the frame that finished loading.|  
|url|The URL of the frame that finished loading.|  

### PopupRouted  
 Occurs after a popup has been routed by the system.  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|url|The URL of the popup that was routed.|
