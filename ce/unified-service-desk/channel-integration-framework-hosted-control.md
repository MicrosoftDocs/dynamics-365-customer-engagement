# Channel Integration Framework (Hosted Control)

Use the **Channel Integration Framework** type of hosted control to integrate your channel provider with to Unified Service Desk client application. You can create multiple Channel Integration Framework type of hosted control to host different channels. To learn more, see [Integrate channel using Channel Integration Framework](integrate-channel-provider-channel-integration-framework.md).

To create a Channel Integration Framework type of hosted control, see [Create a Channel Integration Framework hosted control](create-channel-integration-framework-hosted-control.md)

## Predefined UII actions

The following actions are supported for this type of hosted control.

### Close

This action is used to close the hosted control.

### FireEvent  

Fires a user-defined event from this hosted control.  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|name|Name of the user-defined event.|  

All subsequent name=value pairs become the parameters to the event. For more information about creating a user-defined event, see [Create a user-defined event](../unified-service-desk/create-user-defined-event.md).  

### MoveToPanel  

This action is used to move hosted controls between panels at runtime.  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|app|Name of the hosted control to be moved.|  
|panel|Target panel for the hosted control.| 

### Popup  

Pops up a URL from the hosted control and runs the window navigation rules against it for routing the popup to the appropriate location.  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|url|Routes a popup from this hosted control using this URL as if it were a popup requested from the displayed control.|  
|frame|The frame from which this popup originated.| 

### RunScript  

This action injects JavaScript into the main frame of the application.

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
||The data parameter is the JavaScript that will be injected into the form. **Note:**  The replacement parameters can be used in the script, and they will be replaced before the script is executed.|

### SetSize  
 
This action explicitly sets the width and height of the hosted control. This is particularly useful when using "auto" in your panel layouts.  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|width|The width of the hosted control.|  
|height|The height of the hosted control.| 

### SetUserCanClose  

Enables the user to close the hosted control by clicking the X icon at the top-right corner of the hosted control tab.  

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|UserCanClose|Set this to `true` to enable the user to close the hosted control. Otherwise, set false.|

### RaiseCifClientEvent

This action sends the data raised from the client-side event to the hosted control.

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|event| The client-side events from where you want to raise the data. |
|data| The data parameter takes eventData values.<br><br>Pass the data as a string that was received from the event by using replacement parameters. <br>`data = [[data]+]`.<br><br> Supported client-side events are as follows:<br> <ul> <li>[OnClickToAct](unified-interface-page-hosted-control.md#onclicktoact)</li> <li>[SendKbArticleEvent](unified-interface-page-hosted-control.md#onsendkbarticle)</li>  <li> [onpagenavigate event (CIF JavaScript API reference)](../channel-integration-framework/v1/develop/reference/events/onpagenavigate.md) </li></ul>|

### UpdateCifContext

This action sends the data from client to channel provider.

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
| corrId | The unique identifier should be the same as that of passed in the initial event from channel provider so that the **UpdateCifContext** gets back the result. |
| action | The parameter to accept or reject the promise object. It takes the value as `accept` or `reject`. If you pass `accept`, the API calls the success function, which will further execute the result parameter. if you pass `reject`, the API calls the error function.  |
| result | The data that you want to send from client to channel provider. |

## Predefined events

The following events are supported for this type of hosted control.

### CreateRecord

The event occurs when the corresponding Channel Integration Framework JavaScript API is called from the channel provider to create an entity. The data passed in the API is also passed to Unified Service Desk client application.

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|
| entity | The logical name of the entity. |
| data | String defining the attributes and values for the new entity record. |
| corrId | The unique identifier for the raised **CreateRecord** event. |

To learn more, see [createRecord (CIF JavaScript API Reference)](../channel-integration-framework/v1/develop/reference/microsoft-ciframework/createrecord.md)

### RetrieveRecord

The event occurs when the corresponding Channel Integration Framework JavaScript API is called from the channel provider to retrieve an entity. The data passed in the API is also passed to Unified Service Desk client application.

|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|
| entity | The entity logical name of the record you want to retrieve. |
| entityId | GUID of the entity record you want to retrieve. |
| corrId | The unique identifier for the raised **RetrieveRecord** event. |
| options | OData system query options, **$select** and **$expand**, to retrieve your data.<br> <ul> <li>Use the **$select** system query option to limit the properties returned by including a comma-separated list of property names. This is an important performance best practice. If properties aren’t specified using **$select**, all properties will be returned.</li> <li>Use the <b>$expand</b> system query option to control what data from related entities is returned. If you just include the name of the navigation property, you’ll receive all the properties for related records. You can limit the properties returned for related records using the **$select** system query option in parentheses after the navigation property name. Use this for both *single-valued* and *collection-valued* navigation properties.</li> </ul> <br>You specify the query options starting with `?`. You can also specify multiple query options by using `&` to separate the query options. For example:<br>`?$select=name&amp;$expand=primarycontactid($select=contactid,fullname)` |

To learn more, see [retrieveRecord (CIF JavaScript API Reference)](../channel-integration-framework/v1/develop/reference/microsoft-ciframework/retrieverecord.md)
