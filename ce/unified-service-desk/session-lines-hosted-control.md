# Session Lines (Hosted Control)
Use **Session Lines** type of hosted control to configure session overview information for sessions in your agent application. This hosted control reads the overview information that you configure in your agent application using **Session Lines** (**Settings** > **Unified Service Desk** > **Session Lines**), and an instance of this hosted control type must be available in your agent application for the session overview information to be displayed. For more information about session overview, see [Session overview](../unified-service-desk/session-management-unified-service-desk.md#SessionOverview) and [Define session overview information](../unified-service-desk/configure-session-information.md#SessionOverview).
