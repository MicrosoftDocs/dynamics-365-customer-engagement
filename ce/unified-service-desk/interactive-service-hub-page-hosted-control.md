# Interactive Service Hub Page (Hosted Control)
Use the **Interactive Service Hub Page** hosted control type to host  interactive service hub forms within [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] to integrate the capabilities of both the applications. Interactive Service Hub provides an intuitive interface and displays all the vital information related to customers in one place that lets customer support agents focus on things that require attention.  
  
 When an interactive service hub form  is loaded within the **Interactive Service Hub Page** hosted control, it will automatically scan the page for data, and automatically populate the replacement parameters in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]. The **Interactive Service Hub Page** hosted control type exposes a number of predefined UII actions and events that are unique to handling of interactive service hub pages including list manipulation actions, and a find action for displaying a quick search or advanced search page.  
  
 Unified Service Desk provides you with a sample package, **Interactive Service Hub**, which demonstrates how easily you can integrate the interactive service hub pages within Unified Service Desk. More information: [Unified Service sample applications](admin/sample-unified-service-desk-applications.md)  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can convert your existing **CRM Page** type of hosted controls to the **Interactive Service Hub Page** type to display [interactive experience](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=857057) forms used by the Interactive Service Hub application instead of the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] forms. However, there are some considerations in doing so. For more information, see [Blog: Support for Interaction Centric Forms within Unified Service Desk](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/usd/2016/05/24/support-for-interaction-centric-forms-within-unified-service-desk/)

## Create an Interactive Service Hub Page hosted control  
 While creating a new hosted control, the fields in the **New Hosted Control** screen vary based on the type of hosted control you want to create. This section provides information about the specific fields that are unique to the **Interactive Service Hub Page** hosted control type. For detailed information about creating a hosted control, see [Create or edit a hosted control](../unified-service-desk/create-edit-hosted-control.md).  
  
 ![Interactive Service Hub Page hosted control](../unified-service-desk/media/interactive-service-hub-page-hosted-control.png "Interactive Service Hub Page hosted control")  
  
 In the **New Hosted Control** screen:  
  
-   Under **Unified Service Desk** area, select **Interactive Service Hub Page** from the **USD Component Type** drop-down list.  
  
-   From the **Allow Multiple Pages** drop-down list, select **No** (default) to replace the interactive service hub page that is currently displayed, and update the browser history when [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] receives a navigate action call or a page is routed to the tab. Select **Yes** to automatically create a drop-down list when a second URL is called or a window navigation rule directs a page to the tab. This will allow the user to quickly search between the interactive service hub pages that are attached to this control. Also, when you select **Yes**, an additional field, **Maximum Browsers**, becomes available where you can specify the maximum number of pages to be displayed in the drop-down list.  
  
- **IE Process** is the default **Hosting Type** for this hosted control type, and you cannot select any other hosting type . For information about supported hosting methods in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)], see [Select a hosting method for hosted controls](../unified-service-desk/select-a-hosting-method-for-your-controls.md).  
  
-   Select the **Application is Global** check box to set the hosted control as global. Global hosted controls can be displayed outside of a customer session. Controls like the agentsâ€™ dashboard, wall or search are common uses for global hosted controls. Global hosted controls do not have session-specific state so when you change sessions, these same global hosted controls remain. If the check box is not selected, the hosted control becomes session based. Session-based controls exist in the context of the customer session. If the user changes to another session, all the session pages from the previous session are hidden.  
  
-   The **Display Group** field displays the panel where this hosted control will be displayed. **MainPanel** is the most common for this hosted control type. For information about various panels available in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)], see [Panels, panel types, and panel layouts in Unified Service Desk](../unified-service-desk/panels-panel-types-panel-layouts.md).  
  
-   Select **Yes** or **No** from the **Application is Dynamic** list to specify whether this is a dynamic hosted control. Dynamics hosted controls allow an agent to start or close a hosted control on demand, either by using the UI or programmatically through code. More information: [Dynamic Unified Service Desk hosted controls](../unified-service-desk/unified-service-desk-hosted-controls.md#Dynamic)  
  
     If you select **Yes**, the **User Can Close** check box becomes available. Select this check box to let users close this hosted control.  
  
 For information about other **General** fields, see [Create or edit a hosted control](../unified-service-desk/create-edit-hosted-control.md).  
  
<a name="actions"></a>   
## Predefined UII actions  
 These are the predefined actions for this hosted control type.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The **Interactive Service Hub Page** type of hosted control supports all the UII actions supported by the **Dynamics 365 Page** type of hosted control. However, some UII actions are not available when you first create and save an instance of the **Interactive Service Hub Page** type hosted control. Any subsequent update to the hosted control instance adds the missing UII actions.  
  
### AssociatedView  
 This action loads a specific associated view of the interactive service hub.  These views are typically accessed by clicking down arrow next to an entity record name in the nav bar, and selecting the associated entities.

<a name="Close"></a>   
### Close  
 This action is used to close the hosted control. Unlike the **CloseActive** action, if this tab (hosted control) is displaying more than one page, it will close all the pages displayed in the tab in your agent application.  
  
<a name="CloseActive"></a>   
### CloseActive  
 This action is used to close the active window within this hosted control. If the active window is the only window displayed in the hosted control, the hosted control itself will be closed. If you have chosen not to allow multiple pages for your hosted control (**Allow Multiple Pages** = No), this action is equivalent to the **Close** action.  
  
### CloseAndPrompt  
 This action prompts the user to save or abandon the changes before closing the hosted control.  
  
### Find  
 Navigate to the quick find list view of the specified entity.  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
||The data parameter should specify the entity logical name of the quick find list view to display. There are some special case values:<br /><br /> Use `case` or `incident` to display the quick find list view for cases.<br /><br /> Use `advfind` to display the advanced find view.<br /><br /> Use `activities` or `activity` to display the quick find list view for activities.|  
  
### FireEvent  
 Fires a user-defined event from this hosted control.  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|`name`|Name of the user-defined event.|  
  
 All subsequent name=value pairs become the parameters to the event. For more information about creating a user-defined event, see [Create a user-defined event](../unified-service-desk/create-user-defined-event.md).  
  
### GetSelectedCount  
 This action retrieves the number of items that are selected. Use the **GetSelectedIds** action to get the actual list of IDs for the entity.

|HideNavigationBar|If this parameter is supplied and **True**, the form will be displayed without loading the interactive service hub navigation bar.|  
|postdata|Data that is sent to the server as part of an HTTPPOST transaction. A POST transaction is typically used to send data gathered by an HTML page. In [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)], this data can be received from any event triggered using "http://event/?". Example: `[[postdata]+]`<br /><br /> Alternatively, the data can be passed as an encoded string with its header type in the intended format.|  
|header|A string value that contains additional HTTP headers to send to the server. When the `postdata` parameter is used in the `Navigate` action, you should also specify an appropriate value for the `header` parameter. Example: `Content-Type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded`<br /><br /> If a [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]POST event triggers the `Navigate` action, the default value of this parameter should be `header=[[header]+]`|  
  
### New_CRM_Page
