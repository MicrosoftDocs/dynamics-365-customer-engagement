# Use HAT automation activities in Unified Service Desk
The [!INCLUDE[pn_hosted_application_toolkit_hat](../includes/pn-hosted-application-toolkit-hat.md)] provides you with a bunch of automation activities that you can use to automate your hosted applications. To view the [!INCLUDE[pn_hat](../includes/pn-hat.md)] automation activities in [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio](../includes/pn-visual-studio.md)]:  
  
1.  Start [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio_short](../includes/pn-visual-studio-short.md)], and create a Workflow Activity Library or open a Workflow Activity Library project. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [How to: Create an Activity Library](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd489393\(v=vs.110\).aspx)  
  
2.  If **Toolbox** is not visible in the workspace area, from the **View** menu, choose **Toolbox** to display it.  
  
3.  In **Toolbox**, right-click and select **Choose Items**.

4.  In the **Choose Toolbox Items** dialog box, on the **System.Activities Components** tab, click **Browse** to locate and select the Microsoft.UII.HostedApplicationToolkit.Activity.dll file. The file is available in the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client installation directory (typically, C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics CRM USD\USD) or in the *<UII_SDK_Extracted_Folder>*\UII\Bin folder.  
  
5.  After you select the Microsoft.UII.HostedApplicationToolkit.Activity.dll file, the [!INCLUDE[pn_hat](../includes/pn-hat.md)] automation activities appear selected in the **Choose Toolbox Items** dialog box. Choose **OK** to display them in **Toolbox**.
