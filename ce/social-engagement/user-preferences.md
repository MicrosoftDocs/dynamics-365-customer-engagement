# Set your preferences for the user interface
When Administrators set up [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-social-engagement-long.md)], they define default values that apply to all users of the same solution. However, you can override the Administrator’s defaults to display the user interface according to your requirements. For your [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] profile, you can select the following:  
  
- Screen language  
  
- Default time frame in Analytics  
  
- Preferred color theme  
  
- Date and time format  
  
- Number format  

- Chart format
