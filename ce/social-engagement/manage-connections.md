# Manage connections in Social Engagement
[!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-social-engagement-long.md)] lets admins connect to and share social data with other applications. To work with social data in other applications, you can connect them on the **Connections** page in the [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] Settings area. The type of connection you create depends on the application you want to connect to.  
  
 ![Connections page in the Microsoft Social Engagement Settings area](media/settings-on-connections-page.png "Connections page in the Microsoft Social Engagement Settings area")  
  
-   Connect to [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_azure_event_hubs](../includes/pn-microsoft-azure-event-hubs.md)] and stream posts that match a data set as events from [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] to an event hub. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Stream data from Social Engagement to Microsoft Azure Event Hubs](stream-data-to-event-hubs.md)  
  
-   Connect to [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] to create new [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] records from posts found in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)]. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Link posts from Social Engagement to Dynamics 365](link-posts-to-dynamics-365.md)  
  
-   Manage a list of domains that allow applications to connect with and request data from your [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] solution. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Connect Social Engagement to other domains](connect-other-domains.md)  
  
    -   To display [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] widgets in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)], you need to connect [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] to [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)].  For [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] to be able to connect to [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)], its domain must be allowed in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)].

    -   If you want to import [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] data to [!include[](../includes/pn-customer-insights-full.md)], you can add [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] as a data source.
