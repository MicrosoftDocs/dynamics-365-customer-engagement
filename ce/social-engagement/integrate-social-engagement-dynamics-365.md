# Integrate Microsoft Social Engagement with Dynamics 365

In [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], you can get powerful social insights by connecting [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] to [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)]. [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] puts social media at the fingertips of your sales teams, customer service agents, and everyone across the organization. The easy-to-understand widgets provide insights and help you understand what your customers or prospects are saying about your products, brands, and services. Identify any issues or compliments that are mentioned about your products or services on social media. 

With [!INCLUDE[pn_social_insights](../includes/pn-social-insights.md)], you bring social media data directly into [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] dashboards and entity forms. As an administrator, you configure the connection to [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] and add the [!INCLUDE[pn_social_insights](../includes/pn-social-insights.md)] controls to the entity forms and system dashboards. You use the [!INCLUDE[pn_social_insights](../includes/pn-social-insights.md)] controls to specify what social data you want to see and in what form you want this data to be presented to you. When you set up the [!INCLUDE[pn_social_insights](../includes/pn-social-insights.md)] controls, you choose a search topic or search topic category and visuals. After you choose the search topic or category, you pick the visuals. It can be a graph or chart, or some other visual representation of data. You can find a lot of interesting, useful, and easy-to-follow information.

The [!INCLUDE[pn_social_insights](../includes/pn-social-insights.md)] widgets in your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] forms and dashboards provide convenient access to social data right where you work. At any time, you can click on any widget to be taken into [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] to [drill down and explore the data further](analyze-social-data-using-widgets.md).

## Add Social Engagement visuals to an entity form

To add Social Insights controls to an entity (record type) form, you have to [use the form editor](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn531185.aspx) provided in the Dynamics 365 Customization area. You can position the Social Insights control anywhere on the form and resize it, just like you would do with the iFrame controls. You can make the control bigger by increasing the number of rows and spanning the control over several columns. This is important if you want to make a graph or a chart in the control appear larger and be more readable. More information: Use the form editor.

1. Select **Settings** > **Customizations** > **Customize the System**.

2. In the navigation pane, under **Components**, expand **Entities**.

3. Expand the entity that you want to add the Social Insights control to. Select **Forms**.

4. In the grid view, select the entity’s **Main form**.

5. Select the **Insert** tab. At the top of the form, on the ribbon, select the **Social Insights** icon. In the setup dialog box, fill out the required fields, such as the unique name of the control and the label name.    
Choose to enable **Pass record object-type code and unique identifier as parameters**.

6. Select **OK**. The Social Insights control is now added to the entity form. You can resize the control or move the control to another location on the form.

7. Switch back to the **Home** tab. Select **Save** and then select **Publish** to publish the added customizations. The control called **Configure Social Insights** appears on all records based on this form. The search topics, search categories and visuals can be added to the control.  

## Add Social Engagement visuals to dashboards

You can add the Social Insights controls to the existing system dashboards or to a new dashboard. Let’s create a new dashboard and add the Social Insights control to it.

Shortly after the setup is finished and customizations are published, the charts and graphs with social data will appear on your dashboard.

2. In the Navigation Pane, under **Components**, select **Dashboards**.

## Set up search topics from within Dynamics 365  

Search topics are usually created by Administrators or Power Analysts directly in the settings of [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)]. However, to get up and running quickly, users with Administrator or Power Analyst user roles in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] can set up searches from within [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)].  
  
To have the full set of options for creating a search topic available, it’s a good idea to work directly in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)]. [Find out how to set up search topics in Social Engagement](set-up-searches.md).

## Reset Social Insights

This action deletes all existing data in Dynamics 365 for the search topics, search topic categories and visuals for Social Insights.

1. Select **Settings** > **Administration** > **Microsoft Social Engagement Configuration**.

2. On the **Microsoft Social Engagement Configuration** page, select **Reset Social Insights**. The **Reset Social Insights Confirmation** message box appears. Select **Confirm**, if you want to proceed, otherwise select **Cancel**.
