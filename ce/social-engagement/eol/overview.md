# Changes coming to Dynamics 365 Market Insights preview and Microsoft Social Engagement 

Due to the upcoming changes in product direction, 

- Dynamics 365 Market Insights Preview (MI) will deprecate the current application experience, including all social engagement capabilities, on July 1, 2019. 
- Starting October 1, 2019, Microsoft Social Engagement (MSE) will no longer support Twitter as a data source. 
- As addressed in prior communications, Microsoft Social Engagement will be available only until the expiration of your current subscription period or January 16, 2020, whichever is earlier. 

If you are seeking a social engagement solution, we recommend you look in [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps?search=social) or other marketplaces. 

[Dynamics 365 Market Insights Preview](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/market-insights/) offers a new experience that provides email alerts containing news and insights based on US web data. This application will evolve to help business professionals gain aggregated insights based on their audiences’ web activities such as search, browse and other signals. More information about roadmap capabilities will be available in October 2019 release notes, expected to be shared in June 2019.
