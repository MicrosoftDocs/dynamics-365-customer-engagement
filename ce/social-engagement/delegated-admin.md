# Enable a partner as a delegated admin
[!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-social-engagement-long.md)] puts powerful social tools in the hands of your sales, marketing, and service teams—helping them to gain insight into how people feel about your business and to proactively connect on social media with customers, fans, and critics.  
  
## For system admins  
As an admin for your organization, you can create or edit users, manage user licenses, set up search topics, and configure streams and social profiles, among other things. You can delegate this role to an authorized partner of [!INCLUDE[cc_Microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)]. When you authorize a partner to take on this role, the partner is referred to as a delegated admin.  
  
[!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Partners: Add or delete a delegated admin](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=616234)  
  
## For partners  
Your client must authorize you as a delegated administrator before you can start administering a client's account. To get client approval, you first send them an offer for delegated administration, which you can include with a trial invitation or purchase offer. You can also offer delegated administration to your client at a later time.

> [!NOTE]
>  Delegated admins will have their location set to the customer organization’s location. All maps in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-social-engagement-long.md)] will be shown from the customer organization’s defined location.
