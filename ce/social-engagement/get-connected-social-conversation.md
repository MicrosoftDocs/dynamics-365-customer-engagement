# Get connected to the social conversation by using Microsoft Social Engagement
There’s a good chance that your customers and stakeholders are talking about your company, your products, or your services somewhere on [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)], [!INCLUDE[tn_twitter](../includes/tn-twitter.md)], [!INCLUDE[tn_youtube](../includes/tn-youtube.md)], blogs—or anywhere on the web. With [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-social-engagement-long.md)], you can stay on top of what people are saying on social media about your products or services, so that you can respond quickly and address the issues effectively.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-social-engagement-long.md)] collects data from social media websites and presents it to you in easy-to-consume charts and graphs. You can use these charts and graphs to spot emerging trends in people’s comments, whether they’re positive, negative, or neutral. You can even drill down into the data and find out who’s mentioning your company, products, or services, where they posted the comment, and what they said. Armed with these insights, you can pinpoint what you’re doing right, and you can address potential issues before bigger problems arise.
