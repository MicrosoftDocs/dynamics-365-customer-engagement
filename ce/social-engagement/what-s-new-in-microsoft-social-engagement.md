# What&#39;s new in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)]

[!INCLUDE [mse-service-discontinuation](../includes/mse-service-discontinuation.md)]

Welcome to [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)]. Here's a list of features we added recently.

If you're new to [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)], see [Get started with Social Engagement](get-started.md).

For important, late-breaking information and a list of known issues, see the [Social Engagement Readme](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=393612).

## [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] 2019.04

### Compliance stream for Reddit

When a post or comment on Reddit is removed by the author, it's also removed from [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)].

## [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] 2019 Update 1.2

### Introducing new Reach prediction

Now you can get to the viral Tweets before others.
We've upgraded the Reach prediction to consider *who* is writing, *what* is being said, *how*, and *when*. Powered by the latest AI models from Social Engagement and methods from Microsoft Research, we can be the first to offer you high predictive performance. We strongly recommend to pay attention to content with high predicted Reach. Post with a high reach value is expected to get more retweets and thus will be seen by a much larger audience than an average tweet.

## [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] 2019 Update 1.1

### Discontinuation of Microsoft Social Engagement and transition to Dynamics 365 Market Insights

Dynamics 365 will focus on enabling businesses with artificial-intelligence-powered social and web insights rather than just social listening capabilities. Because of this, Microsoft Social Engagement will be discontinued. Combined capabilities and insights through social and web interactions powered by sources such as Bing search will be offered through [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Market Insights](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/ai/market-insights/). These social and web insights can help marketing, social media, and product teams understand what their customers and competitors are saying, seeking, and feeling.

## [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] 2018 Update 1.12

### Introducing new languages

This release introduces new languages for sentiment analysis, search rules, and the user interface.

The following languages are available in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] with Update 1.12:
- Indonesian (Bahasa)
- Czech
- Hungarian
- Hindi
- Korean

## [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] 2018 Update 1.11

### Announcing search rules for [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] business accounts and removal of [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] keyword search

As of December 10, 2018, we will introduce the ability to track your own [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] business accounts in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)]. You will be able to acquire posts and comments on your own [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] business accounts. To use this new functionality, the [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] Business Account needs to be linked to the respective Facebook page. Users in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] will need to authenticate or re-authenticate their Facebook Acquisition profile and set up [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] Account search rules.

[!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] is retiring keyword searches on December 10, 2018, and users will not be able to create new keyword search rules in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] for [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)]. Existing keyword search rules containing [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] as a source will continue to exist as is, and the data acquired for these rules is preserved, as long as the rules are not changed. However, no new [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] data will be acquired for these rules. If the user changes such a rule, [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] needs to be removed as a source to be able to save the edited search rule. In case you want to preserve your [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] data acquired to date, we recommend that you create a separate search rule with the changes and keep the rule with [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] data untouched.

You can find more information about the new functionality in the [Instagram Account search article](instagram-data-acquisition.md).


## [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] 2018 Update 1.10

### Introducing 5 languages for the user interface

We're introducing the translations for Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian, Slovenian, and Thai across the user interface in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)].
For more information about the available languages, see [International availability of Microsoft Dynamics 365](https://go.Microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=391086).

## [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] 2018 Update 1.9

### Home - your new start page

After signing in to [!INCLUDE [pn-social-engagement-short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)], the app presents a new start page called **Home**. It provides helpful resources and additional information in one spot. We'll be adding more features to the start page in future releases.

### Quick setup and initial insights in fresh solutions

[!INCLUDE [pn-social-engagement-short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] will guide users of newly created solutions to success. This quick setup is available to you on **Home** if your solution doesn't have any search topics set up yet.
You will create your first search topic and get initial insights within minutes.

## [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] 2018 Update 1.8

### Provide your feedback about [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)]

After signing in to [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)], you can select the smiley symbol and provide your feedback about the app and the service. We're looking forward to hearing your thoughts and continue to refine the product based on your feedback.

![Provide feedback in Social Engagement](media/feedback-prompt.png)

### Compliance stream for WordPress comments and Disqus

When a comment on WordPress is removed by the author, it's also removed from [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] databases.
If a user decides to delete their Disqus profile, all related comments and threads are deleted in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] too.

### Removal of interaction token for [!INCLUDE [tn-facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] user profiles

With this release, we're following [!INCLUDE [tn-facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)]'s Graph API v3.0 changes from August 1, 2018: [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] stops supporting engagement actions for [!INCLUDE [tn-facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] user profiles. Interaction tokens for [!INCLUDE [tn-facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] users were removed from [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] and you won’t be able to add them anymore.

Good to know: This change doesn't affect the way you [work with social profiles](manage-social-profiles.md) for [!INCLUDE [tn-facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] pages in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)]. You still need to create a **Facebook Acquisition** profile to allow data acquisition from [!INCLUDE [tn-facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] for [!INCLUDE [tn-facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] pages you administer.

## [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] 2018 Update 1.7

### New sign-in URL for [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)]

A new sign-in page is available to sign in directly to [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] without memorizing the solution URL or going through the Office 365 portal. Go to [https://social.dynamics.com/login](https://social.dynamics.com/login) to sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)].

### Removal of interaction functionality for [!INCLUDE [tn-facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] user profiles

With the release of [!INCLUDE [tn-facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)]'s Graph API v3.0 on August 1, 2018, [social profiles for Facebook](manage-social-profiles.md) users in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] can't interact with posts anymore. With this release, we're removing the option to create new [interaction tokens for Facebook user](manage-access-tokens.md) profiles. The logic for data acquisition doesn't change. You still need to create a **[!INCLUDE [tn-facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] Acquisition** profile to allow data acquisition from [!INCLUDE [tn-facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] for [!INCLUDE [tn-facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] pages you administer.

With the upcoming Update 1.8 in August, we'll also remove the interaction controls for [!INCLUDE [tn-facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] user profiles from the [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] user interface.

## [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] 2018 Update 1.6

### Change of permissions for newly invited users

When an administrator [assigns a Social Engagement license](assign-user-roles.md) to a user, this user will get Power Analyst and Responder permissions. This enables users to create search topics and engage in conversations with other authors. Administrators can [change the permissions](user-roles.md) at any time according to their business requirements.

### Reduction of retention time for Social Content to 15 months

On June 16, 2018, [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] will reduce the [retention time of Social Content](data-retention-social-engagement.md) to 15 months. This means that posts older than 15 months won’t be available in your [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] solution anymore. If you need to keep track of older data for reporting purposes, you can [export the data](analyze-social-data-using-widgets.md#export-data-from-widgets) before it gets deleted automatically.

### Disabling TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)]

The [Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms721627(v=vs.85).aspx#_security_transport_layer_security_protocol_gly) is most widely recognized as the protocol that provides secure HTTP (HTTPS) for connections between web browsers and web servers. The TLS 1.0 protocol version was defined in 1999. While no longer the default security protocol in use by modern operating systems, TLS 1.0 is still supported for backward compatibility. The same applies for TLS 1.1.

[!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] will remove the support of TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 in order to align with [!INCLUDE [cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] compliance requirements and security best practices.

#### What is the impact?

After [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] disables TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1, any connections to the service that rely on those versions will fail.

#### How to avoid interruptions in the user experience

We recommend switching to a browser supporting TLS 1.2.

All major releases of browsers (Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera) after April 2016 support TLS 1.2.

| Browser |  | Version| Remarks |
|---------|---|--------|---------|
|Microsoft Edge| equals or higher |12.10240| Compatible by [default](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/platform/status/tls12/?q=TLS%201.2)|
|Internet Explorer | | 11 | Enabled by default, Desktop & Mobile |
|Firefox | equals or higher | 27 | [Release notes](https://website-archive.mozilla.org/www.mozilla.org/firefox_releasenotes/firefox/27.0/releasenotes/?flang=es-MX), all operating systems  |
|Chrome | equals or higher| 29 | [Details](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=90392#c28), all operating systems |
|Safari | equals or higher | 7 | |
|Opera  | equals or higher | 12 | [Release notes](https://blogs.opera.com/security/2016/02/opera-12-and-opera-mail-security-update/) |
|Android OS Browser |equals or higher |  Android 5.0 (Lollipop) | Compatible by default |
|Mobile Safari | equals or higher | 5 for iOS 5 or higher| Compatible by default |

## [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] 2018 Update 1.5

### Attachments in private messages now show in the post list

[!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] now shows attached images and videos in private messages on Facebook and direct messages on Twitter directly in the post list. To see the attachments, open the post details of a direct message that contains attachments.

## [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] 2018 Update 1.4

### Refreshed visuals for Social Insights in Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement

The integration of Social Insights in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] forms and dashboards now comes with new and updated visuals. The existing charts and visuals now reflect the latest user interface of [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] and inherit several settings from [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)]. Due to this change, we have deprecated some widgets such as Analytics Summary. You can reconfigure to remove or replace such widgets.

The steps to [set up and configure Social Insights in Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement](integrate-social-engagement-dynamics-365.md) are now available in the help center.

### See which Facebook page a post is coming from and reply consistently

The post list in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] now shows on which [!INCLUDE[tn-facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] page each post and comment was posted. Engaging on your [!INCLUDE[tn-facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] page is now easier because the social profile matching this page will already be selected when you write a reply.

### Instagram account rules are no longer possible

Due to changes on the [!INCLUDE[tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] API, we are experiencing a downgrade on data acquisition for [!INCLUDE[tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)]. We are currently receiving lower volumes of [!INCLUDE[tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] posts for hashtag search rules, and no comments to [!INCLUDE[tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] posts at all. Additionally, we are not receiving posts or comments for [!INCLUDE[tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] account search rules. At this time, the search rules only return partial author information.

Existing search rules for [!INCLUDE[tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] accounts don't return results anymore. Keyword search rules with [!INCLUDE[tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] hashtags continue to work as expected.

## [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] 2018 Update 1.3

### Exclude option for author tags filter

The [author tags filter](understand-filters.md#author-tags) now lets you exclude specific author tags from your data set.

### Usability improvements for extended tweet length

Twitter extended its support for longer messages in November 2017. For most languages, the limits were the same. This update adds support for Korean, Thai, and Simplified Chinese.

### Introducing compliance stream for Twitter, Tumblr, and WordPress

[!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] now supports retroactive deletion of posts that were acquired and then deleted in the source. Posts from Twitter, Tumblr, and WordPress are now removed from [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] when the author removes them from the source.

### Service and product improvements

For a detailed list of improvements and bug fixes for the latest release, see our [blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/crm/tag/social-engagement-kb-articles/).

## [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] 2018 Update 1.2

### Let us know what you think about [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)]

With this update, we introduced a feedback dialog that is presented to a sample of users when they sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)]. We encourage everyone to provide feedback that will help us shape the service and align our priorities for future updates.

## [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] 2018 Update 1.1

### Improved accessibility across all interfaces

With this update, [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] is more accessible for all users. These changes include support for keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and overall improvements to the user experience.

New capabilities for all users:

- You can choose to represent the data from widgets in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] in a chart or a data table.
- You can choose to render the charts with a fill pattern or solid colors. When selecting the fill patterns, data on maps will be represented in different shapes and will not rely exclusively on color.
- You can navigate the maps in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] with a keyboard by selecting a tab to reach the first data point on a map.
- In activity maps, you can choose between a visual map and a data table. The map allows navigation by keyboard in cardinal directions.
- You will experience improved navigation for post lists and post details

To learn more, see our dedicated [documentation on accessibility for Microsoft Social Engagement](accessibility.md).

### Administrators now enabled to remove alert recipients

With an administrator configuration role in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)], you can now remove recipients from alerts that were configured by other users. You can search for a specific email address and then [remove the recipient from all alerts](email-alerts.md) that send email to that address. Additionally, you can export a list of alerts this recipient receives.

### Changes for author information from [!INCLUDE[tn-facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] pages

As of February 6, 2018, [!INCLUDE[tn-facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] updated its API to pull data for [!INCLUDE[tn-facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] pages. After that date, author information for [!INCLUDE[tn-facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] posts is only available for pages that have been added as a social profile to your [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] solution. The content of posts and comments, as well as enrichments such as sentiment, continue to be available for posts and comments without author information. We recommend you add page access tokens for every [!INCLUDE[tn-facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] page as a result of this change.
