# Create a Dynamics 365 record from a social post

Send a post found with [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-social-engagement-long.md)] to your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] instance to create a record. For example, you can automatically convert posts to cases for customer service, or to leads for your sales team. When you create a social activity, if the author of the post doesn’t have a social profile in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], the system creates a social profile and contact record, and then links the social profile with the contact record. When a record is created in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], you can see the details about this record in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)].  
Learn about the [prerequisites to establish a connection with Dynamics 365](connect-dynamics-365-social-engagement.md#prerequisites-to-establish-a-connection-with-dynamics-365) on how to configure your online and on-premises [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] instance to connect with [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)].

## Specify record details

You can define the information to show in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] record details when a record in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] is created from a social post. Depending on your selection, [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] fields shows the information about the connected instance and selected entity. To familiarize yourself with the social activity record type or the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] record creation and update rules feature, see [MSDN: SocialActivity entity messages and methods](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn689062.aspx), [CRM Help & Training: Set up rules to automatically create or update records in CRM](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=624394).  
  
Define the fields of a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] entity that you want to display in **Dynamics 365 Record Details** in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] when a record of the same entity is created from a post. Add the fields you want to see in the **Dynamics 365 Record Details** when you define the entity details in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)].    
[!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] lets you select the record type to create when linking a new post to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. Depending on the settings in **Entity Details**, you can see the current values of the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] record in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] when you load the record details for a post that was linked before.   

> [!NOTE]
> Only the custom entities in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] which are in relationship with the Social Activity entity are visible in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)]. For more information, see [TechNet: Create and edit entity relationships](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn531171.aspx).
  
### Define or edit fields for record details
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)], go to **Settings** > **Connections** > **Microsoft Dynamics 365**.  
  
2.  In the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connections** pane, select the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] instance that you want to define entity details for.  
  
3.  In the **Dynamics 365 Instance** pane, select the record type under **Record details**.  
  
4.  In the **Entity Details** pane, select the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] fields to show in the **Dynamics 365 Record Details** form for the selected entity. Or click **Add** ![Add button](media/add-icon.png "Add button") to add more fields.  
  
5.  Reorder the fields using the up arrow ![Reorder Dynamics 365 entity attributes up](media/arrow-up-icon.png "Reorder Dynamics 365 entity attributes up") or down arrow ![Reorder Dynamics 365 entity attributes down](media/arrow-down-icon.png "Reorder Dynamics 365 entity attributes down") or remove fields using the **Remove** button ![Delete button](media/delete-icon.png "Delete button").  
  
 ![Entity details](media/arrange-entity-details-for-linked-records.png "Entity details")  
  
  > [!IMPORTANT]
  >  You can't remove an entity if there are active automation rules using that entity. You will first need to deactivate or delete all automation rules using that entity. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Route posts using automation rules](automation-rules.md)  
  
6.  To apply your changes, in the **Dynamics 365 Instance** pane, click **Save** ![Save button](media/save-icon.png "Save button").  

## Convert a social engagement post to a social activity
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)], click **Posts** on any Analytics page to see the posts list.  
  
     --OR--  
  
     Go to **Microsoft Social Engagement** > **Social Center** to see your streams.  
  
2.  Go to the post you want to convert to a social activity record in [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)], and then click **Link to Dynamics 365** ![Link to Dynamics 365 button in Social Engagement](media/link-to-record-icon.png "Link to Dynamics 365 button in Social Engagement").  
  
 ![Link to Dynamics 365 button in Social Engagement](media/link-post-to-dynamics-365.png "Link to Dynamics 365 button in Social Engagement")  
  
3.  Select from the available instances, and then select the record type you want to create from the **Entity** drop-down list. The **Entity** drop-down list shows only those entities that are configured in the **Dynamics 365 Instance** panel in the **Dynamics 365 Record Details** section. If a single entity is configured with an instance, it will be selected by default.  
  
 ![Select instance and entity](media/create-record-in-dynamics-365.png "Select instance and entity")  
  
4.  Add any additional information, up to 250 characters, related to the record in **Notes**, and then click **Create**.  
  
     The post now displays a **Linked** button ![Link to Dynamics 365 button in Social Engagement](media/link-to-record-icon.png "Link to Dynamics 365 button in Social Engagement") along with the name of the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] instance it is linked to.  
  
 ![Linked button by a post in Social Engagement](media/post-linked-to-dynamics-365.png "Linked button by a post in Social Engagement")  
  
> [!TIP]
> -   To automatically create records in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] from social posts that match a specific data set, you can create automation rules. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Route posts using automation rules](automation-rules.md)  
> -   If the linked [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] instance has [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] system settings set to disabled, the link creation fails and shows this error message: "Dynamics 365 can’t receive social data from [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)]". Contact your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] administrator to review the Disable [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] system settings.

However, opening link details in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] will provide details about the social activiy only. Contact your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] administrator if this happens.

## Configure Dynamics 365 to automatically create records from linked posts

By default, [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] creates a Social Activity entity when a post is linked from Social Engagement. In [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], you can convert this entity to a different record type. To automate the process, you can set up Automatic Record Creation Rules in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] to automatically create records from incoming social activities.  
  
To learn more about the social activity record type or the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] record creation and update rules feature, see [MSDN: SocialActivity entity messages and methods](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn689062.aspx), [CRM Help & Training: Set up rules to automatically create or update records in CRM](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=624394).  
  
## Understand the data sent to Dynamics 365 when you create a social activity

When you create a social activity, [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] sends the social payload as a JSON object to the **Additional Parameters** field of a social activity. The payload can be used as channel properties that define conditions for rules, and for setting properties of the record you're creating or updating. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [CRM Help & Training: Set up rules to automatically create or update records in CRM](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=624394) The payload contains the most important fields required by [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] to consume tweets and [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] posts. These fields contain information about the post that was sent: author, content, URI to the original post, URI to the post in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)], and some additional post metadata. Based on the post’s source, the content of the payload may change.  
  
Social Activity in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] has an **Additional Parameters** field that receives the social payload as JSON from [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)].  
  
To learn more about how to set up channel properties in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] to work with Additional Parameters from [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)], see [CRM Help & Training: Set up rules to automatically create or update records in CRM](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=624394).

## View record details for a linked post in Social Engagement

If a post is linked to a social activity in [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)], you can open its associated record in **Dynamics 365 Record Details**.  

> [!NOTE]
> Only the custom entities in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] which are in relationship with the Social Activity entity are visible in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)]. For more information, see [TechNet: Create and edit entity relationships](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn531171.aspx).
  
### Open a Dynamics 365 record from within Social Engagement
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)], click **Posts** on the right side of any Analytics page to see the posts list.  
  
     --OR--  
  
     Go to **Microsoft Social Engagement** > **Social Center** to see your streams.  
  
2.  Select the post, and then click **Link to Dynamics 365** ![Link to Dynamics 365 button in Social Engagement](media/link-to-record-icon.png "Link to Dynamics 365 button in Social Engagement"). The **Dynamics 365 Record Details** dialog box shows all details for the associated Dynamics 365 record.  
  
 ![Dynamics 365 record details](media/view-dynamics-365-record-details.png "Dynamics 365 record details")  
  
## Open a linked record in Dynamics 365

1.  In [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)], click **Posts** on any Analytics page to see the posts list.  
  
     --OR--  
  
     Go to **Microsoft Social Engagement** > **Social Center** to see your streams.

3.  In the **Dynamics 365 Record Details**, click **Open Record** ![Open record](media/open-record-icon.png "Open record") to see the record in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)].  
  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] entities that are enabled for interactive experience open in the interactive service hub when you open a record on a social post that is linked to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] entities not enabled for interactive experience will continue open in the web client. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [CRM Help & Training: User's guide for the new interactive service hub](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=690167)  
  
 ![Open record in Dynamics 365 from Social Engagement](media/open-record-details-in-dynamics-365.png "Open record in Dynamics 365 from Social Engagement")  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If there are no rules, or no active rules, or the social activity doesn't meet the defined conditions, no target [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] record is created and the **Open Record** option  opens the social activity in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. When the target [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] record is created, the **Open Record** option  opens the target record.

## Remove a linked Dynamics 365 record from a post

You can remove a linked [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] record from a post. Note that removing a linked [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] record from a post also removes any attached notes. Consider removing a linked [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] record from a post when the link is no longer valid, is incorrect, or when you are considering creating a new entity record from the same post.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Removing a link does not affect the linked record in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], but only breaks the link between the [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] post and [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] record. Once removed there is no way to re-establish the link between the same [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] post and same [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] record.  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)], click **Posts** on the right side of any Analytics page to see the posts list.  
  
     --OR--  
  
     Go to **Microsoft Social Engagement** > **Social Center** to see your streams.  
  
2.  Select the post you want to open the associated record for, and then click **Link to Dynamics 365** ![Link to Dynamics 365 button in Social Engagement](media/link-to-record-icon.png "Link to Dynamics 365 button in Social Engagement").  
  
3.  In the **Dynamics 365 Record Details**, click **Remove**.
