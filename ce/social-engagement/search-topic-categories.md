# Group search topics into categories
You can use categories to structure and group search topics in  ways that make the most sense to you. Although categories have no impact on the posts that result from your search topics, they help greatly to organize your searches.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This topic is part of a walkthrough on how you can set up searches. More information: [Set up searches to listen to social media conversations](set-up-searches.md)  
  
## Required user roles  
 To create and manage a new category, you must have at least the Power Analyst user role in Analytics. To manage default categories that another user owns, you must have an Administrator user role in Analytics.  
  
 To assign a search topic to a category, or change the category for a search topic, you must either be the owner of the search topic or have an Administrator user role in Analytics. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Manage ownership of a search topic](create-delete-search-topic.md#manage_ownership)  
  
## Create a category  
 To see the category in Analytics, make sure that at least one search topic has this category assigned.  
  
1.  Go to **Search setup**.  
  
2.  In the **Categories** pane, click the **Add category** button ![Add button](media/add-icon.png "Add button").  
  
3.  Provide a name for the new category in the text box.  
  
4.  Click **Add category**.  
  
## Rename a category  
 To re-use existing categories and customize them for your needs, you can rename categories without impact on the data acquisition.  
  
1.  Go to **Search setup**.  
  
2.  In the **Categories** pane, select the category that you want to edit.  
  
3.  Click the **More actions** button ![More options](media/more-options-icon.png "More options"), and then click the **Rename** button ![Edit button](media/edit-icon.png "Edit button").  
  
4.  Update the name for the category in the text box.  
  
5.  Click **Rename**.  
  
## Delete a category  
 Before you delete a category, make sure that no search topics have this category assigned. If you own the search topics or are an Administrator, you can reassign the search topics to a different category before you delete it.  
  
 Deleting an empty category has no impact on the search results.  
  
1.  Go to **Search setup**.  
  
2.  In the **Categories** pane, select the category that you want to delete.  
  
3.  Click the **More actions** button ![More options](media/more-options-icon.png "More options"), and then click the **Delete** button ![Delete button](media/delete-icon.png "Delete button").  
  
4.  Confirm your deletion.
