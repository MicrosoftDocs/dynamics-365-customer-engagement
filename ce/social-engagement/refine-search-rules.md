# Refine your search rules to find relevant content
Analyze your results and optimize your search queries regularly to make sure you get the most relevant data. Your searches may return posts that are irrelevant in the context you are looking for. For example, if you want to search for the [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Windows_long](../includes/pn-ms-windows-long.md)] operating system and have “Windows” as your search keyword, you are likely to find results about house windows. In this case, consider adding “OS” or similar terms to make sure you’re searching for the operating system.

>  This topic is part of a walkthrough on how you can set up searches. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Set up searches to listen to social media conversations](set-up-searches.md)  
  
 
 Terms and sources change. New abbreviations may gain popularity, or news about your topic will be defined in a different way with different words. A recommended approach is to read carefully through new and important posts to identify emerging topics or changes in wording.

1. Go to **Search Setup**.  
  
2. In the list of search topics, find the topic you want to refine and select the list entry.  
  
3. Review your keywords, inclusions, and exclusions. Add synonyms, alternative spellings, typos, abbreviations, and the singular or plural forms of your terms.  
  
4. Click **Save** ![Save button](media/save-icon.png "Save button") to apply your edits and the updated search topic.  
  
   Using the updated rules, [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] starts searching for posts immediately after you save the changed search topic. You’ll see the first results from the updated rules after a few minutes, when you set the analysis time frame to **Today** in Analytics. To see the newly-acquired posts, open the **Posts** view.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  When you have updated a search topic, existing posts that matched the former configuration will remain in the database, but your analytics will adapt to the updated configuration. It may take a few hours to reflect the changes in the existing data.  
  
 In addition to refining your search rules, you can block the data acquisition for certain terms or domains by adding items to **Blocked Content**. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Manage the quality of your search results](search-results-quality.md)
