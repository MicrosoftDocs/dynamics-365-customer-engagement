# Find out what&#39;s covered by sources

[!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] provides a number of sources so you can keep track of conversations on your social media. [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] covers multiple sources where you can [track public posts](set-up-searches.md), and publish messages and replies. All sources can be [filtered](use-filters.md) in Analytics for an up-close look at your data. Find out what is covered by using the following available sources.

## Blogs

Create [keyword rules](add-rules-search-topic.md#addKeywordsRule) for full coverage for blog posts from Tumblr, broad coverage of blog posts from WordPress, and for blog posts from a third aggregated blog source, including a variety of blogs that range from blog aggregators like Blogger.com to small single-site blogs. If you want to update existing search topics to include the extended coverage of the blog's source, you can edit your existing keyword search rules.

## Custom sources

Get full coverage of public RSS or Atom feeds added in your custom source groups. Gather all posts from a previously created group of custom sources by creating a [custom source rule](add-rules-search-topic.md#customSourceRule). You can also create a keyword rule to filter by keywords.

## Disqus

Posts and comments published on Disqus are available for [keyword searches](add-rules-search-topic.md#addKeywordsRule).

## Facebook

Monitor posts and comments on [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] pages without age restriction or geographical restriction that are added to your [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] page rules. You can also gather private messages, including attachments, for [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] pages if you add a social profile and explicitly allow the acquisition of private messages.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] groups, [unpublished page posts](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/835452799843730) (formerly known as dark posts), ads, and status updates are not available for monitoring or engagement at this time. As of February 6, 2018, author information for Facebook posts is only available if you add a Facebook page profile for every page you own and keep their interaction tokens valid. 

To add a [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] page rule, see [Add a Facebook pages rule](add-rules-search-topic.md#addFacebookRule).

To add a private messages rule for [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] pages, see [Add a private messages rule](add-rules-search-topic.md#privateMessagesRule).

## Forums
[Keyword rules](add-rules-search-topic.md#addKeywordsRule) for forums are available to give you broad coverage of forum posts and comments.

## Instagram

After you add an [!INCLUDE[tn_instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] account to a social profile in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)], you need to allow the data acquisition for that profile. After you allow the data acquisition, you can configure search topics that contain [!INCLUDE[tn_instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] as a source. You can create a keyword search rule for #hashtags to receive posts from [!INCLUDE[tn_instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)]. 

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[tn_instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] is a listening source only. You will not be able to engage on [!INCLUDE[tn_instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] from within [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)]. #Hashtags are mandatory to search [!INCLUDE[tn_instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] accounts by using keyword rules. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Manage social profiles](manage-social-profiles.md)

## [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)]

Create [LinkedIn page rules](add-rules-search-topic.md#linkedin-page-rule) to gather posts and comments on your own [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Organization Pages, also known as [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Company Pages. After a page admin has added the social profile and shared it with other users, they can like posts and reply to posts and comments on behalf of the [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Organization Page from within [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)].

## News

Create [keyword rules](add-rules-search-topic.md#addKeywordsRule) for news posts from news publishers. This source can find posts in English, French, German, Spanish, and Portuguese. News posts are available for search topic rules.

## Reddit

Posts and comments published on Reddit are available for [keyword searches](add-rules-search-topic.md#addKeywordsRule).

## Twitter

Gain full coverage of public tweets on [!INCLUDE[tn_twitter](../includes/tn-twitter.md)] by creating a search topic with a [!INCLUDE[tn_twitter](../includes/tn-twitter.md)] profile rule or a keyword rule. You can also gather direct messages, including attachments, if you add a social profile and explicitly allow the acquisition of private messages.

To add a [!INCLUDE[tn_twitter](../includes/tn-twitter.md)] rule, see [Add a Twitter rule](add-rules-search-topic.md#addTwitterRule).

To add a private messages rule, see [Add a private messages rule](add-rules-search-topic.md#privateMessagesRule).

## Videos

Video posts and comments published on [!INCLUDE[tn_youtube](../includes/tn-youtube.md)] that mention a configured search term and match the configured search languages are available for [keyword searches](add-rules-search-topic.md#addKeywordsRule).

Video posts and comments on specific [!INCLUDE[tn_youtube](../includes/tn-youtube.md)] channels are available in [YouTube rules](add-rules-search-topic.md#add-a-includetnyoutubeincludestn-youtubemd-rule). Please keep in mind that videos often get a lot of comments, which can cause you to exceed your monthly post quota.
