# Understand widgets on the overview page

Start your analysis with an overview of the data that your solution has acquired so far. Find key widgets that provide information such as the volume of posts, their sources, sentiment, and where the posts are coming from.  
  
In [!INCLUDE[pn-social-engagement-short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)], go to **Analytics** > **Overview** to access the overview page.  

![Screenshot of the overview page in the Analytics area of Social Engagement](media/analytics-overview.png "Screenshot of the overview page in the Analytics area of Social Engagement")
  
> [!NOTE]
> **Overview** is the default page when you go to the Analytics area, or when you choose **[!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-social-engagement-long.md)]** on the navigation bar.  

## Authors

The normal view of this widget shows the top five authors and sources, based on the volume of posts and trend indicator. Select the **Full view** button ![Full view button](media/open-full-view-icon.png "Full view button") to expand the widget and find more details such as reach, source, and location for the 100 most-active authors and their posts.    
To add a filter for multiple authors at once, select the check boxes on the left side of the list for all authors that you want to include. Then select **INCLUDE** in the list header. To remove an author from the filter, select the check boxes on the left side of the list for all authors that you want to remove from the filter. Then select **EXCLUDE** in the list header.
> [!NOTE]
> Full view also has a **Delete** button ![Delete button](media/trashbin-icon.png "Delete button") you can use to [delete a selected author](manage-authors.md) and the author’s posts. You must have a **Power Analyst** or **Administrator** user role to delete an author.
>  When you delete an author, none of the author’s previous posts will be available in the solution’s database; they are permanently deleted. No new posts from this author will be acquired in the future.
