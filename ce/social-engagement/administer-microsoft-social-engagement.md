# Administer Microsoft Social Engagement
Setting up the solution for your users is crucial for the effective usage of [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-social-engagement-long.md)]. To learn more about the main tasks for administering your solution, review the topics listed here.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You need to have an Administrator configuration role in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] to perform the tasks below.  
  
## Configure global settings for other users  
**Outcome:** Prepare the system to get your users started quickly and efficiently.  

Set the default values for all users including the default search configuration and the look and feel of the application. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Manage Global settings](manage-global-settings.md)  
  
## Set up searches to gather relevant data  
**Outcome:** Get from no data (or bad data) to good data.  
  
Defining good search topics is one of the most important concepts when using [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)]. Learn how you gather relevant posts, refine your search topics, and make sure you stay within the post quota. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Set up searches to listen to social media conversations](set-up-searches.md)  
  
Optionally, you can extend the coverage of the data sources by adding RSS feeds as custom sources. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Create or delete custom sources](custom-sources.md)  
  
## Integrate Social Engagement with other applications  
**Outcome:** Build workflows between [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] and export data to other third-party applications using [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_azure_event_hubs](../includes/pn-microsoft-azure-event-hubs.md)].  
  
When establishing the first connection, make sure to add the target application's URL to the Allowed Domains settings page in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)]. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Connect Social Engagement to other domains](connect-other-domains.md)  
  
[!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-social-engagement-long.md)] lets admins connect to and share social data with other applications, such as [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_dyn_365](../includes/pn-ms-dyn-365.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Azure](../includes/pn-windows-azure.md)] services. To work with social data in other applications, you can connect them on the **Connections** page in the [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] **Settings** area. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Manage connections in Social Engagement](manage-connections.md)  
  
## Add social profiles to engage in conversations  
**Outcome:** Enable your team to answer and interact in the name of your organization.  
 
Set up social profiles to interact with other users on the social web and to engage with customers, fans, or critics. You can share these with other users, or use them to acquire data from specific sources. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Manage social profiles](manage-social-profiles.md)  
  
## Work with machine learning features  
**Outcome:** Let the algorithms adapt to you organization's use cases. Benefit from intelligence features to identify relevant posts and authors more efficient.  
  
Some tagging and sentiment capabilities in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] are based on algorithms that learn from your inputs.  
  
To reset and review your organization's sentiment model, see [Adaptive learning based on changes to organization’s sentiment values](adaptive-learning.md).  
  
To configure the automated tagging of posts, see [Work with tags](tags.md).  
  
## Manage licenses and users  
**Outcome:** Enable your team to access [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-social-engagement-long.md)] and work on sales, customer care, or marketing scenarios.  
  
Get to know how you can give users access to [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] and how you can add user licenses and post quota to your subscription. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Integrate Social Engagement with Office 365](manage-licenses.md)  
  
There are two types of user roles in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)]: Configuration roles and Interaction roles. Assign users of your solution the appropriate roles for analyzing data and engaging publicly on social media. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Understand user roles](user-roles.md)
