# Address customer service scenarios on social media with Social Engagement

Do you want to offer fast, powerful support to your customers on social channels? This overview suggests ways you and your team can use [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] to address your customers' service requests on social media. [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] lets you keep track of requests and adds intelligence on top of this tracking. You can answer customers directly in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] or link them to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] for further tracking.

## Prerequisites

- You (and any user you plan to work with) have a [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] license assigned.

- [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] is [set up](administer-microsoft-social-engagement.md).

- [Search topics are configured](set-up-searches.md) and data acquisition is up and running.

- You have the required [user roles and permissions](user-roles.md) assigned in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)].

## Social customer care scenario overview

The following steps describe an end-to-end configuration for social customer care. Review the steps and decide which are relevant for your customer care scenario.

1.  [Enable service reps to engage with customers via social media](#manage-social-profiles-to-participate-in-conversations) by adding and sharing social profiles and streams.

2. Before you start engaging with customers, you need to [create a search topic](set-up-searches.md) with rules that gather all posts that address your organization's social profiles. For example, if you added a Twitter or Facebook page profile, make sure you [allow the acquisition of private messages](manage-access-tokens.md#tokens-for-interactions-with-posts) and [create search rules](add-rules-search-topic.md) that gather private messages and all post types for the profile.

3. [Add tags, automatically and manually](#use-intelligence-to-boost-productivity), and learn how automated intention analysis can help triage incoming posts. Let [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] do some of your work for you.

4. [Save time on repetitive tasks](#create-support-cases-in-includepncrmshortestincludespn-crm-shortestmd-from-social-posts). Create new case records in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] directly from a post within [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)].

5. [Collaborate with your team](#establish-workflows-and-collaborate-with-other-users) and make sure they address the right customer issue with the intended priority.

> Some of these capabilities can be automated. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Route posts using automation rules](automation-rules.md)

## Manage social profiles to participate in conversations

 Learn how to add and share social profiles and streams in Social Center, how to keep them up and running, and how to enable users to post on behalf of your organization.

1. [Add a new social profile](manage-social-profiles.md).

2. [Share a social profile](manage-social-profiles.md#share-a-social-profile-with-other-users).

3. [Create](social-center.md#configure-a-stream) and [share a stream](social-center.md#share-a-stream).

4. [Keep social profiles up and running](social-profiles-health-state.md).

## Use intelligence to boost productivity

Let [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] work for you. Find out how you can add tags to important posts, automatically or manually, and learn how intention analysis can help triage incoming posts and how to automate this process.

- [Define a new tag](tags.md#add-custom-tags) so you can add it to posts.

- Let the system learn from the tags you added and [automate the tagging of posts](tags.md#promote-custom-tags-to-auto-tags).

- Get [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] to [find the intentions in posts](tags.md#how-intention-analysis-works) to enable quick triage of large number of posts. For example, you can route support requests to your service reps.  
To further increase efficiency, you can automate the routing of posts by using [automation rules](automation-rules.md).

## Create support cases in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] from social posts

Save time and minimize repetitive activities. [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] lets you create new records in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] directly from a post within [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)]. For example, you can create a case and assign it so the right service rep in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] so they review and solve the case efficiently.

1. Get an [overview](link-posts-to-dynamics-365.md) of the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] integration.

2. [Set up the connection](connect-dynamics-365-social-engagement.md) to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)].

3. [Set up record details](create-dynamics-365-record-from-social-post.md) for cases.

4. [Create a case from a post](create-dynamics-365-record-from-social-post.md#convert-a-social-engagement-post-to-a-social-activity) in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)].

## Establish workflows and collaborate with other users

Collaborate with your team and make sure they prioritize the right issues.

1. [Assign posts](work-with-posts.md#assign-a-post-to-other-users-in-analytics-and-social-center) to other users to distribute work across the team.

2. [Share streams](social-center.md#share-a-stream) with other users so they can work on posts in near&ndash;real time.

3. [Add labels](work-with-posts.md#add-a-label-to-a-post-in-analytics-or-social-center) to posts to route them to specific streams.
