# Publish and react to posts
Staying in touch with customers, prospects, and other stakeholders through social media channels is a key factor in business success. Take action on posts that you find with [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-social-engagement-long.md)]. Share, like, or comment on [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] posts, or retweet, like, or reply to [!INCLUDE[tn_twitter](../includes/tn-twitter.md)] posts to stay in touch with and engage with your audience. Start a conversation by writing new posts from within [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)].  
  
<a name="Prerequisites"></a>   
## Prerequisites  
 Before you start to engage with your audience, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:  
  
1.  You have an [Interaction user role of Responder or Manager](user-roles.md), which allows you to publicly post on social networks from [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)].
  
2.  You own at least one [social profile](manage-social-profiles.md) or have it shared with you for the social networks that you want to interact on.
  
3.  Social data is already available in your [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] solution. You can find it in the **Posts** area in **Analytics**, or through [streams](engage-on-social-networks.md)  in the **Social Center**. 
  
    > [!TIP]
    >  If you don’t own any social profiles, [!INCLUDE[tn_twitter](../includes/tn-twitter.md)] posts provide the option to use [Web Intents](https://dev.twitter.com/web/intents). You must sign in to [!INCLUDE[tn_twitter](../includes/tn-twitter.md)] to post with your profile.  
  
<a name="engageOverview"></a>   
## Engage on a post in Social Engagement  
[!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] lets you proactively engage on social media or react to social data that you gather. In no time, you can compose a post, answer questions, share information, or socialize with your audience on social networks.  
  
The following table shows what [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] lets you do depending on where you want to interact.

> [!NOTE]
>  If you apply several actions on posts in the same post list, the system  queues all planned actions so that you can seamlessly proceed with your work. If a queued action fails, you’ll get notified directly in the application. If you switch to a different area in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] while some actions are still in the queue, the application warns you before interrupting the actions.  
>   
>  Posts that you send from [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] are not picked up automatically by your search topics. Create a [!INCLUDE[tn_twitter](../includes/tn-twitter.md)] rule to [track all tweets](add-rules-search-topic.md) from a specific author (in this case your social profile), or a [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] page rule to [capture all posts](add-rules-search-topic.md) from a specific [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] page.
