# Sign in to Social Engagement
To sign in to Social Engagement, you'll need to be assigned a user license. Your organization's Office 365 administrator assigns user licenses when setting up Social Engagement. For more information about assigning licenses to users, see [Manage user licenses](manage-licenses.md).

3.  From the [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] app launcher, click **Social Engagement**.
