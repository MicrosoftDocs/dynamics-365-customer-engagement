# Explore more options with your data set
Your search topics usually gather more data than you want to analyze at a given moment. When narrowing the data for the most relevant posts in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-social-engagement-long.md)], data sets are often key to an accurate and detailed analysis. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Set a baseline for your analysis with a data set](use-filters.md#data_set)  
  
 In some areas of [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)], you can copy a given data set over to a different area to save time. For example, you can have a stream in **Social Center** that shows an overwhelming amount of posts. You decide to analyze those posts in the **Analytics** area to drill down into the information using the filtering functionality. You find a set of important posts and choose to get informed of any similar new posts. By passing your data set over to the **Message Center**, you can create an alert with a single click.  
  
 The following table shows the areas in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] between which you can pass a data set.  
  
|Area|Create stream|View/Open in Analytics|Create alert|Create activity map|Create automation rule|  
|----------|-------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|  
|Social Center|--|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|  
|Analytics|No|--|Yes|Yes|Yes|  
|Activity Maps|No|Yes|No|--|No|  
|Automation rules|No|Yes|No|No|--|
