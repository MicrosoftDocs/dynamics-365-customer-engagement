# Work with Office 365 Groups in Social Engagement

[!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] Groups are shared workspaces where group members can collaborate and quickly get stuff done. To collaborate with a group of users in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-social-engagement-long.md)] you can share social profiles and streams, or assign posts to groups. You can create and manage groups in [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Outlook_Short](../includes/pn-ms-outlook-short.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-office-365-admin-center.md)]. Groups are automatically synced to [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)], but you cannot change them from within [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)].  
  
## Work with groups  
  
> [!TIP]
>  Groups may take a few minutes to sync when you create or edit them before you can work with them in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)]. When you add or remove users from an [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] Group, any posts assigned to the group and streams or social profiles shared with the group will become automatically available to the newly-added users, and no longer available to the removed users.
