# Set up searches to listen to social media conversations
Listen to conversations on social media around your brand, business, products, and competitors. The first step to successfully engaging with your customers and others on social media is setting up your search topics to be sure you’re capturing the right conversations. After you’ve captured these conversations, you can fine-tune your searches, analyze your data, and drill into the information that matters most.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  At least one active search topic is required to acquire social data. If you don’t see any data in Analytics, make sure your search topics are correctly configured. It will take some time before you see the first posts in Analytics after you create a new search topic. Remember to set the time frame in Analytics to **Today**, so you'll be able to see results from a newly-created search topic.

## Access search topics  
 To access the search topics in your organization’s solution, go to **Search Setup**.  
  
> [!TIP]
>  You can filter search topics and category names in the search box in Search Setup, or filter on languages and sources when you create a search topic, and in custom sources. You can also sort search topics alphabetically, by the number of posts, or by category.  
  
## Available languages for search rules  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-social-engagement-long.md)] offers a broad set of languages where search rules can look for matching posts. However, sentiment analysis is available for a subset of the search languages. For more details about the language coverage, download and review the [Translation Guide](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=391086).
