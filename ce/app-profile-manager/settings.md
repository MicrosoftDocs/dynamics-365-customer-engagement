# Manage settings

## Introduction

The Settings option under Customer Service workspace or Omnichannel Administration lets you manage the settings required to run or use Customer Service workspace or Omnichannel for Customer Service.

### Customer Service workspace

When you select settings from Customer Service workspace (preview) in the left pane, the **Queues** page is opened on a new tab. In Service Management, you can manage cases, accounts, service schedules, and other settings.

### Omnichannel for Customer Service

When you select settings from Omnichannel Administration in the left pane, the **Entity records** page is opened on a new tab. In the Omnichannel Administration app, you can configure work streams, channels, queues, and other settings.
