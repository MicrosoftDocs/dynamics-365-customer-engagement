# Experience for accessing templates and productivity tools

The app profile manager is an easy-to-use interface that helps you get started with what you can do on the page.

The options to access and manage the following entities are available on the left pane of the app profile manager:

- Settings
- Channel provider
- Templates
  - Session templates
  - Application tabs
  - Notifications
- Productivity
  - Smart assist
  - Agent scripts
- Macros

All these options are available in Unified Interface. Select any of the option to open it in  a new tab.

> ![Navigation menu.](media/app-profile-navigation-items.png "App profiles home page")

Irrespective of the path from where you navigate to any of the components, such as session templates or application tab templates, the templates that you've defined for Customer Service workspace and Omnichannel for Customer Service will be displayed because they're stored in a common library.

## Settings

Select **Settings** in **Customer Service workspace** to open the **Queues** page on a new tab.

Select **Settings** in **Omnichannel Administration** to open the **Entity Records** page on a new tab.

### Channel provider

The **Channel provider** option in **Customer Service workspace** or **Omnichannel Administration** opens the channels view on a new tab where you can configure a new channel or update the settings of the existing providers.

### Templates

The following template types can be accessed:

- **Session templates:** Opens the Session templates page where the out-of-the-box templates and custom templates created by you're listed.
- **Application tabs:** Opens the application tab templates page to create and manage application tab templates.
- **Notifications:** Opens the notifications templates page to manage the templates.

### Productivity

You can access the following options in the **Productivity** area:

- **Smart assist:** Opens the settings for AI-based suggestions for similar cases, knowledge articles, and ongoing conversations.
- **Agent scripts:** Opens the agent scripts page for you to create and manage scripts.
- **Macros:** Opens the macros page for you to create and manage macros.

## Upgrade experience for existing Omnichannel for Customer Service

When you upgrade your existing environments, the settings for templates, productivity tools, and channels configuration in the out-of-the-box app profile will reflect the existing state of your environment. For example, if productivity pane is enabled and smart assist is configured, the settings will be retained in the out-of-the-box app profile.
