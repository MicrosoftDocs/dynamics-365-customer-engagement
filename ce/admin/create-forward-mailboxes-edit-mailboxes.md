# Create forward mailboxes or edit mailboxes

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

By default, when users and queues are created in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)], their respective mailbox records are also created. These mailbox records contain information that is specific to an individual mailbox on the email server, like email address, mailbox credentials, and email synchronization method. To process email messages using server-side synchronization for users and queues, their respective mailbox records should be associated to an email server profile record in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].  

 If your organization wants to configure server-side synchronization using a forward mailbox, you can create a new forward mailbox record. A forward mailbox is used as a collection box for email messages that are transferred from each user’s mailbox on the email system by a server-side rule. The forward mailbox must be dedicated to server-side synchronization, and must not be used as a working mailbox by an individual user. This can be used to process email messages for users and queues whose mailboxes have **Incoming Email Synchronization Method** set to **Forward Mailbox**. You must associate the forward mailbox record to an email server profile record to process email using server-side synchronization. [Forward mailbox vs. individual mailboxes](../admin/forward-mailbox-vs-individual-mailboxes.md).  

> [!TIP]
>  You can use an [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] shared mailbox when you create a queue in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] and not consume an [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] license for a forwarding email account.
