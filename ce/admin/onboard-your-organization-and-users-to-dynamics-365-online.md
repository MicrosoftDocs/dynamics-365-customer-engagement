### Choose your support  
 Microsoft provides flexible, industry-leading support, services, and resources that enable users to quickly address technical issues and maximize return on your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] investment. Choose a plan that best meets your business requirements.

<a name="Communicate"></a>   
### Set up points of contacts for communications  
 Microsoft regularly maintains and updates [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] to ensure security, performance, and availability, and to provide new features and functionality. From time to time, Microsoft also responds to service incidents. For each of these activities, the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] admin for your organization receives email notifications. You have control over who should receive these email communications.

<a name="Subscription"></a>   
### Manage subscriptions, licenses, and user accounts  
 As a [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Online_Services](../includes/pn-ms-online-services.md)] administrator, you manage the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] subscription, including billing and payments, user licenses, accounts and registration. You do these tasks in the [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] admin center. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Manage subscriptions, licenses, and user accounts](manage-subscriptions-licenses-user-accounts.md)  
  
<a name="POR"></a>   

### Add a Partner of Record to share account details with your partner  
 Many customers choose to work with a designated Microsoft partner to set up, customize, deploy, and administer their [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] instance(s). If you have a partner assisting you, this process can be facilitated by selecting a designated Partner of Record (POR) inside the [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] Portal. This enables the sharing of select details, such as contact and user information with your POR. Sharing this information will allow your partner to more quickly access information about your account, create support requests on your behalf, and work with Microsoft to assist with your accounts.

<a name="Plan"></a>   
### Plan your deployment  
 Many decisions you make at the beginning and throughout the deployment process can have downstream effects and impact other phases of the plan. Developing a plan to deploy [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] is important in determining the actions to take from inception to go live. The amount of resources involved in planning depends on the size and scope of the project. Large organizations may need a deployment team, while a small organization may assign these functions to a key person.  
  
 Often times an organization will employ an independent software vendor (ISV), value-added reseller, or partner to help implement and maintain a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] deployment. Partners bring experience, best practices, and industry expertise that will be valuable in the planning and deployment process.

The gamification solution relies on fun, engaging activities that drive collaboration and competition to increase performance and participation. The solution uniquely encourages broader participation by getting more employees in the game through drafting teams. Organizations typically see increased productivity, engagement, and performance as well as user adoption of business applications.

### Empower your users with rich dashboards and reports  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] is all about gaining insights from data. Dashboards collect a user’s most important data in one place in easy-to-read charts and lists. Users can select the dashboard that’s right for their role, or as the administrator or system customizer, you can modify the system dashboards or create new ones. Users can also create their own dashboards.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] also comes with many built-in reports that your organization can use as is or modify. Or create new reports. When you need to provide deeper insights, take advantage of Power BI.
