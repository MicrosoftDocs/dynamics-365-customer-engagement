# System Settings dialog box - Goals tab

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

Set the duration and frequency of the automatic rollup of goals. These settings only affect the automatic handling of all goals set in [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)]. You can always perform a manual rollup for any goal at any time.  
  
## Open the System Settings dialog box (if it isnâ€™t already open)  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_permissions_system_admin_and_customizer](../includes/proc-permissions-system-admin-and-customizer.md)]  
  
    Check your security role  
  
   - [!INCLUDE[proc_follow_steps_in_link](../includes/proc-follow-steps-in-link.md)]  
  
   - [!INCLUDE[proc_dont_have_correct_permissions](../includes/proc-dont-have-correct-permissions.md)]  
  
2. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_administration](../includes/proc-settings-administration.md)]  
  
3. Click the **System Settings** > **Goals** tab.

|     Days after the goal end date when the rollup will stop     | Default: 30 days. Set the number of days after the ending date of a goal for [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] to stop including a goal in a rollup. |
|                  Roll-up recurrence frequency                  |                                                      Default: 24 hours. Set the number of hours between each goal rollup.                                                      |
