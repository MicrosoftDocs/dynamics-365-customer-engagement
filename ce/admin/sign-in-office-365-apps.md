# Sign in to Customer Engagement and Office 365 apps

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

There are multiple ways to sign in and access your Dynamics and [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] apps. You can sign in by using the [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-office-365-admin-center.md)], or sign in directly. For [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_8_2_0_online](../includes/pn-crm-8-2-0-online.md)], we're introducing the [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] home page which you can also sign in to directly.  
  
> [!TIP]
>  Admins: Be sure to share this information with your end users.  
> 
>  You can troubleshoot issues with signing in to [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] using the Support and Recovery Assistant for Office 365. For more information, see the blog [New diagnostic scenario for web sign-in](https://community.dynamics.com/crm/b/dynamicscrmsupportblog/archive/2016/11/15/new-diagnostic-scenario-for-web-sign-in).

## Signing in to https://portal.office.com  
 For admins and end users, when you sign in to https://portal.office.com, you will go to the [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] Welcome page. The tiles that appear on the Welcome page depend on what licenses you have. For example, if you have licenses for [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)], you'll see tiles for [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Office](../includes/pn-ms-office.md)] apps like [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Word_short](../includes/pn-ms-word-short.md)], [!INCLUDE[pn_onedrive](../includes/pn-onedrive.md)], and [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)], as well as a tile for [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)].

Click this tile to get to the [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-office-365-admin-center.md)], where you can see your service health, manage users, manage licenses, and more for all the online services associated with your account.
