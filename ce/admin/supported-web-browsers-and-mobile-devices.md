Users can access the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] Web application with the most recent versions of these popular browsers:  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_Internet_Explorer](../includes/pn-internet-explorer.md)]   
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_edge](../includes/pn-microsoft-edge.md)]  
  
- [!INCLUDE[tn_Firefox](../includes/tn-firefox.md)]   

- [!INCLUDE[tn_chrome](../includes/tn-chrome.md)]
  
- [!INCLUDE[tn_Safari](../includes/tn-safari.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> - Users who try to view [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] on an unsupported browser may be redirected to a mobile experience. 
>   - For [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-9-0-0-online](../includes/pn-crm-9-0-0-online.md)] and later, users are redirected to the Unified Interface experience. For more information see [Unified Interface Overview](about-unified-interface.md). 
>   - For versions earlier than [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-9-0-0-online](../includes/pn-crm-9-0-0-online.md)], users are redirected to [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-for-phones-express](../includes/pn-crm-for-phones-express.md)]. This is a basic service that has limited functionality, and isnâ€™t intended to serve as a substitute for the full feature set of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]. We recommend that users choose a supported browser or a [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] app specific to the device. 
> -  If you have added content to forms or dashboards in an iFrame, you might have implemented security restrictions around certain actions in that content, such as external links. Keep in mind that in [!INCLUDE[tn_Firefox](../includes/tn-firefox.md)], this security restriction code will likely be unsupported.

## Known issues when you run Microsoft Dynamics 365 with certain web browsers  
 This section describes the known issues when you run [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] in a web browser.  
  
### Limited copy and paste support in Firefox and Chrome  
 Copy and paste functionality by using the clipboard is not yet fully supported on the [!INCLUDE[tn_Firefox](../includes/tn-firefox.md)] and [!INCLUDE[tn_chrome](../includes/tn-chrome.md)] web browsers; the **Copy a Link** button at the top of the page may not function as expected.  
  
### You receive an error opening an Excel worksheet when you use Safari  
 If you export an [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Excel_Full](../includes/pn-ms-excel-full.md)] worksheet as a Dynamic Worksheet while using [!INCLUDE[tn_Safari](../includes/tn-safari.md)], you may receive an error when trying to open the file. To remedy this, right-click the file, click **Get Info**, and, under **Open With**, select [!INCLUDE[pn_Excel_short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)].
