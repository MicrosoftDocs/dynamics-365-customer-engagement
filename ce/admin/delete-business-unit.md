# Delete a business unit

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

You can delete a business unit to completely remove it from [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Before deleting a business unit, be sure to consider the following:  
>   
> -   Deleting a business unit is irreversible.  
> -   The records owned by the business unit are deleted at the same time you delete the business unit.  
> -   You can’t delete a business unit until you delete any associated users, teams, and child business units.  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_security](../includes/proc-settings-security.md)]  
  
2.  Choose **Business Units**.  
  
3.  Click to select the business unit that you want to delete.  
  
4.  On the Actions toolbar, choose **More Actions** > **Disable**.  
  
5.  In the **Confirm Deactivation** dialog box, choose **Deactivate**.  
  
6.  With the entry for the business unit you’re deleting still selected, on the Actions toolbar, choose the **Delete** icon ![Delete button](../admin/media/delete.gif "Delete button").  
  
7.  In the **Confirm Deletion** dialog box, choose **Delete**.
