# Administer model-driven apps in Dynamics 365

Effective October 2019, the *Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement* SKU/license plan is no longer available for "online" customers. More information: [Dynamics 365 Licensing Update](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/licensing/update)

With this change for "online" customers, we are no longer using the term "Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps" to refer to the collection of following Dynamics 365 apps and its related services:
- Dynamics 365 Sales
- Dynamics 365 Customer Service
- Dynamics 365 Marketing 
- Dynamics 365 Field Service
- Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation

For "online" customers, these apps are **model-driven apps** running on [Common Data Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro). You can build model-driven apps using PowerApps. More information: [What are model-driven apps?](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-overview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The content in this guide is for existing subscribers still using the Dynamics 365 Admin center, which was used to manage Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement instances. We are transitioning instance (now called environment) management to the [Power Platform Admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com). For the latest documentation, see [Power Platform admin guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/admin-documentation).
