# Audit data and user activity for security and compliance

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

The [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] auditing feature logs changes that are made to customer records and user access so you can review the activity later. The auditing feature is designed to meet the auditing, compliance, security, and governance policies of many regulated enterprises.  
<!-- 
> [!NOTE]
> This topic describes the process for enabling and viewing activities for a specific set of entities and attributes. For a auditing at a broader entity level with multiple records, consider using Activity Logging. See [Enable and use Activity Logging](enable-use-comprehensive-auditing.md).
-->
 The audit logs help the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] Administrator answer questions such as:  
  
-   Which user was accessing the system and when?  
  
-   Who updated this field value on this record and when?  
  
-   What was the previous field value before it was updated?  
  
-   What actions has this user taken recently?  
  
-   Who deleted this record?  
  
-   What locale was used to make the update?  
  
The following operations can be audited:  
  
-   Create, update, deactivate, and delete operations on records.  
  
-   Changes to the sharing privileges of a record.  
  
-   The N:N association or disassociation of records.  
  
-   Changes to security roles.  
  
-   Audit changes at the entity, attribute, and organization level. For example, enabling audit on an entity.  
  
-   Deletion of audit logs.  
  
-   For changes made to entity fields that can be localized, such as the Product entity name or description fields, the locale ID (LCID) appears in the audit record.  
  
System administrators and customizers can start or stop auditing for an organization.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  For [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_op_edition](../includes/pn-crm-onprem.md)], you may notice that auditing can significantly increase the size of the organization database over time. You can delete audit logs by going to **Settings** > **Auditing** > **Audit Log Management**. Additionally, you may want to stop auditing for maintenance purposes. Stopping auditing stops tracking for the organization during the period until auditing is started again. When you start auditing again, the same auditing selection is maintained that was previously used.
