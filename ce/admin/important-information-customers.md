# Important information for CRM Online customers

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

Microsoft is introducing [Dynamics 365](https://www.microsoft.com/dynamics365/home), the next generation of intelligent business applications that enable your organization to grow, evolve, and transform to meet the needs of your customers and capture new opportunities. As a result, Microsoft introduced new plans for customers November 1, 2016, that are similar, but not identical to your current plan.  
  
 The existing Dynamics CRM Online plan will be retired effective November 1, 2016. However, if you have a current subscription, this change won’t affect you right away. As a global administrator, you’ll receive email updates and see posts in the message center (part of the [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-office-365-admin-center.md)]) with information on when you need to take action.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Existing customers must choose which [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] licenses meet the needs of their organization.  Simply transitioning existing licenses to the [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] equivalent may not always be the best course of action.  Review the use rights below to determine the mix of user subscriptions that are suitable for your organization’s needs.  Based on the use rights changes with the launch of [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)], this may be different than what you have today.  Review the following information for assistance on how to make your best license choices.  
  
<a name="BKMK_Option1"></a>

<a name="BKMK_Option2"></a>   
### Option 2:  For Professional Users, consider [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_service](../includes/pn-dyn-365-service.md)]

This license includes all core Customer Service functionality – Case Management, Unified Service Desk and scripts, and SLAs and Entitlements management, plus embedded PowerApps, Social Engagement, Gamification, Mobile Offline, and Voice of Customer.

## How to upgrade to Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement Plan or switch to a Dynamics 365 Application  
 You can switch to [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] now, or wait until it’s time to renew, and then upgrade during the renewal process. Either way, you’ll work with your account representative or partner to make the switch, unless you bought your subscription directly from Microsoft, in which case you can switch in the [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-office-365-admin-center.md)].
