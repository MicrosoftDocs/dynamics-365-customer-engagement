# Important information for CRM Online customers

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

Microsoft is introducing [Dynamics 365](https://www.microsoft.com/dynamics365/home), the next generation of intelligent business applications that enable your organization to grow, evolve, and transform to meet the needs of your customers and capture new opportunities. As a result, Microsoft introduced new plans for customers November 1, 2016, that are similar, but not identical to your current plan.  

 The existing Dynamics CRM Online plan will be retired effective November 1, 2016. However, if you have a current subscription, this change won’t affect you right away. As a global administrator, you’ll receive email updates and see posts in the message center (part of the [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-office-365-admin-center.md)]) with information on when you need to take action.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Existing customers must choose which [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] licenses meet the needs of their organization.  Simply transitioning existing licenses to the [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] equivalent may not always be the best course of action.  Review the use rights below to determine the mix of user subscriptions that are suitable for your organization’s needs.  Based on the use rights changes with the launch of [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)], this may be different than what you have today.  Review the following information for assistance on how to make your best license choices.  

<a name="BKMK_Option1"></a>   
### Option 1:  For Enterprise, Professional, Field Service, Project Service Automation, or Basic Users, consider Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement Plan 
 This option is ideal if you want to take advantage of functionality in multiple Dynamics 365 applications, or the new functionality that Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement Plan has to offer. Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement Plan includes Customer Service, Sales, Project Service Automation, Field Service, and PowerApps.  

<a name="BKMK_Option2"></a>   
### Option 2:  For Professional Users, consider [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_service](../includes/pn-dyn-365-service.md)]  
 Choose this option if you want to maintain access to the Customer Service functionality you have today in CRM Online. The Customer Service Application is intended for users who will be engaging in any kind of customer service role, from basic call centers to more advanced support scenarios, focused on case management. This license includes all core Customer Service functionality – Case Management, Unified Service Desk and scripts, and SLAs and Entitlements management, plus embedded PowerApps, Social Engagement, Gamification, Mobile Offline, and Voice of Customer.  

<a name="BKMK_Option3"></a>   
### Option 3:  For Professional Users, consider [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)]  
 Choose this option if you want to maintain access to the Sales functionality you have today in CRM Online. The Sales Application is intended for users who will be engaging in field sales, inside sales, sales management, partner sales, or any other full sales role. This license includes all core sales functionality – Opportunity & Lead Management, Product & Price Lists management, competitor tracking, Quote/Order/Invoice, lightweight marketing capabilities, and Unified Service Desk. This also includes the functionality needed to manage Sales performance plus embedded PowerApps, Social Engagement, Gamification, Mobile Offline, and Voice of Customer.  

<a name="BKMK_Option4"></a>   
### Option 4: For Basic Users, consider [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_service](../includes/pn-dyn-365-service.md)]  
 Choose this option if you want to maintain access to full Customer Service functionality and require write access to Cases. This will get you access to what you have today in CRM Online (minus write access to leads), plus embedded PowerApps, Social Engagement, Gamification, Mobile Offline, and Voice of Customer.  

<a name="BKMK_Option5"></a>   
### Option 5: For Basic Users, consider [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)]  
 Choose this option if you want to maintain access to full Sales functionality and require write access to Cases or Leads. This will get you access to what you have today in CRM Online (minus write access to cases), plus PowerApps, Social Engagement, Gamification, Mobile Offline, and Voice of Customer.  

### Option 6: For Basic Users, consider Dynamics 365 for Team Members 
 Choose this option if you do not need access to full functionality and do not require write access  to Leads. This will get you access to what you have today in CRM Online (minus leads) plus embedded PowerApps.  

<a name="BKMK_Option7"></a>   
### Option 7: For Essential Users, consider Dynamics 365 for Team Members 
 Choose this option to get access to what you have today in CRM Online plus embedded PowerApps.

### Option 8: For Project Service Automation Users, consider [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_project_service_auto](../includes/pn-dyn-365-project-service-auto.md)] or Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement Plan  
 Choose this option if you purchased a Basic User plus Project Service Automation plan. Project Service Automation includes all of the functionality of the Project Service Automation add-on, plus PowerApps, Social Engagement, Gamification, Mobile Offline, Project Online Premium, and Voice of Customer. This would not include write access to cases or leads – for this access the Project Service Automation user should license Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement Plan.  

<a name="BKMK_Option9"></a>   
### Option 9: For Field Service Users, consider [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_field_service](../includes/pn-dyn-365-field-service.md)] or Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement Plan

Either way, you’ll work with your account representative or partner to make the switch, unless you bought your subscription directly from Microsoft, in which case you can switch in the [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-office-365-admin-center.md)].
