# Add an instance to your subscription

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

You can add production and non-production (Sandbox) instances to a [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] subscription. Each new instance creates a separate organization that can be used by different departments, locations, or for non-production purposes such as development. For more information on the instance types available to you, see [Microsoft Dynamics 365 pricing and licensing](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=615167).   
  
 Purchase the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_subsequent](../includes/pn-crm-online-subsequent.md)] instance on the [Microsoft online services portal Purchase subscriptions](https://portal.office.com/Commerce/Catalog.aspx) page. Additional storage and instances can be purchased by customers who have a paid [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] Professional user license subscription.  
  
 You must have the [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Office_365](../includes/pn-ms-office-365.md)] Global administrator to do these tasks. For more information, see [Assigning administrator roles](https://support.office.com/article/Assign-admin-roles-in-Office-365-eac4d046-1afd-4f1a-85fc-8219c79e1504).  
  
<a name="BKMK_info_instance"></a>   
## What information do I need to create an instance?  
 When you add an instance, you can accept the default values, or enter different values to create a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] instance.  
  
- **Select which scenario fits you best**. The apps you can choose depend on the licenses you've purchased. If you haven't purchased any [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] licenses, you'll only see **None of these (don't preinstall any apps)**.  
  
  ![Select an app to configure your instance](../admin/media/select-app-configure-instance.png "Select an app to configure your instance")  
  
- **Name**. This is typically the name of your organization and is displayed in the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] application.  
  
- **URL**. The URL is used to construct the URL for users to sign-in to the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] application. Therefore, we recommend that you limit the length of URL name to reduce the overall length of the URL.  
  
- **Purpose**. This value is used to associate the instance with a specific intent and is only displayed in the instance picker, which is accessed through the [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-dyn-365-admin-center.md)]. For example, if this instance is for exclusive use by your sales and marketing departments you can enter *Contoso Sales and Marketing* or if the instance is for development and for testing purposes enter a relevant name such as *Contoso Development*.  
  
- **Security Group**. This value is used to determine the [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Online_Services](../includes/pn-ms-online-services.md)] security group that includes the users who will have access to this instance of [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)]. For more information, see [Control user access to instances: security groups and licenses](../admin/add-instance-subscription.md#BKMK_man_sec_group).  
  
  > [!IMPORTANT]
  >  If you do not specify a security group, all users associated with the subscription who have a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] license will be added to the new instance.  
  
- **Country/Region**. You can specify a region for the instance.  
  
  > [!NOTE]
  >  To request the ability to create [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] instances (production and non-production) in more than one geographical region, please contact your account manager or [Technical Support](contact-technical-support.md).  
  
- **Currency**. When you add an instance, you must select a base currency before the instance is provisioned. Although you can add currencies in the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] application, only the base currency will be used for reporting.  
  
    > [!WARNING]
    >  Once set, the base currency cannot be changed.

## Add an additional instance  
 The following steps apply to customers who do not purchase using volume licensing. Volume license customers should see: [Microsoft Volume Licensing Service Center](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx).  
  
### Step 1: Purchase the additional instance  
  
1. Sign in to the [Office 365 admin center](https://portal.office.com) as an [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] Global administrator. In the navigation pane, click **Billing** > **Purchase Services**.  
  
2. Scroll down to the **Add-on subscriptions** section, and then hover over **Microsoft Dynamics 365 (online) Additional Non-production Instance** or **Microsoft Dynamics 365 (online) Additional Production Instance**, and then click **Buy now**.  
  
3. Proceed through the screens to purchase additional instances.  
  
    For more information, see [Microsoft Dynamics 365 pricing and licensing](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=615167).  
  
> [!TIP]
>  Close your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] browser session and open a new session to force an update to the **Manage all Dynamics 365 (online) instances** page.  
  
### Step 2: Configure the additional instance  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_office365_signin](../includes/proc-office365-signin.md)]  
  
2. [!INCLUDE[proc_office365_choose_admin_crm](../includes/proc-office365-choose-admin-crm.md)]  
  
3. Choose the **Instances** tab.  
  
4. Select the instance that you want to configure, and then click **Configure**.  
  
   > [!TIP]
   >  If the instance does not appear in the list or is in a state other than **ready to configure**, wait a few minutes and then try again. Or, close your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] browser session and open a new session to force an update to the **Manage all Dynamics 365 (online) instances** page.  
   > 
   >  You cannot start a new [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] instance until you click **Configure** and complete the configuration process.  
   > 
   > [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] instances will not come prepared with sample data when configured by an [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] Global administrator who does not have a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] license. Sample data may be added later, after the instance is configured and ready to use, by a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_subsequent](../includes/pn-crm-online-subsequent.md)] licensed user who has the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] System administrator security role. For more information, see [Add or remove sample data](add-remove-sample-data.md).  
  
5. On the **configure new instance** page, enter your settings, and then click **Next**.  
  
6. On the **Confirm some details** page, verify that the country/region and currency displayed are correct. Although you can add currencies in the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] application, only the base currency will be used for reporting.  
  
   > [!WARNING]
   >  After a base currency is selected it cannot be changed.  
  
    After you have verified that the base currency is correct, click **Finish**.  
  
7. Once your instance is set up, make note of the URL and click or tap it to launch [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)]. Prepare the instance for users by assigning security roles, creating teams, customizing, and importing data. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Getting Started](getting-started.md).

## What is the effect of an additional instance on storage?  
 When you add a new [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] instance, the new instance and any existing instances will consume the existing storage that is available to the account. Warnings will be communicated when storage is near capacity.  
  
<a name="BKMK_man_sec_group"></a>   
## Control user access to instances: security groups and licenses  
 If your company has multiple [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] instances, you can use security groups to control which licensed users can be a member of a particular instance.  
  
 Consider the following example scenario:  
  
|Instance|Security Group|Purpose|  
|--------------|--------------------|-------------|  
|Coho Winery Sales|Sales_SG|Provide access to the organization that creates sales opportunities, handles quotes, and closes deals.|  
|Coho Winery Marketing|Marketing_SG|Provide access to the organization that drives marketing efforts through marketing campaigns and advertising.|  
|Coho Winery Service|Marketing_SG|Provide access to the organization that processes customer cases.|  
|Coho Winery Dev|Developer_SG|Provide access to the Sandbox instance used for development and testing.|  
  
 In this example, four security groups provide controlled access to a specific organization.  
  
 Note the following about security groups:  
  
- When users are added to the security group, they are added to the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] instance.  
  
- When users are removed from the group, they are disabled in the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] instance.  
  
- When a security group is associated with an existing instance with users, all users in the instance that are not members of the group will be disabled.  
  
- If a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] instance does not have an associated security group, all users with a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] license will be created as users and enabled in the instance.  
  
- If a security group is associated with an instance, only users with [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] licenses that are members of the instance security group will be created as users in the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] instance.  
  
- When you remove a security group that is associated with a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] instance, either by editing the instance and removing the security group or by deleting the security group, [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] licensed users who were members of the security group will have the same access to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)].  
  
- When you assign a security group to an instance, that instance will not show up in the **Instances** tab (instance picker) in the [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-dyn-365-admin-center.md)] for users not in the group.  
  
- If you do not assign a security group to an instance, the instance will show up in the **Instances** tab (instance picker) in the [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-dyn-365-admin-center.md)] even for those who have not been assigned a security role in that [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] instance.  
  
- You cannot make security groups members of other security groups.

> [!NOTE]
>  All licensed users, whether or not they are members of the security groups, must be assigned [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] security roles to access [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)]. You assign the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] security roles in the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] web application. Users can’t access instances of [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] until they are assigned at least one security role for that instance. More information: [Grant users access to Microsoft Dynamics 365 (online)](../admin/grant-users-access.md).
