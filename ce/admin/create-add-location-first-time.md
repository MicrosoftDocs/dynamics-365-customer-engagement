# Create or add a document location for the first time

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

Before you can manage documents for a record from [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)], you must create a location record in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] that points to libraries and folders on [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] where the documents will be stored.  
  
1. Open the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] record that has the documents you want to manage.  
  
2. Under **Related**, click or tap**Documents**.  
  
3. If a location isn’t associated, [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] displays the **Add Document Location** dialog box or **Create [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] Location** dialog box. The following table shows the possible scenarios. Depending upon what you see, perform the steps in the “Next steps” column.
