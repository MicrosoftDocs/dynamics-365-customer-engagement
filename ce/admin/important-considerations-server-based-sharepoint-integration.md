Before you move to server-based [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration, review the following table to see some of the differences you’ll experience between client-based versus server-based [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration.

## Known issues with server-based SharePoint integration  
 The [!INCLUDE[pn_list_component_short](../includes/pn-list-component-short.md)] builds the [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] library using the internal name of the document-enabled entity in [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] apps. Server-based [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration uses the entity display name. When you upgrade to server-based [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration, be sure to check that the display names in your document library on [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] match the entity display names in [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] apps.  

 ![SharePoint library name and entity display name](../admin/media/o365-sharepoint-name.png "SharePoint library name and entity display name")  

 These names should match.
