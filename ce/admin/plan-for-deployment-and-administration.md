# Plan for deployment and administration

Your [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] deployment will go more smoothly with some preliminary planning.  The following table lists some of the items to consider before you start the actual deployment process.

Administrative roles define administrative responsibilities related to subscription management activities, for example, billing administration, password administration, and user management administration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                           Consider the available administrative roles and the needs of your environment to identify the roles you want to use and the users you will choose for each role. The global administrator role is the highest level role, having all the permissions to manage any part of the subscription process. We recommend that you assign this role to more than one person so that someone is always available to manage all aspects of the subscription. **Note:**  Administrative roles cover all subscription management functions within the service. These aren’t the same as the security roles that you assign to users in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)], which are required and govern access to resources in the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] service.

Review the documentation associated with each product update before you enable it in a production environment. Additionally, some product updates, such as the sales and service process forms, can’t be removed or easily reverted to the previous functionality. Therefore, you should give careful consideration before you enable a product update.
