# Set up SharePoint integration

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

With [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)], you can use the document management capabilities of [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_SharePoint_long](../includes/pn-ms-sharepoint-long.md)] from within [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)]. You can store and manage documents in the context of a [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] record on a [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_Server_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-server-short.md)], and leverage the [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] infrastructure to share, manage, and collaborate efficiently. Because the documents are stored on a [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_Server_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-server-short.md)], non-[!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] users can directly access the documents on the [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_Server_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-server-short.md)], provided they have the appropriate permissions.  
  
 For document management functionality, you either enable server-based [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration (recommended) or install the [!INCLUDE[pn_list_component_short](../includes/pn-list-component-short.md)], a [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] solution, on a site collection in [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)]. Server-based [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration is recommended instead of the [!INCLUDE[pn_list_component_short](../includes/pn-list-component-short.md)] for the following reasons.  
  
- Users sign-in once and do not have to sign-in to both [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)]. With the list component, users must sign in to both.  
  
- The list component is a [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] sandboxed solution. Sandboxed solutions are being deprecated and will no longer be available for both [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_sharepoint_online](../includes/pn-microsoft-sharepoint-online.md)] and later versions of [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] on-premises. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Sandboxed solutions overview](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/ee721992%28v=office.14%29.aspx)  
  
- No additional software is required to install on [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)].  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] documents will display in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] lists.  
  
- Users can perform [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] actions from the Dynamics 365 command bar.
