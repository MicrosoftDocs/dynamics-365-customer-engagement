# Dynamics 365 (online) Government - Feature availability

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

Microsoft strives to maintain functional parity between our commercially available service and that which is servicing the Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement for U.S. Government - referred to as Dynamics 365 GCC. However, there are notable exceptions to this affected by dependent service or partner-solution availability, market priorities, or compliance regulations.

At this time, preview features in the commercial offering are not available to Dynamics 365 Government Community Cloud (GCC) customers. This is intentional, as the GCC represents a community leveraging our generally available services, further protected with heightened compliance demands of the U.S. Government and Government community customers.

Dynamics 365 GCC currently supports the following versions:

- Dynamics 365, version 8.2
- Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online 2016, Update 1

There are certain experiences that are currently not available with Dynamics 365 GCC.  We continue to evaluate these for incorporation into future releases. The following generally available features are not currently available:
