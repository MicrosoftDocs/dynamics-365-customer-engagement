# For partners -- Get the credit when your customers subscribe

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

As a [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] partner, you can help your customer sign up for a [!INCLUDE[pn_Online_Subscription](../includes/pn-online-subscription.md)]. You can customize and set up their organization for them, and reduce their effort to get started. After signing up, you can designate your company as the customer’s partner of record. As the partner of record, you can help to ensure that your customer has a great trial experience and start them down the path toward success with [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].  
  
 This document describes in detail the tasks you must complete to sign up for [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] on behalf of your customer. It also describes the tasks a customer must do to remove your administrative privileges from the customer's company to ensure that they won’t be charged for your access after the trial is complete.  
  
<a name="BKMK_OneSignupfor"></a>   
## Sign up for a free trial subscription  
 Using a [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Live_ID](../includes/pn-windows-live-id.md)], which can be your ID or your customer’s, sign up for a free trial of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]. The free 30-day trial subscription includes 20 user licenses and 5 gigabytes (GB) of storage. You can activate your customer’s trial subscription as a paying subscription at any time during the first 30 days. If you sign up for the trial subscription using your customer's [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Live_ID](../includes/pn-windows-live-id.md)], you won't need to worry about transferring ownership of the account later on.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> When signing up for the free trial, note the following:  
>   
> -   Make sure to select the correct country/region for your customer. The country/region is important for setting up your customer's billing.  
>   
> -    If the customer doesn’t have a billing address in the country/region you select, their account can’t be activated later.  
> -   When you accept the terms of service, you're accepting it on behalf of your customer and representing their agreement to our terms.  
  
1. Go to [Dynamics 365](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=204374).  
  
    – OR -  
  
    If you received an email with the customer’s invitation, click the link.  
  
2. Click **Take the TestDrive** and then fill in the information to start a TestDrive.  
  
   Soon after you complete the sign up, you’ll be notified by email that the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] trial subscription is ready. You’ll also receive email messages that provide help for new organizations during the first 30 days of their subscription. Forward these email messages to your customer.  
  
<a name="BKMK_TwoDesignateyourself"></a>   
## Designate yourself as the partner of record  
 After completing the trial sign up, designate your company as the partner of record who is responsible for the customer. As the partner of record, you can help [!INCLUDE[cc_Microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] provide our partners and customers with the best service and support. After the trial subscription becomes a paid subscription, your partner company can also claim the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] Software Advisor (CSA) fee for the subscription. For information about the CSA fee program, visit the [Microsoft Partner Network](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=532917) site. <!--, where you can download the [Dynamics 365 Software Advisor Operations Guide and FAQ](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=204192), which provides detailed instructions for the fee claim process.  -->
  
 If your customer has already signed up for a [!INCLUDE[pn_Online_Subscription](../includes/pn-online-subscription.md)], or prefers to sign up for the trial subscription themselves, they can still designate your company as the partner of record.  
  
1. Go to the [Partner of Record Designation](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=204179) page in CustomerSource.  
  
2. Sign in with the same [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Live_ID](../includes/pn-windows-live-id.md)] that you used to sign up for the trial subscription.  
  
    If this [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Live_ID](../includes/pn-windows-live-id.md)] is associated with more than one [!INCLUDE[pn_Online_Subscription](../includes/pn-online-subscription.md)], select your customer’s organization.  
  
3. search for your partner company’s account, and then select **[!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]** as the product line from the drop-down list.  
  
   > [!TIP]
   >  You can search for your partner company by company name, phone number, or their 10-digit partner MBS authorization number.  
  
4. Select your company from the search results, and then click **Associate**.

## Transfer ownership after completing the trial  
 After the trial period is complete and your customer is ready to start their subscription, there are a few steps you need to complete in order to transfer ownership of the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] instance. If you signed up for the [!INCLUDE[pn_Online_Subscription](../includes/pn-online-subscription.md)] on behalf of the customer by using a [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Live_ID](../includes/pn-windows-live-id.md)] other than your customer’s, call [Dynamics 365 Customer Service and support](billing-support.md) to request a transfer of ownership of the subscription to your customer and designate him or her as the billing administrator of the customer’s [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] organization. The billing administrator can take actions that have financial implications to the [!INCLUDE[pn_Online_Subscription](../includes/pn-online-subscription.md)], such as:  
  
- Upgrading to a different subscription  
  
- Upgrading to a different release  
  
- Purchasing additional licenses  
  
- Purchasing additional storage  
  
  > [!TIP]
  >  If you used a [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Live_ID](../includes/pn-windows-live-id.md)] that belongs to someone in your customer’s organization, or that can be transferred to your customer, skip this task. Give the email address and its password to your customer.  
  
  To transfer the ownership of the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] trial subscription, you’ll need the following:

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  >  Each organization must have a billing administrator.  
  
- The [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Live_ID](../includes/pn-windows-live-id.md)] that was used to sign up for the subscription.  
  
- The name of the company used to create the trial subscription.  
  
   You’ll need this name to identify your customer's company if there is more than one account registered at the [Microsoft Billing and Account Management](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=204182) site.  
  
- If the free trial subscription has already been activated to a paying subscription, you’ll also need the credit card number used to pay for the subscription.
