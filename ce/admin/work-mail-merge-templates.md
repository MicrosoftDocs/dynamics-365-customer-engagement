# Work with mail merge templates

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

You can use mail merge templates with Office Word to create customer-ready letters, faxes, e-mail messages, and quotes.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Word_Full](../includes/pn-ms-word-short.md)] templates are created and edited in [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Word_short](../includes/pn-ms-word-short.md)], but can be uploaded to [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] to use with mail merge and share with other users. Only [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Word_short](../includes/pn-ms-word-short.md)] .xml documents can be used as templates. To learn more about how to create mail merge templates, see the online Help in [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Word_Full](../includes/pn-ms-word-short.md)].

6. You can enter a description of the template. This is not displayed to the recipient.  
  
7. Enter the **Ownership** and **Owner** information. Use the handy tooltips as a guide.  
  
8. If you have enabled additional languages, you can select one for the template.  
  
9. To attach the template, click **Browse**, search for the template on your computer, and then click **Attach**. Only .xml documents can be uploaded.  
  
10. When youâ€™re done, click **Save and close**.  
  
> [!NOTE]
