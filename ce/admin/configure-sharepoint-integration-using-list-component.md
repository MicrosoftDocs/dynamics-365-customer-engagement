# Configure SharePoint integration using the list component

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

If you can’t use server-based [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration, you must install the [!INCLUDE[pn_list_component_short](../includes/pn-list-component-short.md)] to get document management functionality. The [!INCLUDE[pn_list_component_short](../includes/pn-list-component-short.md)] is a [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] solution that you upload and activate on a [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] site collection. This feature uses a client-to-[!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_Server_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-server-short.md)] strategy to authenticate and transmit data.  
  
> [!WARNING]
> [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_sharepoint_online](../includes/pn-microsoft-sharepoint-online.md)] has removed code-based sandbox solutions. Notice that the [!INCLUDE[pn_list_component_short](../includes/pn-list-component-short.md)] is a sandboxed solution that requires a [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] sandbox environment.  
> 
> - If you're integrating [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] with [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] for the first time, use server-based authentication. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Set up SharePoint integration with Microsoft Dynamics 365](set-up-sharepoint-integration.md)  
> - If you currently use the list component, we strongly recommend that you switch to server-based authentication. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Switching from the list component or changing the deployment](switching-list-component-changing-deployment.md)  
  
1. Make sure that you meet the requirements to use the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] documentation management feature with [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)]. For more information, see [SharePoint Document Management software requirements for Microsoft Dynamics 365](../admin/sharepoint-document-management-software-requirements.md).  
  
2. [!INCLUDE[proc_permissions_system_admin](../includes/proc-permissions-system-admin.md)]  
  
    Check your security role  
  
   - [!INCLUDE[proc_check_your_security_role](../includes/proc-check-your-security-role.md)]  
  
   - [!INCLUDE[proc_dont_have_correct_permissions](../includes/proc-dont-have-correct-permissions.md)]  
  
3. Install the [!INCLUDE[pn_list_component_short](../includes/pn-list-component-short.md)] on the [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] server.  
  
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   >  The [!INCLUDE[pn_list_component_short](../includes/pn-list-component-short.md)] is not required when you use server-based [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration. For more information, see [Set up SharePoint integration with Microsoft Dynamics 365](../admin/set-up-sharepoint-integration.md) .  
  
   [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_doc_mgmt](../includes/proc-settings-doc-mgmt.md)] On the command bar, click **Install List Component** and follow the instructions here.  
  
   1. Locate the folder where you downloaded `CRM2016-SharePointList2013-ENU-amd64.exe` or `CRM2016-SharePointList2010-ENU-amd64.exe`, and open it.  
  
   2. Select **Click here** to accept the license agreement.  
  
   3. Select a folder to store the extracted files, and then click **OK**.  
  
   4. If you downloaded CRM2016-SharePointList2013-ENU-amd64.exe, the AllowHtcExtn.ps1 and crmlistcomponent.wsp files are extracted.  
  
       If you downloaded CRM2016-SharePointList2010-ENU-amd64.exe, the crmlistcomponent.wsp file is extracted.  
  
   5. Open your browser, and then in the address bar, type the URL of the site collection where you want to install the [!INCLUDE[pn_list_component_short](../includes/pn-list-component-short.md)], and press **Enter**.  
  
   6. Locate **Solution Gallery** in [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)]:

      - If you’re using [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_sharepoint_2013](../includes/pn-microsoft-sharepoint-2013.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_sharepoint_online](../includes/pn-sharepoint-online.md)]: Click the **Settings** button in the top-right corner, then **Site Settings**, and then under **Web Designer Galleries**, click **Solutions**.  
  
      > [!NOTE]
      >  If you don’t see the **Solutions** link, check the custom script setting. In the [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-office-365-admin-center.md)], click **Admin** > **Settings**. Under **Custom Script**, click **Allow users to run custom script on self-service created sites**. Click **OK**. Changes may take up to 24 hours to take effect.  
  
   7. On the **Solutions** tab, in the **New** group, click **Upload Solution**.  
  
   8. Click **Browse**, locate the crmlistcomponent.wsp file, click **Open**, and then click **OK**.

## Allow HTC files in SharePoint 2013  
 By default, HTML component (.htc) files aren’t enabled on [!INCLUDE[pn_sharepoint_2013](../includes/pn-sharepoint-2013.md)]. To enable HTC, follow these steps.  
  
1. Open [!INCLUDE[pn_PowerShell_short](../includes/pn-powershell-short.md)] and navigate to the location where you downloaded and extracted the [!INCLUDE[pn_list_component_short](../includes/pn-list-component-short.md)] to.  
  
2. Type the following command, where *https://mysharepointserver/Dynamics365* is the URL where the list component solution is installed, and then press **ENTER**.  
  
   ```ms-dos  
   ./AllowHtcExtn.ps1 https://mysharepointserver/CRM  
   ```
