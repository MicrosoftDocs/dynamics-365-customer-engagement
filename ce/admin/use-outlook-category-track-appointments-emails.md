# Use Outlook category to track appointments and emails

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>Applies to Dynamics 365 (online) version 8.2

Server-side synchronization now allows tracking of emails, appointments and tasks in Outlook with a [special category](https://support.office.com/article/video-set-an-email-flag-reminder-or-color-a894348d-b308-4185-840f-aff63063d076?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US) **Tracked to Dynamics 365**. Assigning this category to an email, appointment or a task in Outlook syncs the item to Dynamics 365. Similarly, removing the category from a tracked email, appointment or task untracks it from Dynamics 365.

You can also select multiple items and assign the **Tracked to Dynamics 365** Outlook category to them thereby tracking all of them to Dynamics 365. Quickly identify tracked items by observing the presence of this category in your Inbox and other folders.

## Configure category-based tracking through an OrgDBOrgSetting
To enable the special **Tracked to Dynamics 365** Outlook category, you need to enable the OrgDBOrgSetting in your Dynamics 365 organization. Dynamics 365 provides the OrgDBOrgSettings tool that gives administrators the ability to implement specific updates that were previously reserved for registry implementations.

1. Follow the instructions [in this article](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2691237/orgdborgsettings-tool-for-microsoft-dynamics-crm) for steps to extract the tool.
2. After extracting the tool, enable the OrgDBOrgSetting **TrackCategorizedItems**.
3. Enabling the OrgDBOrgSetting will create the category **Tracked to Dynamics 365** on all Exchange mailboxes of the Dynamics 365 organization which have server-side synchronization enabled in about 15 minutes.

You can also use [this tool](https://github.com/seanmcne/OrgDbOrgSettings/releases/) to edit the OrgDBOrgSetting **TrackCategorizedItems**.

> [!NOTE]
> Once the category **Tracked to Dynamics 365** is created, it can be renamed without losing the associated tracking capability. If you delete the category, server-side synchronization will attempt to recreate the category in about 15 minutes.

## Use category to track Outlook items
Once the **Tracked to Dynamics 365** category is available in Outlook, you can use it to track the following Outlook items.

## Email
Track an email by assigning it the **Tracked to Dynamics 365** category. The category assignment can be seen immediately in Outlook. At this time, the email is marked for tracking. server-side synchronization will sync the email to Dynamics 365 within 15 minutes, based on the email synchronization setting.

If an email is tracked and is categorized as **Tracked to Dynamics**, removing the category will untrack the email. However, the corresponding Dynamics 365 email activity record is not deleted.

> [!NOTE]
> You can set up a rule in Outlook to assign or remove a category. See [Manage email messages by using rules](https://support.office.com/article/manage-email-messages-by-using-rules-c24f5dea-9465-4df4-ad17-a50704d66c59?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US).

## Appointment
You can track an appointment by assigning it the **Tracked to Dynamics 365** category. The appointment will be tracked and synced to Dynamics 365 based on server-side synchronization rules.

If an appointment is tracked and is categorized as **Tracked to Dynamics**, removing the category will untrack the appointment. However, the corresponding Dynamics 365 appointment activity record is not deleted.

## Task
> [!NOTE]
> Assignment of tasks to people that is captured in Outlook will not be synced to Dynamics 365.

## Use category-based tracking with App for Outlook
If you have Dynamics 365 App for Outlook, you can use category-based tracking with App for Outlook.

The following table lists different scenarios of tracking.


|Action  |Result  |
|---------|---------|
|Assign the **Tracked to Dynamics 365** category to an email/appointment     |Server-side synchronization will sync email/appointment within 15 minutes. Loading App for Outlook on that item will display the tracked status.         |
|Track an email/appointment using App for Outlook     |Email/Appointment is tracked. The **Tracked to Dynamics 365** category is assigned immediately.         |
|Removal of the **Tracked to Dynamics 365** category on an email/appointment     |Server-side synchronization will untrack the item in about 15 minutes. Loading App for Outlook on that email will display the tracked status. The activity record is not deleted from Dynamics 365.         |
|Untrack an email/appointment using App for Outlook     |Email/Appointment is untracked and **Tracked to Dynamics 365** category is removed.         |

## Delegate users
If you [allow someone else to manage your email and calendar](https://support.office.com/article/Allow-someone-else-to-manage-your-mail-and-calendar-41C40C04-3BD1-4D22-963A-28EAFEC25926) by providing them delegate access, the delegate can access your categories in Outlook, if the delegate has Editor permissions.

If your mailbox has the **Tracked to Dynamics 365** category, the delegate can track your emails and appointments by assigning the **Tracked to Dynamics 365** category.

## Category-based tracking with Dynamics 365 for Outlook
Category-based tracking is not supported with Dynamics 365 for Outlook. We recommend that you do not enable OrgDBOrgSetting **TrackCategorizedItems** on a Dynamics 365 organization set up to use Dynamics 365 for Outlook.

## Disable category-based tracking
You can disable category-based tracking for the Dynamics 365 organization by disabling OrgDBOrgSetting **TrackCategorizedItems**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you disable OrgDBOrgSetting **TrackCategorizedItems**, the **Tracked to Dynamics 365** category is soft-deleted, with the category assignment retained in Outlook. If you delete the category from the master list, it will be deleted permanently.
