# Switching from the list component or changing the deployment

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

Follow the steps described here to switch from the list component to server-based authentication or if you change the [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_SharePoint_long](../includes/pn-ms-sharepoint-long.md)] deployment type, such as moving from [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] on-premises to [!INCLUDE[pn_sharepoint_online](../includes/pn-sharepoint-online.md)].

## Switch from list component to server-based authentication  
 If your organization is already using the list component with [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_SharePoint_long](../includes/pn-ms-sharepoint-long.md)] for document management with [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)], you can switch to server-based authentication by following these steps.  
  
1. Follow the steps to set up server-based [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration that best fits your deployment type. For more information, see the See Also topics below.  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   >  If you've made changes to [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)], such as new [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] servers, new site collections, or migrated from [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] on-premises to [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_sharepoint_online](../includes/pn-microsoft-sharepoint-online.md)], consider deactivating outdated [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] site records. When you run the Enable Server-Based SharePoint Integration wizard, the wizard will attempt to validate all active [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] sites. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Deactivate a site](../admin/switching-list-component-changing-deployment.md#BKMK_deact_site)  
  
2. Although it is not required for server-based authentication, we recommend that you deactivate and then delete the list component [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] solution from the [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] site collection. To do this, after you have confirmed that server-based authentication is enabled, in a web browser sign-in to the site collection, click the **Settings** button in the top-right corner, then **Site Settings**, and then under **Web Designer Galleries**, click **Solutions**. Choose **crmlistcomponent**, and then on the tool bar click **Deactivate**. Choose the **crmlistcomponent** again, and then on the tool bar click **Delete**.

## Changing the SharePoint deployment type  
  
1. After the migration of [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_SharePoint_long](../includes/pn-ms-sharepoint-long.md)] to either online or on-premises is completed, deactivate the outdated [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] site records. You must do this because, when you run the Enable Server-Based SharePoint Integration wizard, the wizard will attempt to validate all active [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] sites. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Deactivate a site](../admin/switching-list-component-changing-deployment.md#BKMK_deact_site)  
  
2. Follow the steps to set up server-based [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration that best fits your deployment type. For more information, see the See Also topics below.

## Deactivate a site  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_doc_management](../includes/proc-settings-doc-management.md)]  
  
2. Click **SharePoint Sites**.  
  
3. Select the [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] site you want to remove, and then on the tool bar select **Deactivate**.  
  
4. Repeat step three for all sites that you want to deactivate.
