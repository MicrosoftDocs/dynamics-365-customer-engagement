# Move an instance to a different tenant

You can request to have an instance in one tenant moved to another tenant. To do so, [contact technical support](contact-technical-support.md) and submit a support request.

Once your request is received and acted on, expect some downtime while the instance is moved.

> [!NOTE]
> This is available for Dynamics 365 version 8.x only and not version 9.x.
