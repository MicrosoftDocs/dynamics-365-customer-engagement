# What fields can be synchronized with Outlook?

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

[!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] administrators can set whether a sync occurs and the sync direction for [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_dynamics_crm_for_outlook](../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-for-outlook.md)] fields.  
  
 ![Appointment fields for synchronization](../admin/media/appointment-field-sync.png "Appointment fields for synchronization")  
  
 You can set synchronization for the entities listed in the following tables. For information on how to set field synchronization, see [Control field synchronization between Dynamics 365 and Outlook or Exchange](control-field-synchronization-outlook.md)

 **Notes**  
  
1. **Organizer:** In [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] sync, an appointment created in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] will not result in filling in the [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] Organizer field until it is further modified in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)]. This applies to Appointment, Recurring Appointment, and Service Activity. In server-side sync, a service activity created in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] will result in filling in the [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] Organizer field with the person who synchronizes this appointment.  
  
2. **Regarding:** When you do a **Set Regarding**, the Regarding field in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] is replaced by the name of the regarding object from [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. Until you sync, the **Set Regarding** action in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] and in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] should not change the Regarding field in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)].

 **Notes**  
  
1. **Parent (Regarding):** When you do a **Set Regarding**, the Company field in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] is replaced by the name of the regarding object from [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. If not syncing, the set regarding action in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] and in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] should not change the Company field in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)]. Users can control updating the Company field for [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] contacts in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)]. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Set personal options that affect tracking and synchronization between Dynamics 365 and Outlook or Exchange](set-personal-options-affect-tracking-synchronization-between-dynamics-365-outlook-exchange.md)  
  
2.  When the Contact entity is deactivated (**Status Reason: Inactive**), the [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] field in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] will have **Category [Dynamics 365] Inactive**. This is to help differentiate the inactive vs. active status from a pool of tracked [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] contacts.

 **Notes**  
  
1. **Due Date:** Includes Date and Time. When a task is created in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)], the system assigns the task a reminder time. Reminder information is not synced from [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. However, when a task has Due Time set in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], it will be synchronized to reminder time in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)].  
  
     If there is a Start Date value but no Due Date value in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)]/[!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)], [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)]/[!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] will auto fill the Due Date value with the Start Date whenever you change the Start Date directly in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)]; if there is Start Date value but no Due Date value in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] will auto fill the Due Date value with the Start Date.

2. **Regarding:** When you do a **Set Regarding**, the Regarding field in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] is replaced by the name of the regarding object from [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)].

 **Notes**  
  
1. **Due Date:** Includes Date and Time. When a task is created in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)], the system assigns the task a reminder time. Reminder information is not synced from [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. However, when a task has Due Time set in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], it will be synchronized to reminder time in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)].  
  
     If there is a Start Date value but no Due Date value in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)]/[!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)], [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)]/[!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] will auto fill the Due Date value with the Start Date whenever you change the Start Date directly in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)]; if there is Start Date value but no Due Date value in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] will auto fill the Due Date value with the Start Date.

2. **Regarding:** When you do a **Set Regarding**, the Regarding field in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] is replaced by the name of the regarding object from [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. Until you sync, the **Set Regarding** action in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] and in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] should not change the Regarding field in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)].  
  
3. **Start Date:** When a task is created and tracked in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)], the system assigns the task a reminder time. Reminder information is not synced from [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. However, when a task has Due Time set in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], it will be synchronized to Reminder Time in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)].
