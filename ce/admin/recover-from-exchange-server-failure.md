# Recover from Exchange Server failure

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

The process to restore a [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange_Server_full](../includes/pn-exchange-server-full.md)] computer that is used by [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] depends on how that instance of [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange_Server_short](../includes/pn-exchange-server-short.md)] is being used. The only time [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]-related data exists on [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange_Server_short](../includes/pn-exchange-server-short.md)] occurs when you use a forward mailbox with the [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_E-Mail_Router](../includes/pn-crm-e-mail-router.md)] or server-side synchronization. [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] doesn’t directly use [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange_Server_short](../includes/pn-exchange-server-short.md)] mailboxes.  
  
## Restore Exchange Server in a Dynamics 365 environment  
  
1. Restore [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange_Server_short](../includes/pn-exchange-server-short.md)].  
  
2. If the Email Router was installed on the computer that is running [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange_Server_short](../includes/pn-exchange-server-short.md)] (not recommended), reinstall the Email Router.  
  
3. Restore the Microsoft.Crm.Tools.EmailAgent.xml file. By default, this file is located in the C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics 365 Email\Service folder on the computer where the Email Router is installed. If this file isn’t available, you must reconfigure the profiles, settings, users, queue, and forward-mailbox information by running the Email Router Configuration Manager.
