# Cancel your subscription

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

We are sorry that you are considering canceling your subscription with [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]. This topic contains information you’ll need before you cancel your subscription. For additional details, see Section 4 of the [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Online Service Agreement](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=269924).

## Before you call  
 Before you call, make sure that you have the following information ready:  
  
- Billing administrator's [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Live_ID](../includes/pn-windows-live-id.md)] and password  
  
- Organization URL and name  
  
- The day that you want your subscription to [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] terminated  
  
You should have also made the following decisions:  
  
-   Do you want to keep your existing data?  
  
-   Do you want to keep any Internet Marketing service campaigns running? If you aren’t the person who signed up for the service, you must work with that person to cancel or maintain it.

## Canceling your Dynamics 365 subscription  
 If you have been using [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] for training, demonstrations, or testing and you don’t want to keep any of your data, you can simply contact billing support with the information in [Before you call](../admin/cancel-subscription.md#BKMK_BeforeYouCall). On the [Billing and subscription support](billing-support.md) page select [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)]. If you want to save your data, you need to also do the following:  
  
- If you want to keep the data, you can export the data. For more information, see [Export Data to Excel](../basics/export-data-excel.md).  
  
- If you want to keep your Internet Marketing service campaigns running, don’t delete the activities. Search engine ads will continue to run. After the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] cancellation, you can cancel or manage the campaigns from [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Ad_Center](../includes/pn-ms-ad-center.md)].  
  
- To stop the search engine ads, delete or pause all your current Internet Marketing service campaign activities. This will also stop the billing from [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Ad_Center](../includes/pn-ms-ad-center.md)] with [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Ad_Center](../includes/pn-ms-ad-center.md)] with your [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Ad_Center](../includes/pn-ms-ad-center.md)] credentials to cancel the account.

## Canceling your Dynamics 365 (online) subscription as part of your migration to Dynamics 365 (on-premises)  
 If you have decided to migrate to [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] (on-premises Edition), you first migrate your data and then cancel your [!INCLUDE[pn_Online_Subscription](../includes/pn-online-subscription.md)]. To begin the migration process, you will need to work with one of the following Microsoft support teams.  
  
- If you're on the [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Online_Services](../includes/pn-ms-online-services.md)] platform for [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] (most customers are), contact [Technical support](contact-technical-support.md).  
  
- If you're on the Microsoft Commerce Transaction Platform, contact Billing support.  
  
   Select the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] tab on the [Billing and subscription support](billing-support.md) page for help to determine which platform you are on.  
  
[!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] customer service will process your request, transfer your data to a secure site at the requested time, and notify your IT department that the data is available to be downloaded.  
  
When migration is complete, you then cancel your [!INCLUDE[pn_Online_Subscription](../includes/pn-online-subscription.md)]. More information:  [Billing FAQs for Dynamics 365 (online)](billing-faqs-dynamics-365-online.md).

## Canceling only the Internet Marketing service  
 If you’re the billing administrator for an Internet Marketing service campaign used by a [!INCLUDE[pn_Online_Subscription](../includes/pn-online-subscription.md)], you can cancel it even if you aren’t the billing administrator of the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] organization. To stop the search engine ads, delete or pause all your current Internet Marketing service campaign activities. This will also stop the billing from [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Ad_Center](../includes/pn-ms-ad-center.md)] with [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Ad_Center](../includes/pn-ms-ad-center.md)] with your [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Ad_Center](../includes/pn-ms-ad-center.md)] credentials to cancel the account.  
  
<a name="BKMK_ChangingMind"></a>   
## Changing your mind  
 You have 30 days to reverse the cancellation and start using [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] again. Contact [Billing and subscription support](billing-support.md) with the same information you used to cancel your subscription. You can’t re-instate a canceled Internet Marketing service campaign, but you can sign up again. For more information, see the [Service Agreement](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=269924).
