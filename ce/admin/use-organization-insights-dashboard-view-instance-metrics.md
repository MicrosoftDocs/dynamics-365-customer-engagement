# Preview feature: Use the Organization Insights dashboard to view metrics about your instance

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

Use the Organization Insights dashboard to get a quick view of key [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] metrics such as the number of active users and page requests.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The Organization Insights dashboard is a preview feature in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_8_1_0_online](../includes/pn-crm-8-1-0-online.md)]. A preview feature is a feature that is not complete, but is made available before it’s officially in a release so customers can get early access and provide feedback. Preview features aren’t meant for production use and may have limited or restricted functionality.  To use this feature, it must be turned on and the license terms must be accepted. [What are Preview features and how do I enable them?](../admin/what-are-preview-features-how-do-i-enable-them.md) [!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_no_MS_support](../includes/cc-preview-features-no-ms-support.md)]  
> 
>  Consider using the new [Organization Insights solution](use-organization-insights-solution-view-instance-metrics.md) for a richer view of your instance metrics. Organization Insights dashboard will remain a preview feature and will be deprecated once the Organization Insights solution is fully available.  
  
 Note the following:  
  
-   In all charts, you can select a two hour (2H), forty-eight hour (48H) or thirty-day (30D) time period for data to be included in the chart. Data is refreshed as shown in the following table.  
  
    |Lookback period|Data aggregation interval|  
    |---------------------|-------------------------------|  
    |2H|5 minutes|  
    |48H|1 hour|  
    |30D|1 day|  
  
-   Expect a data synchronization delay of approximately 45 minutes or more. For example, at 4:30 PM, a 2 hour (2H) lookback might show data in the chart for 1:45 PM to 3:45 PM.  
  
-   Aggregation intervals use the UTC time standard and not the user-defined time zone.  
  
-   If a chart has multiple elements such as Most Active Users, you can click the chart element to switch its display.
