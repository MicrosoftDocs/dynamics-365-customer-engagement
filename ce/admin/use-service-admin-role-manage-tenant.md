# Use the service admin role to manage your tenant 

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

To help you administer [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)], you can assign users to manage [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] at the tenant level without having to assign the more powerful [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] global admin privileges.  
  
 Users with the [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] service admin role can:  
  
-   Sign in to and manage  multiple [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] instances. If an instance uses a security group, a service administrator would need to be added to the security group in order to manage that instance.  
  
-   Perform admin functions in [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] because they have the [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] system admin role. The service admin must be assigned a [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] license.  
  
A [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] service admin cannot do functions restricted to the [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] global admin such as manage user accounts, manage subscriptions, access settings for [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] apps like [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)].  
  
> [!NOTE]
> The [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] service admin can manage instances of version 8.1 ([!INCLUDE[pn_crm_8_1_0_online](../includes/pn-crm-8-1-0-online.md)]) or later.

 Here's a matrix of what's available with the various [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] roles.

<sup>1</sup>To approve emails for Dynamics 365 (online), a Dynamics user requires the **Approve Email Addresses for Users or Queues** privilege and the **Office 365 global admin** role.

To approve emails for Dynamics 365 (on-premises), a Dynamics user requires the **Approve Email Addresses for Users or Queues** privilege.  A system admin can assign the **Approve Email Addresses for Users or Queues** privilege to any security role and assign the security role to any user. 

To manually assign the **Approve Email Addresses for Users or Queues** privilege to a security role: 
1. In Dynamics 365, go to **Settings** > **Security** > **Security Roles**. 
2. Select a security role, and then select the **Business Management** tab. 
3. Under **Miscellaneous Privileges**, set the privilege level for **Approve Email Addresses for Users or Queues**.
