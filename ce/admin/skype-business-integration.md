If your organization uses [!INCLUDE[pn_skype_for_business](../includes/pn-skype-for-business.md)] (formerly known as [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Lync](../includes/pn-microsoft-lync.md)]) or [!INCLUDE[pn_skype](../includes/pn-skype.md)], you can take advantage of connectivity features like click-to-call or checking user availability from within [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_dynamics_crm_for_outlook](../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-for-outlook.md)].

## Using Skype for Business with Dynamics 365  

 When you use [!INCLUDE[pn_skype_for_business](../includes/pn-skype-for-business.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] together, you can use [!INCLUDE[pn_skype_for_business](../includes/pn-skype-for-business.md)]) presence and click-to-call from within [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].  
  
 Your organization must have one of the following products or subscriptions:  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_skype_for_business](../includes/pn-skype-for-business.md)]  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_skype_for_business_server_2015](../includes/pn-skype-for-business-server-2015.md)]  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_lync_server_2013](../includes/pn-ms-lync-server-2013.md)]  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Lync_Server_2010](../includes/pn-ms-lync-server-2010.md)]  
  
  **Client requirements and [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] configuration**  
  
- To use click-to-call, [!INCLUDE[pn_skype_for_business](../includes/pn-skype-for-business.md)] must be selected as the telephony provider in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]. You can set this on the General tab at Settings > Administration > System Settings.  
  
- By default, [!INCLUDE[pn_skype_for_business](../includes/pn-skype-for-business.md)] presence is enabled in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]. System administrators can enable or disable presence in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]. To do this, click **Settings** > **Administration** > **System Settings** and on the **General** tab, **Set the IM presence option** to **Yes** or **No**.  
  
- Each user must have the [!INCLUDE[pn_skype_for_business](../includes/pn-skype-for-business.md)] client installed and running on their PC.  
  
- For [!INCLUDE[pn_skype_for_business](../includes/pn-skype-for-business.md)] presence, [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] users must have `https://*.dynamics.com` added to their web browsers trusted sites list in Internet options in [!INCLUDE[pn_Internet_Explorer](../includes/pn-internet-explorer.md)].
