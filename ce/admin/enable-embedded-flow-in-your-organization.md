# Enable embedded Flow to automate processes

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

Flow lets you create automated processes between your favorite apps and services. The ability to run flows from within [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] makes it simple for users to combine a broad spectrum of services that can be initiated from within [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], such as messaging, social engagement, and document routing services.  

[!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] instances use the default Flow environment. For more information about Flow environments, see [Using environments within Microsoft Flow](https://flow.microsoft.com/documentation/environments-overview-admin/)
  
The embedded Flow feature is not available in the following service or geographic regions.
- Microsoft Dynamics 365 Government
- Germany
- United Kingdom (UK)
- South America

  Once the embedded Flows feature is enabled, the following privileges are added in the **Miscellaneous** section of the **Customization** tab for security roles.  
  
- Name: prvFlow  
  
- Name: prvFlow  
  
## Prerequisites  
  
- A Flow connection for [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] (recommended). [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Connectors](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/)  
  
- One or more flows created in the Flow environment to use with [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Create a flow by using Dynamics 365 (online)](https://flow.microsoft.com/documentation/connection-dynamics365/)
