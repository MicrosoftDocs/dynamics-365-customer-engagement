# Connect Dynamics 365 (online) to Exchange Server (on-premises)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

With [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_9_0_0_online](../includes/pn-crm-9-0-0-online.md)], you can connect your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] with [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange_Server_full](../includes/pn-exchange-server-full.md)] (on-premises).  

 Check out the following white paper: [Setup Guide: Server-side synchronization for CRM Online and Exchange Server](http://download.microsoft.com/download/E/D/0/ED05CA70-190F-4BAE-9F6A-0BB2F0010B81/Setup%20Guide%20Server-side%20synchronization%20for%20CRM%20Online%20and%20Exchange%20Server.pdf)  

<a name="BKMK_PreReq"></a>   
## Prerequisites  

1. **Exchange Server**. The following versions are supported: [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Exchange_Server_2010_short](../includes/pn-ms-exchange-server-2010-short.md)] SP3, [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange_Server_2013_short](../includes/pn-exchange-server-2013-short.md)] SP1, or [!INCLUDE[pn_exchange_server_2016_short](../includes/pn-exchange-server-2016-short.md)].  

2. **Authentication**. During installation, [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] configures [!INCLUDE[pn_Internet_Information_Services](../includes/pn-internet-information-services.md)]. To connect [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] with [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange_Server_short](../includes/pn-exchange-server-short.md)], Windows or Basic authentication must be enabled in [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange_Server_short](../includes/pn-exchange-server-short.md)].  

     For more information on authentication, see:  

   - [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Exchange_Server_2010_short](../includes/pn-ms-exchange-server-2010-short.md)]: [Configure Integrated Windows Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/office/exchange-server-2010/aa998638(v%3dexchg.141))

   - [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Exchange_Server_2010_short](../includes/pn-ms-exchange-server-2010-short.md)]: [Configure Basic Authentication](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/aa996407\(v=exchg.141\).aspx)  

   - [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Exchange_Server_2010_short](../includes/pn-ms-exchange-server-2010-short.md)]: [Default Authentication Settings for Exchange-related Virtual Directories](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/gg247612\(v=exchg.141\).aspx)  

   - [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange_Server_2013_short](../includes/pn-exchange-server-2013-short.md)]: [Authentication and EWS in Exchange](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/dn626019\(v=exchg.150\).aspx)  

   - [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange_Server_2013_short](../includes/pn-exchange-server-2013-short.md)]: [Default settings for Exchange virtual directories](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/gg247612\(v=exchg.150\).aspx) 

   - [!INCLUDE [pn-exchange-server-2016-short](../includes/pn-exchange-server-2016-short.md)]: [Default settings for Exchange virtual directories](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/gg247612(v=exchg.160).aspx)

3. **ApplicationImpersonation role**. You need to create and configure a service account with the **ApplicationImpersonation** role in [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Exchange](../includes/pn-microsoft-exchange.md)]. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Impersonation and EWS in Exchange](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/dn722377\(v=exchg.150\).aspx).  

4. **Secured connection**. The connection between [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] and Exchange must be encrypted via [!INCLUDE[pn_ssl_short](../includes/pn-ssl-short.md)] (HTTPS).  

5. **Exchange Web Services (EWS)**. Connections to EWS must be allowed through the firewall. Often a reverse proxy is used for the exterior facing connection.  

> [!TIP]
>  To make sure youâ€™ve got a good connection to [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] on-premises run the [Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer](https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/). For information on what tests to run, see [Test mail flow with the Remote Connectivity Analyzer](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn305950\(v=exchg.150\).aspx).

Increase the value to allow more parallel calls to [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] to improve performance or reduce the value if there are errors on [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] due to large number of calls from [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].

The maximum number is considered per mailbox or per email server profile depending on whether the credentials are specified in a mailbox or email server profile. |

4. Click **Save**.  

5. Click **Test Connection** and review the results. To diagnose issues, see the following section.

### Troubleshooting the Exchange Server (Hybrid) profile connection  
 If youâ€™ve run **Test Connection** and have issues with the Exchange Server (Hybrid) profile connection, use the information in the **Test Connection** dialog box to diagnose and fix the connection.  

 ![Review the error messages](../admin/media/server-side-sync-exchange-hybrid-troubleshoot.png "Review the error messages")  

 In this case, thereâ€™s a problem with Auto Discover. The admin should review the user name and password used for **Authentication Using Impersonation** for the Exchange Server (Hybrid) profile.  

 You can find information on recurring issues and other troubleshooting information in [Blog: Test and Enable Mailboxes in Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2015](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/crm/archive/2015/08/31/test-and-enable-mailboxes-in-microsoft-dynamics-crm-2015.aspx) and [Troubleshooting and monitoring server-side synchronization](../admin/troubleshooting-monitoring-server-side-synchronization.md).

## Configure default email processing and synchronization  
 Set server-side synchronization to be the default configuration method.  

1. Go to **Settings** > **Email Configuration** > **Email Configuration Settings**.  

2. Set the processing and synchronization fields as follows:  

   - **Server Profile**: The profile you created in the above section.  

   - **Incoming Email**: Server-Side Synchronization or Email Router  

   - **Outgoing Email**: Server-Side Synchronization or Email Router  

   - **Appointments, Contacts, and Tasks**: Server-Side Synchronization or Email Router  

     If you leave the **Email processing form unapproved user and queues** at the default values (checked), you will need to approve emails and queues for user mailboxes as directed below in **Approve Email**.

## Configure mailboxes  
 To set mailboxes to use the default profile, you must first set the Server Profile and the delivery method for email, appointments, contacts, and tasks.

 Select **one** of the following methods:  

### Set mailboxes to the default profile

## Test configuration of mailboxes  

1. Go to **Settings** > **Email Configuration** > **Mailboxes**.  

2. Click **Active Mailboxes**.  

3. Select the mailboxes you want to test, and then click **Test & Enable Mailboxes**.  

    This tests the incoming and outgoing email configuration of the selected mailboxes and enables them for email processing. If an error occurs in a mailbox, an alert is shown on the Alerts wall of the mailbox and the profile owner. Depending on the nature of the error, [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] tries to process the email again after some time or disables the mailbox for email processing.  

    The result of the email configuration test is displayed in the **Incoming Email Status**, **Outgoing Email Status**, and **Appointments, Contacts, and Tasks Status** fields of a mailbox record. An alert is also generated when the configuration is successfully completed for a mailbox. This alert is shown to the mailbox owner.  

> [!TIP]
>  If youâ€™re unable to synchronize contacts, appointments, and tasks for a mailbox, you may want to select the **Sync items with Exchange from this Dynamics 365 org only, even if Exchange was set to sync with a different org** check box.

## Test email configuration for all mailboxes associated with an email server profile  

1. Go to **Settings** > **Email Configuration** > **Email Server Profiles**.  

2. Select the profile you created, and then click **Test & Enable Mailboxes**.  

    When you test the email configuration, an asynchronous job runs in the background. It may take a few minutes for the test to be completed. [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] tests the email configuration of all the mailboxes associated with the [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange_Server_short](../includes/pn-exchange-server-short.md)] profile. For the mailboxes configured with server-side synchronization for synchronizing appointments, tasks, and contacts, it also checks to make sure theyâ€™re configured properly.
