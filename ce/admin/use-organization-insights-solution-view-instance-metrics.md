## View data for different time ranges  
 You can adjust the time range for the data presented in the dashboards charts. After selecting the From and To range, click the **Play** button (![Organization Insights Calendar Play button](../admin/media/organization-insights-calendar-play-button.png "Organization Insights Calendar Play button")) to refresh your data.  
  
 ![Select the date range for your data](../admin/media/organization-insights-calendar-control.png "Select the date range for your data")  
  
 Consider the following about the Organization Insights calendar:  
  
-   The Calendar control is not available for the  Storage dashboard and not applicable to any storage related chart as only the latest information is shown for those charts.  
  
-   Default time range is shown for the past 48 hours.  
  
-   Data is only shown for the applied time range.  
  
-   Data is available from the time of release of the solution in AppSource, and will be retained for 30 days.  
  
-   Data is shown for time series at an hourly aggregation interval.  
  
-   The data shown for a hourly aggregation interval represents the whole hour. For example, if the number of active users at 2:00 PM is 5, there were 5 active users between 1:00 and 2:00 PM.

## OData Support
Organization Insights supports retrieving chart data through the Web API OData v4 web service. For information about the Web API, see [Use the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Web API](../developer/use-microsoft-dynamics-365-web-api.md).

The entity set name for the `SavedOrgInsightsConfiguration` entity is `savedorginsightsconfigurations` which needs the `SavedOrgInsightsConfigurationId`, `JSONDataStartTime` and `JSONDataEndTime` to return data in the given time range. The data can then be used to render custom charts or do further post-processing as required.

The following is the format by which data can be retrieved, using the ChartID GUID value for the charts listed above.

```  
[ClientUrl]/api/data/v8.1/savedorginsightsconfigurations?$filter=savedorginsightsconfigurationid eq [ChartID] and jsondatastarttime eq [StartTime] and jsondataendtime eq [EndTime]&$select=jsondata
```  

A sample query with GUID and time ranges populated would look something like the following:

```
[ClientUrl]/api/data/v8.1/savedorginsightsconfigurations?$filter=savedorginsightsconfigurationid eq 5187781c-da7c-4762-aeb3-85f908a2777c and jsondatastarttime eq 2017-07-11T18:30:00.000Z and jsondataendtime eq 2017-07-12T18:30:00.000Z&$select=jsondata
```

The following is a sample result for the query:

```
{
  "@odata.context":"https://[ClientUrl]/api/data/v8.1/$metadata#savedorginsightsconfigurations(jsondata)","value":[
    {
      "jsondata":"{\"RequestId\":\"101fa8c3-1221-4f3c-9cf7-1eb35cf2eeba\",\"Results\":[{\"Dates\":[\"7/10/2017 2:00 PM\",\"7/10/2017 3:00 PM\",\"7/10/2017 4:00 PM\",\"7/10/2017 5:00 PM\",\"7/10/2017 6:00 PM\",\"7/10/2017 7:00 PM\",\"7/10/2017 8:00 PM\",\"7/10/2017 9:00 PM\",\"7/10/2017 10:00 PM\",\"7/10/2017 11:00 PM\",\"7/11/2017 12:00 AM\",\"7/11/2017 1:00 AM\",\"7/11/2017 2:00 AM\",\"7/11/2017 3:00 AM\",\"7/11/2017 4:00 AM\",\"7/11/2017 5:00 AM\",\"7/11/2017 6:00 AM\",\"7/11/2017 7:00 AM\",\"7/11/2017 8:00 AM\",\"7/11/2017 9:00 AM\",\"7/11/2017 10:00 AM\",\"7/11/2017 11:00 AM\",\"7/11/2017 12:00 PM\",\"7/11/2017 1:00 PM\",\"7/11/2017 2:00 PM\",\"7/11/2017 3:00 PM\",\"7/11/2017 4:00 PM\",\"7/11/2017 5:00 PM\",\"7/11/2017 6:00 PM\",\"7/11/2017 7:00 PM\",\"7/11/2017 8:00 PM\",\"7/11/2017 9:00 PM\",\"7/11/2017 10:00 PM\",\"7/11/2017 11:00 PM\",\"7/12/2017 12:00 AM\",\"7/12/2017 1:00 AM\",\"7/12/2017 2:00 AM\",\"7/12/2017 3:00 AM\",\"7/12/2017 4:00 AM\",\"7/12/2017 5:00 AM\",\"7/12/2017 6:00 AM\",\"7/12/2017 7:00 AM\",\"7/12/2017 8:00 AM\",\"7/12/2017 9:00 AM\",\"7/12/2017 10:00 AM\",\"7/12/2017 11:00 AM\",\"7/12/2017 12:00 PM\",\"7/12/2017 1:00 PM\"],\"Rollup\":\"PT1H\",\"Metrics\":[{\"Name\":\"activeusers\",\"Values\":[728.0,645.0,531.0,473.0,528.0,542.0,526.0,498.0,461.0,497.0,557.0,578.0,580.0,585.0,569.0,635.0,786.0,819.0,877.0,855.0,783.0,708.0,690.0,678.0,638.0,540.0,452.0,437.0,452.0,492.0,496.0,434.0,452.0,454.0,503.0,545.0,541.0,526.0,520.0,576.0,742.0,840.0,872.0,806.0,753.0,692.0,671.0,0.0]}]}]}","_modifiedby_value":"42d582c5-4091-446c-a9ba-90e7f0a9bb9d","description":"Active Users","lookback":2,"isdefault":true,"isdrilldown":false,"_modifiedonbehalfby_value":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","name":"Active Users","metrictype":1,"parameters":"<Parameters><MetricIds><MetricId>C1BCC999-D150-4591-B0A5-0684A6A0F618</MetricId></MetricIds><DisplayOptions><ColorOptions><Colors>['#A83D1E']</Colors></ColorOptions></DisplayOptions></Parameters>","_createdby_value":"42d582c5-4091-446c-a9ba-90e7f0a9bb9d","_createdonbehalfby_value":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","plotoption":2,"savedorginsightsconfigurationid":"9725801d-0eaf-4100-891c-db34400ab102"
