# Create or edit a campaign template using in-app marketing (Sales)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

Save time when creating multiple campaigns by creating a campaign template. Campaign templates contain prefilled data that you specify, so you donâ€™t have to reenter the same information for each campaign. You can either create a new campaign template or copy an existing campaign to use as a template.  
  
## Create a campaign template  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_marketing_campaigns](../includes/proc-marketing-campaigns.md)]  
  
2. Click **New Template**.  
  
    \- OR -  
  
    Open the campaign you want to edit.  
  
3. Add information in the template form just as you do when creating a campaign. In the template form, enter the information you want to appear in campaigns based on this template, and add items such as planning tasks, campaign activities, and marketing lists.  
  
4. Click **Save** or **Save and Close**.  
  
## Copy an existing campaign as a template  
  
- Open the campaign that you want to copy. Click **Copy as Template**, type a name for the template, and click **Save**.  
  
  If you need to back up your templates, or use them in a different implementation of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)], you can export them as part of exporting customizations. More information: [Export your customizations as a solution](../customize/use-solutions-for-your-customizations.md)
