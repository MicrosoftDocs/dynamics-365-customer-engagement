# Manage instances

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

You manage your [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] instances from the [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-dyn-365-admin-center.md)].  

[!INCLUDE[cc-customer-engagement-apps-note](../includes/cc-customer-engagement-apps-note.md)] 

> [!NOTE]
> Consider using the less privileged service admin role instead of the global admin role. See [Use the service admin role to manage your tenant](use-service-admin-role-manage-tenant.md).
  
1.  Browse to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) and sign in using Global administrator credentials.  
  
2.  Choose **Admin** > **Dynamics 365**  
  
This section provides information on how you add or edit instances of a [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] apps subscription and set up additional non-Production (Sandbox) instances.
