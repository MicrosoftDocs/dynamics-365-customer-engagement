# Monitor email processing errors

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

[!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] generates alerts if errors occur while email is being processed. An error can be classified based on the nature of the error and on whether the error is for an email, a mailbox, or an email server profile.  

 The following table lists the distinction between permanent and transient errors.  

|Permanent Errors|Transient Errors|  
|----------------------|----------------------|  
|These are of permanent nature and can occur when the transient errors aren’t fixed after a few attempts.|These are of temporary nature and may get fixed automatically after a few attempts.|  
|When these errors occur, email processing for the affected mailboxes is stopped. These require a corrective action by the mailbox owner or a Dynamics 365 administrator.|These errors don’t necessarily require a corrective action by a Dynamics 365 user, but we recommend that you look at these.|  
|The administrators and users are alerted on their alert walls to take action and start email processing.|The administrators and users are notified on the alerts wall about these errors but no action is required for these errors.|  

 The following table will help you distinguish between email-level, mailbox-level, and email server profile-level errors and whether a corrective action is needed.  

|Email-level errors|Mailbox-level errors|Email server profile-level errors|  
|-------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|  
|These are errors specific to an email message.|These are error specific to a mailbox.|These errors may occur for one or more mailboxes.|  
|These don’t have impact on the processing of other email.|The owner of the mailbox is notified on the alerts wall and the owner is required to take a corrective action.|The owner of the associated email server profile is notified on the alerts wall and the owner is required to take a corrective action.|  
|The alerts for these are displayed in the alerts section of the email form.|The alert is also displayed in the respective mailbox form.|The owners of the mailbox that are affected are also notified on the alerts wall but no action is required by them.|  

## View alerts  
 The alerts are shown on the Alerts wall or the Alerts section in the mailbox or email server profile records. The following table shows how to view the alerts and the actions you can take on these alerts.
