# Create or edit business units to improve security and control

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

In [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)], a business unit is a logical grouping of related business activities.  
  
 If your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] organization is structured around departments or divisions that have separate products, customers, and marketing lists, you might want to create business units. Business units are mapped to an organization’s departments or divisions. Users can securely access data in their own business unit, but they can’t access data in other business units.  
  
 Business units, security roles, and users are linked together in a way that conforms to the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] role-based security model. Use business units together with security roles to control data access so people see just the information they need to do their jobs. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Security concepts for Microsoft Dynamics 365](../admin/security-concepts.md)  
  
 Keep the following in mind when creating business units:  
  
- The organization (also known as the root business unit) is the top level of a [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] business unit hierarchy. [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] automatically creates the organization when you install or provision [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. You can’t change or delete the organization name.  
  
- Each business unit can have just one parent business unit.  
  
- Each business unit can have multiple child business units.  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] security roles and users are associated with a business unit. You must assign every user to one (and only one) business unit.  
  
- You can assign a team to just one business unit, but a team can consist of users from one or many business units. Consider using a team if you have a situation where users from different business units need to work together on a shared set of records.

## Create a new business unit  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_security](../includes/proc-settings-security.md)]  
  
2. Choose **Business Units**.  
  
3. On the Actions bar, select **New**.  
  
4. In the **Business Unit** dialog box, type a name for the new business unit. [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] automatically fills in the **Parent Business** field with the name of the root business unit.

   -   Select an existing business unit from the list.  
  
   -   Create a new parent business unit:  
  
       1.  Choose **New**, and then add the information for the new parent business unit in the **Business Unit** dialog box.  
  
       2.  When you’re done adding information, select **Save and Close**.  
  
       3.  In the **Look Up Record** dialog box, select **Add**.

## Change the settings for a business unit  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_security](../includes/proc-settings-security.md)]  
  
2. Choose **Business Units** and then select a business unit name.  
  
3. In the **Business Unit** dialog box, do one or more of the following:  
  
   -   Modify the data in one or more fields.  
  
       > [!NOTE]
       >  You can’t change the name of a business unit or delete a business unit after it has been created. You can disable a business unit or change the parent, however. When you disable a business unit, all users and teams associated with the business unit are also disabled.  
  
   -   Make a selection on the **Actions** menu. For example, to change the parent business unit, select **Actions**, and then **Change Parent Business**.  
  
       > [!NOTE]
       >  Changing the parent business removes security roles for users and teams associated with the business unit. You must reassign them.  
  
   -   Select a record type under **Organization** to see a list of related records. For example, select **Users** to view a list of users in the selected business unit or to add a **New User** to the business unit.  
  
4. When you’re done making changes select **Save and Close**.

## Change the business unit for a record  
 You can change the business unit for an individual facility, equipment, or user. By changing the business unit for a user, you remove all security role assignments for the user. At least one security role must be assigned to the user in the new business unit.  More information: [Security roles](../admin/security-roles-privileges.md)

4. In the **Facility/Equipment** dialog box, on the **Actions** menu, choose **Change Business Unit**.  
  
5. In the **Change Business Unit** dialog box, use the **Lookup** button ![Lookup button](../admin/media/lookup-4.gif "Lookup button") to select a new business unit, and then select **OK**.  
  
6. Select **Save and Close**.
