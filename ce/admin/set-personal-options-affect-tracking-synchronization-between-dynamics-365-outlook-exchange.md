# Set personal options that affect tracking and synchronization between Dynamics 365 and Outlook or Exchange

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

You can use the **Set Personal Options** dialog box in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] to set many options that affect tracking and synchronization.  
  
 To open the **Set Personal Options** dialog box:  
  
- In [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], click the **Settings** button ![Options button for Dynamics 365](media/optionsbutton.png "Options button for Dynamics 365") in the upper-right corner of the screen, and then click **Options**.  
  
  The following table summarizes the tracking and synchronization options available in the **Set Personal Options** dialog box. The **Available** column indicates whether the option is available in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. This column also indicates if the option is available for [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] synchronization, server-side synchronization (also known as “[!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] synchronization”), or both.
