# Web application requirements

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

<a name="CRMappandMobileReqs"></a> This section lists the hardware and software requirements for the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_op_edition](../includes/pn-crm-onprem.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] web and mobile device client applications.  

<a name="webapp_hw_req"></a>   
## Dynamics 365 web application hardware requirements  
 The following table lists the minimum and recommended hardware requirements for the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] web application.  

|Component|Minimum|Recommended|  
|---------------|-------------|-----------------|  
|Processor|1.9 gigahertz (GHz)  x86- or x64-bit dual core processor with SSE2 instruction set|3.3 gigahertz (GHz) or faster 64-bit dual core processor with SSE2 instruction set|  
|Memory|2-GB RAM|4-GB RAM or more|  
|Display|Super VGA with a resolution of 1024 x 768|Super VGA with a resolution of 1024 x 768|  

 Running [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] on a computer that has less than the recommended requirements may result in inadequate performance. Additionally, satisfactory performance may be experienced running systems that use a different hardware configuration than those published here—for example, a system with a modern quad-core processor, lower clock speed, and more RAM.  

 **Network requirements**  

 [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] is designed to work best over networks that have the following elements:  

-   Bandwidth greater than 50 KBps (400 kbps)  

-   Latency under 150 ms  

Notice that these values are recommendations and don’t guarantee satisfactory performance. The recommended values are based on systems using out-of-the box forms that aren’t customized. If you significantly customize the out-of-box forms, we recommend that you test the form response to understand bandwidth needs. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Verify network capacity and throughput for Dynamics 365 clients](verify-network-capacity-throughput-clients.md)  

### Network requirements when you use Dynamics 365 interactive service hub experience  
 The [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] interactive service hub experience is designed to work best over networks that have the following elements:  

-   Bandwidth greater than 1Megabit per second (125 KBps/Kilobyte per second)  

-   Latency under 150 ms  

Notice that the suggested network requirements include the metadata download needed for first run or newly published customizations. The [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] interactive service hub typically requires more bandwidth when metadata has to be downloaded. These values are recommendations and don’t guarantee satisfactory performance. The values are based on systems using uncustomized, out-of-the box forms. If you significantly customize the out-of-box forms, we recommend that you test the form response to understand bandwidth needs.
