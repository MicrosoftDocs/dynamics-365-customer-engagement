This section describes how to integrate [!INCLUDE[pn_MicrosoftCognitiveServices_full](../includes/pn-microsoftcognitiveservices-full.md)] with [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] features, such as similar cases and suggest knowledge articles.  


> [!IMPORTANT]
> - [!INCLUDE[pn_CognitiveServices_short](../includes/pn-microsoftcognitiveservices-short.md)] integration with [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] is only available for instances in the United States (US) region.

## About Microsoft Cognitive Services  
[!INCLUDE[pn_MicrosoftCognitiveServices_full](../includes/pn-microsoftcognitiveservices-full.md)] includes several APIs that leverage the power of machine learning. Some [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] features can use the Text Analytics APIs to detect sentiment, key phrases, topics, and language from the text found in your [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] data.   

<a name="Set_AzureMLconnection"></a>   

## Set the text analytics connection  
[!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] features that  use the [!INCLUDE[pn_CognitiveServices_short](../includes/pn-microsoftcognitiveservices-short.md)] Text Analytics service for keyword matching, like [!INCLUDE[cc_Document_Suggestions](../includes/cc-document-suggestions.md)], similar cases, and knowledge article suggestions, require a [!INCLUDE[pn_CognitiveServices_short](../includes/pn-microsoftcognitiveservices-short.md)] Text Analytics service connection. This connects [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] to the [!INCLUDE[pn_CognitiveServices_short](../includes/pn-microsoftcognitiveservices-short.md)] Text Analytics service.  

1. Go to **Settings** > **Administration** > **Azure Text Analytics Service Configuration**.  

2. Review the information and click **Continue**.  

3. Next, fill in the connection information.

4. Click **Test Connection** to validate your settings.  

5. Once the connection is successful, click **Activate**.  


<a name="create_similar_record_rules"></a>   
## Create similar record suggestion rules  
 Set up automatic suggestion of similar records by creating rules. The rules you create can use either [!INCLUDE[pn_CognitiveServices_short](../includes/pn-microsoftcognitiveservices-short.md)] Text Analytics or some features let you use the built-in similarities matching  engine in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]. Notice that you can only create one similar records suggestions rule for each entity type.  

1. Go to **Settings** > **Data Management** > **Similar Records Suggestions Settings**.  

2. Click **New**.  

3. Fill in the fields on the New Advanced Similarity Rule dialog.

4. Click **Save**.  

5. For opportunity similarity rules, notice that sample mappings are already added. To add a mapping, scroll down to **Match Fields**, and then click New (![Add button](../admin/media/nb-ua-r1-plus.png "Add button")).  

6. In the New Text Analytics page, enter values for the following fields. These values are used to determine the keywords or key phrases from source records using text analytics to match with target records using text search. This helps to achieve keyword-based similarity between source and target records.

7. Click **Save**.  

8. Click **Activate**.  

9. Add more mappings to create a comprehensive search of related records.  

<a name="EnableFieldExactMatch"></a>   
### Enable a field for exact matching of similar records  
 To enable a field for exact match, add the field in the Quick find view of the corresponding entity.  

1.  Go to **Settings** > **Customizations** > **Customize the System**.  

2.  Expand **Entities**, expand the entity that you want to enable exact matching, such as the Account entity, and then click **Views**.  

3.  Click **Quick Find Active Accounts**, click **More Actions**, and then click **Edit**.  

4.  Under Common Tasks, click **Add Find Columns**, and then select the field that you want to enable exact matching.  

5.  Click **OK**, and then click **Save and Close** on the Quick Find Active Accounts page.  

6.  Because adding a field to a view  is a customization, you must publish the customization to enable exact matching for the field. To do this, in the left navigation pane click the entity, such as Account, and then click **Publish**. To publish all customizations, click **Publish All Customizations**.
