# Save time creating a security role by copying one

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

If you want to create a security role that is similar to another security role, you can copy an existing security role and save it with a new name. You can then modify the privileges and access levels to accommodate the new security role.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> - You canâ€™t copy a security role to a different business unit.  
> - Security role privileges are subject to change with updates and the copied security role could become out-of-date. You should periodically check security role privileges. See [Create an administrative user and prevent elevation of security role privilege](prevent-elevation-security-role-privilege.md) for an alternative method to assign security role privileges that will change dynamically.
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_permissions_system_admin_and_customizer](../includes/proc-permissions-system-admin-and-customizer.md)]  
  
    Check your security role  
  
    - [!INCLUDE[proc_check_your_security_role](../includes/proc-check-your-security-role.md)]  
  
    - [!INCLUDE[proc_dont_have_correct_permissions](../includes/proc-dont-have-correct-permissions.md)]  
  
2. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_security](../includes/proc-settings-security.md)]  
  
3.  Click **Security Roles**.  
  
4.  In the list of security roles, under **Name**, click or tap to select the security role you want to copy, and then on the Actions toolbar, click or tap **More Actions** > **Copy Role**.  
  
5.  In the **Copy Security Role** dialog box, in the **New Role Name** text box, type in the name for the new security role.  
  
6.  To modify the new security role after creating a copy, verify that the **Open the new security role when copying is complete** check box is selected; otherwise, clear the check box.  
  
7.  Click **OK**.
