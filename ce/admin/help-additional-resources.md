## Security and service continuity  

 When a business allows an external service provider to store and manage its data, key considerations must include security, data protection, privacy, and data ownership. [!INCLUDE[cc_Microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] takes these concerns seriously and has applied its years of cloud and on-premises experience with security and privacy to delivery of the [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] service. This focus is highlighted by the 99.9% uptime provision of the service-level agreement (SLA).
