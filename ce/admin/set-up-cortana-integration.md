# Preview feature: Set up Cortana integration

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We are working to deliver a robust and scalable digital assistant experience across all of our Dynamics 365 offerings. This includes natural language integration for customers and partners across multiple channels including [!INCLUDE[pn_cortana](../includes/pn-cortana.md)]. To that end, we are discontinuing the current [!INCLUDE[pn_cortana](../includes/pn-cortana.md)] integration preview feature that was made available for Dynamics 365 and we are focusing on building a new long term intelligent solution experience, which will include [!INCLUDE[pn_cortana](../includes/pn-cortana.md)] digital assistant integration.
  
We’re introducing [!INCLUDE[pn_cortana](../includes/pn-cortana.md)] integration to help salespeople keep track of important [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] activities. [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_2016_update_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-2016-update-shortest.md)] embeds sales activities, accounts, and opportunities into [!INCLUDE[pn_cortana](../includes/pn-cortana.md)] to surface what’s most relevant to salespeople at any time.  
  
 Cortana integration is available as a Preview feature to organizations that use [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_2016_update_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-2016-update-shortest.md)]. [!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_expect_changes](../includes/cc-preview-features-expect-changes.md)]
