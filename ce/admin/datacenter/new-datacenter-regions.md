# Datacenter regions

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

[!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] is being hosted in datacenters in more and more regions. After [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] becomes available in a new region, the following apply:  
  
-   For new [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] organizations, the datacenter will be aligned with the country/region you selected during sign-up.  
  
-   For existing [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] organizations, [!INCLUDE[cc_Microsoft](../../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] will soon accommodate migrations to datacenters in the new region when requested by the customer as long as the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] organization meets certain business requirements.  
  
The following table lists the newest datacenter regions. The [datacenter maps](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=522460) show all the regions. Or use the interactive data map: [Where is my data?](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=401277)
