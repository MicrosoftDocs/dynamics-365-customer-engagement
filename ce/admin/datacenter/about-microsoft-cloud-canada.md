# About the Microsoft Cloud Canada datacenter

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

## New Microsoft Cloud Services in Canada  
  
### What is Microsoft announcing?  
 We’re announcing the general availability of [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] served from new datacenter regions in Toronto and Quebec City, joining [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Azure](../../includes/pn-windows-azure.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../../includes/pn-office-365.md)] in providing the trusted [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_cloud](../../includes/pn-microsoft-cloud.md)] in Canada.  
  
 Built on foundational principles of security, privacy and control, compliance, and transparency, the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_cloud](../../includes/pn-microsoft-cloud.md)] delivers trusted cloud services to enable people and organizations to achieve more. Providing flexible platform and productivity solutions - [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Azure](../../includes/pn-windows-azure.md)], [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../../includes/pn-office-365.md)], and now [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] - the local [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_cloud](../../includes/pn-microsoft-cloud.md)] is designed to fuel innovation and accelerate Canada’s digital transformation.  
  
### What is the benefit to customers?  
 The new local [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_cloud](../../includes/pn-microsoft-cloud.md)] enables data residency for customers in Canada, bringing enterprise-grade reliability and performance to regulated industries and other businesses. This includes data replication in multiple regions within Canada for business continuity, reduced network distance, and the option of a private connection to the cloud with [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_expressroute](../../includes/pn-azure-expressroute.md)]. The [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_cloud](../../includes/pn-microsoft-cloud.md)] in Canada comes with the same deep commitment to high availability as our other regions, including a financially backed service level agreement of 99.9%.  
  
 For [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)], data residency means that most customer data will be kept within Canada, except for [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_active_directory](../../includes/pn-azure-active-directory.md)] data. For the definition of customer data and details on our data flow maps in Geo, see the [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Trust Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=393409).  
  
### Where are the Microsoft Cloud Canada regions?  
 The [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] Canada Geo will consist of datacenters in Toronto and Quebec City.  
  
### How do I find what country or region my account is under?  
  
1. Sign in to [https://portal.office.com](https://portal.office.com).  
  
2. In the upper-right corner of the [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../../includes/pn-office-365.md)] admin center menu bar, click your organization.  
  
   ![Choose your organization](../../admin/media/data-center-choose-organization.png "Choose your organization")  
  
3. On the **Company profile** page, your account country/region is listed under **Country or region**.

## Dynamics 365 (online) service overview  
  
### Will multi-geo instances be available to customers in Canada?  
 Yes, multi-geo instances will be supported for Canada. Multi-geo instances are designed for companies with offices in multiple countries or regions who want to keep core customer data within those countries or regions. Availability of multi-geo instance support will be limited in the initial rollout to a fixed number of eligible customers. We'll continue to expand this capacity over time.  [Read more on how to create and edit multi-geo instances](../../admin/add-edit-multiregional-instances.md).  
  
### Will the standard Dynamics 365 Online service level agreements be offered?  
 Yes, the standard [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] service level agreements (SLAs) will apply to the Canada regions, just as they do in our other regions around the world.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The SLA for [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] doesn't cover [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../../includes/pn-social-engagement-long.md)].  
  
### Will Microsoft Dynamics Marketing, Social Engagement, and Parature be available in the Canada datacenters?  
 These services are available for purchase in Canada, however, these services are provisioned regionally at this time.  
  
### What is the customer experience if I use both Dynamics CRM Online from the Canada regions while using Microsoft Dynamics Marketing, Microsoft Social Engagement, and Parature from other regions?  
 The customer experience will be unchanged, the workloads for the other services will simply be provisioned from other regions.  
  
### When will ExpressRoute be available in Canada for Dynamics 365 Online customers, and through which partners?  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_expressroute](../../includes/pn-expressroute.md)] is currently available in Canada. [View a current list of ExpressRoute locations and partners](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/expressroute-locations/). [!INCLUDE[cc_Microsoft](../../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] is currently working to enable customers to use [!INCLUDE[pn_expressroute](../../includes/pn-expressroute.md)] with [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] from the Canada regions.  
  
### Where can I find more about Microsoft Dynamics 365 (online) security, data privacy, and compliance?  
 You can find more information at the  [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Trust Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=393409).  
  
### Where can I find out more about the physical infrastructure for Dynamics 365 (online)?  
 These services are hosted in the Microsoft cloud infrastructure comprising more than 100 globally distributed datacenters, edge computing nodes, and service operations centers. This infrastructure is supported by one of the world’s largest multi-terabit global networks, with an extensive dark fiber footprint that connects them all.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[cc_Microsoft](../../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] provides cloud services to customers 24x7x365, and the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_cloud](../../includes/pn-microsoft-cloud.md)] Infrastructure and Operations team designs, builds, operates and helps secure every facet of the infrastructure. Since opening our first datacenter in 1989, we’ve invested more than $15 billion on our infrastructure and remain focused on delivering reliable, scalable, and secure online services.  
  
<a name="BKMK_Migration"></a>   
## Migration  
 You may request migration to the Canada datacenter by submitting a technical support request.  If you’re an existing [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] customer with a billing address mapping to Canada, review the information in this topic to understand the move process.  
  
<a name="BKMK_RequestMove"></a>   
### How do I request my instance to be moved to Canada?  
 You can request a move to the new Canada datacenter by submitting a technical support request through the [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_admin_center](../../includes/pn-dyn-365-admin-center.md)] or by calling [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Support](../../includes/pn-microsoft-support.md)]. Please select the Data Management topic and Data Center Migration Request sub-topic to ensure your request receives the best possible routing.  A [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] support engineer will assist you in verifying required prerequisites and provide guidance throughout the move process.  
  
 ![Migration Process](../../admin/media/migration-process.png "Migration Process")  
  
 *Customers will be required to go through more steps depending on the type of transition.  
  
### How will Microsoft engage with me on the migration?  
 Once you have been scheduled for migration, a member of the [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Support](../../includes/pn-microsoft-support.md)] team will work directly with you to discuss scheduling and any other issues that may come up during the migration.  
  
### If I am scheduled for an update to CRM Online 2015 Update or CRM Online 2015 Update 1, will Microsoft apply the update at the same time as their migration to the Canada datacenter?  
 You must be updated to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_2015_update](../../includes/pn-crm-online-2015-update.md)] or later prior to migrating to the Canada datacenter.  Customers can schedule their update. For more information, see [Manage Dynamics 365 (online) updates](../../admin/manage-updates.md).  
  
### If I have both Office 365 services and Dynamics 365 (online), how will migration be handled?  
 The migration of each service will be handled separately. For [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)], you’ll be able to choose their migration date and time. [!INCLUDE[cc_Microsoft](../../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] will work with you to schedule the migration. For [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../../includes/pn-office-365.md)] scheduling and migration, see [New datacenter regions for Office 365](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn878163.aspx).  
  
### Can I move Office 365 and Dynamics 365 (online) at the same time?  
 The move process for each service is handled separately. The [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] move can be requested to coincide with the [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_admin_center](../../includes/pn-office-365-admin-center.md)] move.  
  
### If my content is stored in the Canada datacenters, can I access my content for work from locations outside of Canada?  
 Yes. If you're outside of Canada and sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] as an authenticated user, you'll be able to access the relevant data.  
  
<a name="BKMK_Licensing"></a>   
## Licensing and pricing  
  
### Will all versions of Dynamics 365 (online) be available?  
 Customers will be able to purchase all licenses that are currently available in the market today. Please see local availability at [Microsoft Dynamics CRM Solutions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/dynamics/crm-purchase-online.aspx). Global pricing can be found at [Microsoft Dynamics Pricing List](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=401462).  
  
### How will a customer who has an existing volume license agreement outside of Canada be billed if they add a new tenant to their agreement that resides in Canada?  
 The additional seats will be invoiced at the same rate on the customer’s invoice. The business desk will need to provide a multi-tenant amendment to provide an additional tenant in Canada.  
  
### If I started a trial outside of Canada and before general availability, will I be moved to the Canada datacenter after general availability?  
 No. Trials will remain in the geography where they were initiated. You may choose to start a new trial that will provision in the Canada datacenter.  
  
### If I choose to convert a trial to a paid subscription, where the trial was created in a geographic region outside of Canada prior to general availability, will my subscription tenant and instance be moved to the Canada datacenter?  
 No. If you choose to convert a trial that was created in a geographic region outside of Canada before general availability, your trial will be converted and billed in the geography where it was initiated. If the trial was originally deployed in Canada and converted to a paid subscription, it will continue to be deployed in Canada.  
  
### If a customer creates a trial in the Canada datacenter after general availability, will they be taxed for the trial?  
 No. Trials are free for 30 days.
