If you select this option, the credentials specified in the email server profile are used for sending or receiving email for the mailboxes of all users and queues associated with this profile. The credentials must have impersonation or delegation permissions on the mailboxes associated with profile. This option requires some configuration on the email server, for example, configuring impersonation rights on [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] for the mailboxes associated with the profile. **Note:**      To ensure the credentials are secured in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)], SQL encryption is used to encrypt the credentials stored in the email server profile if you’re processing email by using server-side synchronization.<br />- **Windows Integrated Authentication**.

The default value of this field is 10. The maximum number is considered per mailbox or per email server profile depending on whether the credentials are specified in a mailbox or email server profile.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |


4. Choose **Save**.  

<a name="BKMK_ConfigureDefault"></a>   
## Configure default email processing and synchronization  
 Set server-side synchronization to be the default configuration method.  

1. Go to **Settings** > **Email Configuration** > **Email Configuration Settings**.  

2. Set the processing and synchronization fields as follows:  

   - **Server Profile**: The profile you created in the above section.  

   - **Incoming Email**: Server-Side Synchronization or Email Router  

   - **Outgoing Email**: Server-Side Synchronization or Email Router  

   - **Appointments, Contacts, and Tasks**: Server-Side Synchronization or Email Router  

       > [!NOTE]
       >  Server-Side Synchronization or Email Router for Appointments, Contacts, and Tasks is not supported for the POP3-SMTP profile.  

     If you leave the **Email processing form unapproved user and queues** at the default values (checked), you will need to approve emails and queues for user mailboxes as directed below in **Approve Email**.  


 ![System Settings for server-side synchronization](../admin/media/crm-itpro-exchangeonlinessssettingspop.png "System Settings for server-side synchronization")  


3.  Click **OK**.  

<a name="BKMK_ConfigureMailboxes"></a>   
## Configure mailboxes  
 To set mailboxes to use the default profile, you must first set the Server Profile and the delivery method for email, appointments, contacts, and tasks.  

 In addition to administrator permissions, you must have Read and Write privileges on the Mailbox entity to set the delivery method for the mailbox.  

 Click **one** of the following methods:  

#### Set mailboxes to the default profile  

1. Go to **Settings** > **Email Configuration** > **Mailboxes**.  

2. Choose **Active Mailboxes**.  

3. Select all the mailboxes that you want to associate with the POP3-SMTP profile you created, click **Apply Default Email Settings**, verify the settings, and then click **OK**.  

   ![Apply default email settings](../admin/media/apply-default-email-settings.png "Apply default email settings")  

    By default, the mailbox configuration is tested and the mailboxes are enabled when you click **OK**.  

#### Edit mailboxes to set the profile and delivery methods  

1.  Go to **Settings** > **Email Configuration** > **Mailboxes**.  

2.  Click **Active Mailboxes**.  

3.  Select the mailboxes that you want to configure, and then click **Edit**.  

4.  In the **Change Multiple Records** form, under **Synchronization Method**, set **Server Profile** to the POP3-SMTP profile you created earlier.  

5.  Set **Incoming** and **Outgoing** **Email** to **Server-Side Synchronization or Email Router**.  

6.  Set **Appointments, Contacts, and Tasks** to **None**.  


7.  Click **Change**.  

<a name="BKMK_ApproveEmail"></a>   
## Approve email  
 You need to approve each user mailbox or queue before that mailbox can process email.  

1.  Go to **Settings** > **Email Configuration** > **Mailboxes**.  

2.  Click **Active Mailboxes**.  

3.  Select the mailboxes that you want to approve, and then click **More Commands** (**…**) > **Approve Email**.  

4.  Click **OK**.  

<a name="BKMK_TestConfiguration"></a>   
## Test configuration of mailboxes  

1. Go to **Settings** > **Email Configuration** > **Mailboxes**.  

2. Click **Active Mailboxes**.  

3. Select the mailboxes you want to test, and then click **Test & Enable Mailboxes**.  

    This tests the incoming and outgoing email configuration of the selected mailboxes and enables them for email processing. If an error occurs in a mailbox, an alert is shown on the Alerts wall of the mailbox and the profile owner. Depending on the nature of the error, [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] tries to process the email again after some time or disables the mailbox for email processing.  

    The result of the email configuration test is displayed in the **Incoming Email Status**, **Outgoing Email Status**, and **Appointments, Contacts, and Tasks Status** fields of a mailbox record. An alert is also generated when the configuration is successfully completed for a mailbox. This alert is shown to the mailbox owner.  

    You can find information on recurring issues and other troubleshooting information in [Blog: Test and Enable Mailboxes in Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2015](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/crm/archive/2015/08/31/test-and-enable-mailboxes-in-microsoft-dynamics-crm-2015.aspx) and [Troubleshooting and monitoring server-side synchronization](troubleshooting-monitoring-server-side-synchronization.md).  

> [!TIP]
>  If you’re unable to synchronize contacts, appointments, and tasks for a mailbox, you may want to select the **Sync items with Exchange from this Dynamics 365 org only, even if Exchange was set to sync with a different org** check box.

## Test email configuration for all mailboxes associated with an email server profile  

1. Go to **Settings** > **Email Configuration** > **Email Server Profiles**.  

2. Select the profile you created, and then click **Test & Enable Mailboxes**.  

    When you test the email configuration, an asynchronous job runs in the background. It may take a few minutes for the test to be completed. [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] tests the email configuration of all the mailboxes associated with the POP3-SMTP profile. For the mailboxes configured with server-side synchronization for synchronizing appointments, tasks, and contacts, it also checks to make sure they’re configured properly.
