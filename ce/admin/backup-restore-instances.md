# Backup and restore instances

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

Protecting your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] data and providing continuous availability of service is important for you and for us. You have multiple options for backing up and restoring your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] instances.

## Daily system backups  
 Good news! Some backups take place without you having to do anything.  
  
 About [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] **system backups**:  
  
- All your instances are backed up.  
  
- System backups occur daily.  
  
- System backups are retained up to three days. Check your expiration date.  

  ![Expires On column that shows the expiration dates for backups](media/Expires66.png "Expires On column that shows the expiration dates for backups")

- System backups do not count against your storage limits.  
  
- System backups are identified as created by **System** on the **Manage backups** page.

## On-demand backup: Dynamics 365 managed  
 Automated system backups are great, but you will want to be able to make your own backups before making some significant customization change or applying a version update. You can do this with on-demand [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] managed  backups.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  A backup is created for you when we update your instance.  
  
 About [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] managed **on-demand backups**:  
  
- You can back up Production and Sandbox instances.  
  
- **You can only restore to a Sandbox instance**. To restore to a Production instance, first switch it to a Sandbox instance. See [Switch an instance](../admin/switch-instance.md).  
  
- Only [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_8_1_0_online_subsequent](../includes/pn-crm-8-1-0-online-subsequent.md)] or later versions are supported for backup.  
  
- On-demand backups are retained for up to three days. Check your expiration date.  
  
  ![On-demand backup expiration date](../admin/media/on-demand-backup-expiration-date.png "On-demand backup expiration date")  
  
- You are not limited in the number of on-demand backups you can make.

- On-demand backups do not count against your storage limits.  

- On-demand backups are identified by having a label you created and by the presence of **Edit** | **Delete** | **Restore** in the details section. System backups have only **Restore**.
