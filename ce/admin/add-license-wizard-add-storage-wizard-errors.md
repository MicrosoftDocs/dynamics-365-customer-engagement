# Fixing Add License Wizard and Add Storage Wizard errors

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

You may see an error while running the Add User License Wizard if you have:  
  
- Reached the maximum number of licenses available for your offer.  
  
- Attempted to remove licenses, which would result in less than the minimum number of licenses required by your offer.  
  
  > [!IMPORTANT]
  >  To see other offers available to you, on the **Subscription Management** page, under **Application Usage**, click or tap **View Offers**. If you are eligible to change your current offer, the offers will be listed. If you are not eligible for an offer at this time, contact the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] sales team.  
  
You may see an error while running the Add Storage Wizard if you have:  
  
-   Reached the storage limit available for your offer.  
  
-   The minimum amount of storage for that offer.  
  
If you cannot add storage from your [!INCLUDE[pn_Online_Subscription](../includes/pn-online-subscription.md)], it might be that your current offer has a limited amount of storage available.
