# Enable OneDrive for Business (online)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

This feature was introduced in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_2016_update_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-2016-update-shortest.md)].  
  
 Users can create and manage private documents with [!INCLUDE[pn_onedrive_for_business](../includes/pn-onedrive-for-business.md)]. Those documents can be accessed in [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] after the system administrator has enabled [!INCLUDE[pn_onedrive_for_business](../includes/pn-onedrive-for-business.md)].  
  
## Requirements  

> [!NOTE]
>  This topic applies to organizations deploying online versions of [!INCLUDE[pn_onedrive_for_business](../includes/pn-onedrive-for-business.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. For information on integrating [!INCLUDE[pn_onedrive_for_business](../includes/pn-onedrive-for-business.md)] on-premises with Dynamics 365, or an online/on-premises mix of these products, see: [Enable OneDrive for Business (on-premises)](../admin/connect-onedrive-business.md).  

 The following are required to use [!INCLUDE[pn_onedrive_for_business](../includes/pn-onedrive-for-business.md)] with [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)]:  
  
- [Configure server-based authentication with Dynamics 365 (online) and SharePoint Online](configure-server-based-authentication-sharepoint-online.md).  
  
- A [!INCLUDE[pn_onedrive_for_business](../includes/pn-onedrive-for-business.md)] license for each user. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [What is OneDrive for Business?](https://support.office.com/article/What-is-OneDrive-for-Business-187f90af-056f-47c0-9656-cc0ddca7fdc2)  
  
- A [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] license for each user. Users with a [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] license can use [!INCLUDE[pn_onedrive_for_business](../includes/pn-onedrive-for-business.md)].
