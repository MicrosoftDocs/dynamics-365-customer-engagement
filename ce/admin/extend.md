[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc_applies_to_on-prem-9_0_0](../includes/cc_applies_to_on-prem-9_0_0.md)]

1. Integrating Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps with your email system such as Exchange Online or Gmail.
2. Adding solutions by Microsoft like Office 365 Groups or solutions from other companies.
3. Integrating with Office 365 features such as SharePoint, Skype, OneDrive, or OneNote.
