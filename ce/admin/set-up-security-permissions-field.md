# Set up security permissions for a field 

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

You can restrict access to a field by creating a field security profile. After you create the profile, you assign users and or teams to that profile, and set up specific read, create, or write permissions for the field.
