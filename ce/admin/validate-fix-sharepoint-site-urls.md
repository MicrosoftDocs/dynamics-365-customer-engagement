# Validate and fix SharePoint site URLs

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

In [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)], [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] site and document location records contain links to site collections, site, document libraries, and folders in [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)]. These site and document location records are associated with [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] records so that the documents for [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] records can be stored in [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)].  
  
 When the links between [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] break, you must validate and fix the links so that the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] records continue to point to the correct document libraries and folders for managing the documents.  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_permissions_system_admin](../includes/proc-permissions-system-admin.md)]  
  
    Check your security role  
  
   - [!INCLUDE[proc_check_your_security_role](../includes/proc-check-your-security-role.md)]  
  
   - [!INCLUDE[proc_dont_have_correct_permissions](../includes/proc-dont-have-correct-permissions.md)]  
  
2. Find and fix the URLs. To do this, follow these steps.  
  
   1. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_doc_mgmt](../includes/proc-settings-doc-mgmt.md)]  
  
   2. Click **[!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] Sites**.  
  
   3. Select the site URLs that you want to validate, and then click or tap **Validate**.  
  
3. [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] validates all the selected site URLs and their immediate subordinate site and document library URLs. It then displays the results in **Validating Sites**.  
  
4. To fix a URL, open the site record, and enter the correct URL. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Create or edit site records](edit-existing-sharepoint-site-records.md).  
  
5. Click **Save & Close**.
