# SharePoint Document Management software requirements

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

If you want to use [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_SharePoint_long](../includes/pn-ms-sharepoint-long.md)] document management functionality with [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] , you must meet the requirements listed in this topic.  

<a name="docman_online"></a>   
## Use document management in Dynamics 365 (online)  
 If you are using server-based integration with [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)], you can use [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_sharepoint_online](../includes/pn-microsoft-sharepoint-online.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_sharepoint_2013](../includes/pn-microsoft-sharepoint-2013.md)] SP1 on-premises (or a later version).  

 If you are using the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_2016_list_component_sharepoint](../includes/pn-crm-2016-list-component-sharepoint.md)], one of the following versions of [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_SharePoint_long](../includes/pn-ms-sharepoint-long.md)] must be available:  

- [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_sharepoint_2013](../includes/pn-microsoft-sharepoint-2013.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_sharepoint_2013](../includes/pn-microsoft-sharepoint-2013.md)] SP1  

- [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_SharePoint_2010](../includes/pn-microsoft-sharepoint-2010.md)] SP1 or SP2  

- [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_sharepoint_online](../includes/pn-microsoft-sharepoint-online.md)]  

**A SharePoint site collection**. You also need to have at least one site collection configured and available for [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].  

Either **Server-based [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration** (recommended) or **[!INCLUDE[pn_list_component_short](../includes/pn-list-component-short.md)]** must be enabled.  

The list component, which is a [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] solution, is not required if you use server-based [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration. Although the [!INCLUDE[pn_list_component_short](../includes/pn-list-component-short.md)] is the default document management configuration option, we recommend you enable server-based [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Server-based SharePoint integration](../admin/sharepoint-document-management-software-requirements.md#BKMK_enable_servertoserver)  

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The document management feature requires that [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_sharepoint_online](../includes/pn-sharepoint-online.md)] subscriptions be under the same tenant.  
> 
> [!INCLUDE[pn_sharepoint_foundation](../includes/pn-sharepoint-foundation.md)] versions aren’t compatible with [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] document management.  

 Users who access [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] from [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] must have appropriate permissions on the [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] site collection where the document management components are installed. For more information about how to grant membership on a site collection, see the [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] Help.  

<a name="BKMK_enable_servertoserver"></a>   

## Server-based SharePoint integration  
 Earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] document management use a client-to-server strategy to authenticate and transmit data from [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] to [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)]. Server-based (using server-to-server authentication) [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration provides the following benefits:  

- User interface that is consistent with the newly-updated [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] user interface.  

- To configure and use document management, you do not need to be signed in to both [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)].  

- You no longer need to install or continue to use the [!INCLUDE[pn_list_component_short](../includes/pn-list-component-short.md)] solution. Note that client-to-server authentication strategies that require [!INCLUDE[pn_sharepoint_online](../includes/pn-sharepoint-online.md)] server sandboxing may be deprecated soon. This functionality is required by the [!INCLUDE[pn_list_component_short](../includes/pn-list-component-short.md)].  

**[!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] authentication method support**

> [!NOTE]
>  You can create and view folders when using the [!INCLUDE[pn_list_component_short](../includes/pn-list-component-short.md)]. This is not available in server-based [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration.  

 For information about how to enable server-based [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration, see [Set up SharePoint integration with Dynamics 365](../admin/set-up-sharepoint-integration.md).  

 For more information about the [!INCLUDE[pn_list_component_short](../includes/pn-list-component-short.md)], see [Dynamics CRM List Component for SharePoint](../admin/sharepoint-document-management-software-requirements.md#BKMK_listComp).  

<a name="BKMK_listComp"></a>   
## Dynamics CRM List Component for SharePoint  
 The [!INCLUDE[pn_list_component_short](../includes/pn-list-component-short.md)] makes [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] documents that are stored on [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] available to you in a format that has the look and feel of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]. This feature also lets [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] automatically create folders that will be used to store documents related to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] records on [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)].  

 The [!INCLUDE[pn_list_component_short](../includes/pn-list-component-short.md)] has the following benefits:  

- Users can create and view folders when using document management within [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].  

- Users can create [custom content types](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=396378) such as a Sales Contract content type.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Notice that the [!INCLUDE[pn_list_component_short](../includes/pn-list-component-short.md)] isn’t required when you use server-based integration with [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)]. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Server-based SharePoint integration](../admin/sharepoint-document-management-software-requirements.md#BKMK_enable_servertoserver)  
> - Cient-to-server authentication strategies that require [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] server sandboxing, like those used with the [!INCLUDE[pn_list_component_short](../includes/pn-list-component-short.md)],  may be deprecated soon.
