# Extend Universal Resource Scheduling actions to use your preferred geospatial data provider (Field Service, Project Service Automation)

[!INCLUDE[](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

You can create a *custom* plug-in and register on the Universal Resource Scheduling actions that provide geospatial functionality to use data from a data provider of your choice instead of the default Bing Maps API.

The following Universal Resource Scheduling [actions](../../customize/actions.md) provide geospatial functionality in [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_field_service](../../includes/pn-dyn-365-field-service.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_project_service_auto](../../includes/pn-dyn-365-project-service-auto.md)]:
- **msdyn_GeocodeAddress** for geocoding addresses
- **msdyn_RetrieveDistanceMatrix** for calculating travel times and distances between two locations. 

The [!INCLUDE[pn_field_service](../../includes/pn-field-service.md)] and Project Service Automation solutions contain a plug-in registered on these two actions that, *by default*, uses the data provided by Bing Maps API to perform geospatial operations.
