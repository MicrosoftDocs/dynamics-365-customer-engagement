# Overview of guidance content

We have identified common issues that can occur if best practices are not followed when you are customizing, extending, or integrating with the platform. This section provides you a centralized location to learn about the issues we have identified, their impact, and understand the guidance to resolve them. You will have some background about why things should be done in a certain way and avoid potential problems in the future. This can benefit the usability, supportability, and performance of your environment.  The guidance documentation supports the existing information within the SDK and the Developer and Administration guides.
