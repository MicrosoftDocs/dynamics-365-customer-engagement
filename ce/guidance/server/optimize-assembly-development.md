# Optimize assembly development


**Category**: Performance, Maintainability, Design

**Impact potential**: Low

<a name='symptoms'></a>

## Symptoms

When developing assemblies for Dynamics 365, there are a couple of considerations to take in:

1. Multiple different assemblies
    - Increased maintainability complexity
    - Potential increase plug-in execution length

2. Sandbox assembly size constraint is 16 MB in Dynamics 365 (online) and, by default, 8 MB in Dynamics 365 (on-premises).

## Guidance

> [!NOTE]
> Further Guidance clarification is under development regarding specific details in optimizing assembly development, such as, how to merge separate plug-ins into a single assembly and suggestions to minimize the assembly size.

### Consolidate Plug-ins or Custom Workflow Activities into a Single Assembly

Plug-ins and custom workflow activities developed for a Dynamics 365 solution should exist with others in a single Visual Studio project. Consider merging separate plug-ins/custom workflow activities into a single Visual Studio project/assembly unless the plug-ins fall into the following exceptions:

1. A plug-in/custom workflow activity needs to be selectively deployed to one environment but not to others.

2. The physical assembly size is near or greater than 16 MB for a Dynamics 365 (online) instance or, by default, 8 MB in Dynamics 365 (on-premises).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Dynamics 365 (on-premises) deployments can identify the assembly size constraint by executing the following SQL query
>```sql
    USE MSCRM_CONFIG
    SELECT ColumnName, IntColumn FROM DeploymentProperties
    WHERE ColumnName = 'SandboxClientMaxAssemblySizeInKByte'
>```

### Move Plug-ins/Custom Workflow Activities into Multiple Assemblies

Dynamics 365 (online) has an assembly size constraint of 16 MB which cannot be changed. If your assembly size is nearing 16 MB, consider moving plug-in/custom workflow activities into multiple assemblies.

## Problematic patterns

### Multiple assemblies
Having multiple assemblies has a couple of areas that can be impacted:

1. Performance - each assembly has a lifecycle that is managed by the Dynamics 365 service.  This includes loading, caching, and unloading the assemblies.  Having more than one assembly causes more work to be done on the server, loading and caching an assembly, and could affect the overall plug-in/custom workflow activity execution length.

2. Maintainability - having more than one plug-in/custom workflow activity Visual Studio project leads to more complex application lifecycle management (ALM). It increases the risk and the amount of time when updating/patching the appropriate project for a specific plug-in/custom workflow activity, packaging the plug-ins/custom workflow activities within a solution, and managing plug-ins/custom workflow activities within a deployment.

### Assembly larger than 16 MB
You will not be able to register an assembly within Dynamics 365 (online) that is larger than 16 MB.

## Additional information

Quite often, Dynamics 365 developers create a new Visual Studio project for each plug-in/custom workflow activity.  In turn, this causes a separate assembly to be generated for each plug-in/custom workflow activity.
