# Enable or disable Microsoft Teams chat in Dynamics 365

You can configure the ability for sellers and agents to chat in Microsoft Teams from within the customer engagement apps such as Sales Hub, Customer Service Hub, and custom apps. This helps in effective collaboration on the sales records without having to leave the application.

When the feature is enabled, while working on Dynamics 365 records, sellers or agents can start a new chat or connect an existing chat to a record, and thus collaborate efficiently without switching context or leaving the application. Connecting all the associated chats to a record helps in maintaining all the chats related to the record in one place. You can also configure an optional introduction message that can be used to provide further context when collaborating on Teams.
