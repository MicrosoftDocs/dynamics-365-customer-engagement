# Use the personal dashboard 


You can use the Dynamics 365 app for Microsoft Teams for your own use. If you want to work with other team members, consider the [team app](teams-collaboration.md).

## Navigate to your personal dashboard

1. From the Teams app > **More added apps** > **Dynamics 365** app.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Open the Dynamics 365 app](media/teams-pick-app.png "Open the Dynamics 365 app")

2. Select the **My Dashboard** tab.

 > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
 > ![Open the Dynamics 365 app Dashboard](media/teams-mydashboard.png "Open the Dynamics 365 app dashboard")


## My Dashboard tab

Select the **My Dashboard** tab to view your model-driven app dashboard in Microsoft Teams. The dashboard displayed is based on who is signed in and their user role.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
![Dynamics 365 apps dashboard](media/teams-bot-dashboard.png "Dynamics 365 apps dashboard")

## Settings tab

If you have more than one environment or model-driven app, you can use the **Settings** tab to select a different environment or app to appear as a dashboard.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
![Dashboard settings](media/teams-settings-page.png "Dashboard settings")

> [!NOTE]
> - Only Common Data Service environments (version 9.x or later) that are active, appear in the list (those that are not disabled).
> - Only Unified Interface apps are listed.
> - Only app modules licensed for the selected environment are listed.
