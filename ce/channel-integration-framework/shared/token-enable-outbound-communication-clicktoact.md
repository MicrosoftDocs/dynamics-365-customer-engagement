## Register the event handler in JavaScript code using the onclicktoact event

During the initialization of the function, register the handler for the `onlicktoact` event.

```JavaScript
function initCTI() {
    Microsoft.CIFramework.setClickToAct(true);
    Microsoft.CIFramework.addHandler("onclicktoact", clickToActHandler);
    log("Added clickToActhandler to the panel");
}
```
Make sure to add `initCTI`, which is an initialization method in the softphone sample code, in your own initialization code.

## Trigger the onclicktoact event

Select the mobile phone icon to trigger the `onclicktoact` event, as shown below.

|Mobile phone with customizations|Mobile phone icon without customizations|
|----|----|
|![Select mobile phone icon to trigger the onclicktoact event](../media/custom-control-phone-icon.PNG "Select mobile phone icon to trigger the onclicktoact event") |![Select the mobile phone icon to trigger the onclicktoact event](../media/oob-phone-icon.PNG "Select the mobile phone icon to trigger the onclicktoact event")|

> [!Note]
> Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework invokes the onclicktoact event only if you programmatically set the `setClickToAct` API to `true` or configure the **Enable Outbound Communication** to **Yes** in the channel provider configurations.
