# Integrate with multisession apps

You can integrate Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework 2.0 with multisession apps like Customer Service workspace and Omnichannel for Customer Service. 

Customer Service workspace seamlessly allows customer service representatives to manage conversations across different channels. It's a modern, customizable, high-productivity app that allows representatives to work on multiple sessions at a time in a single workspace.

The Omnichannel for Customer Service app enables organizations to instantly connect and engage with their customers via channels like Chat for Dynamics 365 Customer Service and SMS. The app provides a context-rich multitasking experience across different customer sessions.
