# Overview of templates in Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework 2.0

When you (an agent) get an incoming conversation request, Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework version 2.0 allows channel providers to search and open records on an incoming call. However, your organization might have different requirements and want to use different custom entities and correlate to a conversation.

Also, the **Omnichannel for Customer Service app** allows you to open non-Microsoft web applications in the application tabs. Your organization might have different line-of-business applications, and while starting a session, you might want to load the line-of-business applications for a specific conversation type.

To choose the applications the agents open for every session, according to your organization requirements, the administrator can create templates:

- [Session templates](session-templates-cif.md)
- [Application tab templates](application-tab-templates-cif.md)
- [Notification templates](notification-templates-cif.md)

These templates are managed in **Customer Service admin center** > **Agent experiences** > **Workspaces**.

> [!WARNING]
> It is recommended that you donâ€™t edit the out-of-the-box sample templates in the package because it affects the functionality.
