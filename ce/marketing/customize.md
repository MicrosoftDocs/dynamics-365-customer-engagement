# Customizing [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)]

[!INCLUDE[cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

[!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] is built on the standard [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] infrastructure, which provides rich possibilities for customization without coding. Customizers can add new fields to existing entities, add or hide fields in list or form views, design custom business processes and workflows, and much more—all while working in their web browser. Other types of customization include installing custom solutions from [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoft-appsource](../includes/pn-microsoft-appsource.md)], such as a third-party SMS solution for [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)]. The system also provides APIs that enable developers to write code that implements even more advanced custom functionality and third-party integration.

The techniques for customizing the [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] application are like those for customizing other [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] Customer Engagement applications—especially [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)]. You can make many of the most common types of customizations while working directly in the **Settings** work area of [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)], but even more types of customization settings are available in the [!include[](../includes/pn-custom-app-module.md)] app.

The [!include[pn-custom-app-module](../includes/pn-custom-app-module.md)] app is included with [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)]. It combines features from many of the various [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] apps you have licensed into a single navigation structure (but most [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] end-user features aren’t included here). The custom app operates on the same database as [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)], so settings made in the custom app (including for customization, user administration, events, LinkedIn Lead Gen, [!INCLUDE[pn-voice-of-the-customer](../includes/pn-voice-of-the-customer.md)], and more) can affect the [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] app.

To go to the customization settings in [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)], go to the **Settings** work area, choose **Advanced Settings**, and then work in the **Customization** section, where you can edit views and business and process flows. To go to the custom app, which provides access to these customization settings and more, choose **[!INCLUDE[pn-custom-app-module](../includes/pn-custom-app-module.md)]** from the app-selector menu, and then go to **Settings** > **Customization**. The following image shows how to use the app-selector menu to switch between the Marketing and custom apps.

For complete details about how to customize [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)], see the [Customization Guide for Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement](../customize/overview.md). That guide describes the interface as you see it in the [!include[](../includes/pn-custom-app-module.md)] app, but the customization features that are also provided in the **Settings** work area of [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] implement similar concepts, operate on the same database, and work similarly. 

For more information about writing code and developing for [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)], see the [Developer Guide for Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement](../developer/developer-guide.md).
