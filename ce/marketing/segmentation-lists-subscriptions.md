# Market segmentation, marketing lists, and subscription lists

[!INCLUDE[cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

You can define your various target groups by setting up segments and lists. Each list or segment represents a collection of contacts that you can use to target a customer journey. You'll also use marketing lists in your subscription center to enable contacts to manually opt-in or opt-out of various types of newsletters and other marketing communications.

## Segments in [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)]

A market segment is the collection of contacts that you target in a marketing campaign. In some cases, you'll simply target all the contacts you have, but in most cases, you'll choose who you want to target based on demographic or firmographic data and other considerations. For example, if you're opening a new store in San Francisco, you'll probably promote the opening-day event at that store only to contacts who live near San Francisco. Or if you're running a sale on dresses, you might only send related marketing email messages to your contacts who are female. Decisions like these will typically also affect the way you communicate with the segment in terms of which channels you'll choose, what kind of graphics you'll pick, which kinds of arguments you make, and more.

[!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] uses segments to target customer journeys. Most customer journeys start with a segment tile, which establishes the collection of contacts who will experience that journey. You can combine multiple segments here.

### Types of segments

Segments can be dynamic, static, or compound.

- *Dynamic segments* are set up by using logical expressions, such as "all contacts from New York" or "all contacts who like The Mets." Membership in dynamic segments changes constantly to reflect new or removed contacts and updated contact information.
- *Static segments* establish a static list of contacts who are selected on a per-contact basis rather than created logically based on field values. Marketers and salespeople might create and populate a static list based on private knowledge or offline interactions.
- *Compound segments* combine existing (live) segments using logical operators.

### Segments are synced with the customer-insights services

[!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] works together with a set of external customer-insights services that operate using their own, external, customer-interaction database to provide advanced segment definitions and customer analytics. The integration is seamless and results in powerful combined functionality when the two systems work together. Your contact records and marketing lists are continuously synchronized between the two systems, which lets the customer-insights services apply their powerful data processing and analytical tools to your contacts, and combine these with information from other types of [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] records and information from other systems.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The customer-insights services process changes to segment membership asynchronously, which means you can't predict the order in which changes are processed. In some cases, such as when processing very large databases, it can take up to six hours for a given segment to get updated. You therefore can't rely on any one segment being processed before or after a specific other segment, so be careful when orchestrating related campaigns and/or using  [suppression segments](customer-journeys-create-automated-campaigns.md#suppression-segment).

### Segments must be live before you can use them

When you first create a new segment, it is in a _draft_ state, which means that it is unlocked, so you can work with its definition and other settings, but you won't be able to use it in customer journeys or compound segments. When you are ready to use your segment, you must open it and select **Go Live** from the command bar, which enables it and moves to the _live_ state.

If you need to edit a segment after it has gone live, open it and then select **Stop** from the command bar to put it back into the draft state.

## View, create, and manage your segments

To work with your segments, go to **Marketing** &gt; **Customers** &gt; **Segments**. This opens a standard list view, which you can use to search, sort, filter, create, and delete your segments. Open any segment to view its details, or select **New** to create a new one.

![The General tab for segments](media/segment-general.png "The General tab for segments")

Segment records provide several tabs for describing, defining, and reviewing the segment. Tabs are shown as a set of headings under the header, which shows the name of the segment. Select any of these headings to go to the relevant tab. Each tab is described briefly in the following subsections.

### The General tab

The **General** tab provides general information about the segment, including:

- **Name**: Enter a name that will make the segment easy for you and others to identify while working in [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)].
- **Segment Type**: Set the segment to dynamic, static, or compound. This setting controls which types of settings you'll see for populating the list on the **Definition** tab.
- **Status reason**: Shows whether the segment is draft or live. Only live segments are available for use in customer journeys and compound segments.

### The Definition tab

Use the **Definition** tab to establish membership of the segment. For dynamic segments, you'll get a query builder here. For static segments, you'll select specific contacts one at a time.

The settings on this tab are described in more detail later in this topic.

### The Related tab

This is actually a drop-down list that you can use to find other types of records (such as customer journeys) that use or reference the current segment. When you choose an entity name here, a new tab named for that entity opens, showing a list of all found records. The **Related** tab remains available, and you can still use it to find other types of records that reference the current segment.

## Define a static segment

To create a static segment, set its **Segment type** to **Static** on the **General** tab. Then use the **Definition** tab to find and add contacts to it, one at a time.

When you are working with a static segment, the **Definition** tab lists all of the contacts from your database, with a check box shown for each. Select the check box for each contact you want to include in the segment, and clear the check box for all other contacts.

Because your database probably includes a large number of contacts, the **Definition** tab can't show all of them at once. It provides paging controls at the bottom and a search filter at the top. Select the filter button at the top of the list to open a form where you can build a query that can help you find the contacts you want to add.

> [!TIP]
> Each time you adjust the filter settings, you must select the **Apply** button to update the list.

## Define a dynamic a segment

To create a dynamic segment, set its **Segment type** to **Dynamic** on the **General** tab. Then use the **Definition** tab to build your dynamic segment by combing _groups_ of _logical expressions_, each of which results in a set of contacts. Each group establishes a _path_ through one or more entities that must end at the **Contact** entity (the order matters).

### Define a segment group

Each group in your segment results in a list of contacts, which are selected by the logic defined in that group. For example, you might build a path as follows:

1. Start with the **Marketing List** entity to find a marketing list named **subscribers**.
1. Continue to the **Accounts** entity to find the accounts from that list, and find only companies working in the insurance industry.
1. End at the **Contacts** entity to find the contacts from those accounts, and find only contacts living in California.

Because the path ends with contacts, the result is a list of contacts who live in California and work for insurance companies that are on the **subscribers** list. (Many segment groups that you create will probably query the **Contacts** entity only, but even groups such as these might employ complex logic that combines multiple AND and OR clauses.)

When working in the **Designer** view, you can build this query by using the **+ And** buttons and various drop-down lists to produce the following:

![An example of a segment group definition](media/segment-designer-example.png "An example of a segment group definition")

Another way to work here is to use the **Explore** view, which provides a graphical map of the path you're creating. To use that view, select the **Explore** button for a group on the **Definition** tab. (It's also available on the **Flow** tab; more on that later.)

![The segment explorer](media/segment-explorer-example1.png "The segment explorer")

The map at the top of the explorer shows the entities that are available for use when creating segments. The map is updated as you build your query group to indicate which paths are still valid. It uses the following colors and line weights to indicate this:

- **Turquoise circle**: marks the target entity—all paths must end here (currently, always **Contact**).
- **Green circle**: marks the currently selected entity. The attributes belonging to this entity are listed below the map. Use the drop-down lists and input fields here to build a query that finds the records you want from the selected entity. After setting up a row, select **+** on the right side to add that expression to the query.
- **Blue circles**: mark entities that are not yet used, but are still available.
- **Gray circles**: mark entities that are no longer selectable because of settings you've already made for the current path.
- **Blue, bold lines**: mark paths that are not yet used, but are still available.
- **Gray, bold lines**: mark paths that are already part of the query.
- **Gray, thin lines**: mark paths that are no longer available because of settings you've already made.

Close the **Explore** view by selecting **OK**. Your resulting query is then shown in the **Designer**, just as though you had created it there (as shown previously).

The following image shows the previous query midway through construction, where we're adding the account criterion. Note how the map colors indicate where you are, where you've been, and what you can (and can't) do next.

![The segment explorer map, showing progress](media/segment-explorer-example2.png "The segment explorer map, showing progress")

> [!NOTE]
> On adding the final **Contacts** entity to the expression we've been describing in this example, you'll be asked to choose which of the available paths to use.
> 
> ![The multiple-paths dialog](media/segment-explorer-multiple-paths.png "The multiple-paths dialog")
> 
> The correct one is **contact\_account\_accountid\__\<suffix\>_**, which establishes how the contact entity relates to the account entity.

### Combine segment groups

A simple segment might have just one group, but you can create and combine as many groups as needed. As a result, you can create highly sophisticated queries.

You combine groups, working first group to last, by using the following operators:

- **Union**: combines all members of a group with the results of the previous group.
- **Exclude**: removes members of a group from the results of the previous group.
- **Intersect**: removes all members from the previous group that are not also members of the current group.

When you're working on the **Designer** tab, use the **+ Add Group** button to add a group and choose its operator.

The **Flow** tab provides another view of how your groups are combined. Here, you get a Sankey diagram of how your groups are combined, and how contacts flow into and out of the segment as a result of the operation from each group.

![Sankey diagram on the Flow tab](media/segment-sankey-example.png "Sankey diagram on the Flow tab")

You can also add new groups while working on the **Flow** tab, which provides the same **Explore** view described previously for defining the group.

## Define a compound segment

A compound segment combines one or more existing segments into a single new segment. To create a compound segment:

1. Create or edit a segment and, on the **General** tab, set its **Segment type** to **Compound segment**.

1. Go to the **Definition** tab, which shows a drop-down list for selecting your first member segment. Choose an existing segment and then select the submit button next to the list.  
    ![Choose the first segment](media/segment-compound-step1.png "Choose the first segment")
    > [!TIP]
    > Only existing, live segments are shown in the list. If you don't see a segment here that you are expecting, check to make sure it's live (not draft).

1. Your chosen segment is added, and a new **Add Operation** block is shown. If you want to combine another segment with the current result, then choose an operation here.  
    ![Choose an operation for combining a new segment with the current result](media/segment-compound-step2.png "Choose an operation for combining a new segment with the current result")

    The operations work as follows:
    - **Union**: will combine all members of the next segment with the results so far.
    - **Exclude**: removes members of the next segment from the results so far.
    - **Intersect**: removes all members from the results so far that are not also members of the next segment.

1. A new block is added, which once again asks you to choose a segment. As before, choose a segment and select the submit button to apply it.  
    ![Choose a segment to apply using the selected operation](media/segment-compound-step3.png "Choose a segment to apply using the selected operation")

1. Continue to compose your segment by adding more segments as needed and choosing an operation for each. As with the **Flow** view for dynamic, segments, you'll build a Sankey diagram of how your segments are combined, and how contacts flow into and out of the segment as a result of each operation.  
    ![Sankey diagram for a compound segment](media/segment-compound-step4.png "Sankey diagram for a compound segment")
    > [!TIP]
    > To edit or remove a segment already shown in the diagram, hover over the upper-right corner of a displayed tile to reveal edit and delete buttons, which you can select to edit or delete that tile.

## Set up marketing lists for use with subscription centers

Subscription lists enable contacts to add or remove themselves from a static marketing list, which you can then use to create a segment that targets members of that list, for example to deliver a monthly newsletter.

To set up a subscription list, you must use the [!INCLUDE[pn-custom-app-module](../includes/pn-custom-app-module.md)] app to create the static marketing list and mark it as a subscription list. Then you'll be able to set up a segment tile in a customer journey to use that list as a target segment. Lists marked as subscription lists are also available for use on your subscription centers, but static segments are not.

For details about how to create marketing lists and use them in subscription centers and segment tiles, see [Set up subscription lists and subscription centers](set-up-subscription-center.md).

## Create segments based on opportunities

Here's an example of how to define a segment that starts by finding a collection of opportunities and, as usual, ends by finding the contacts that belong to that segment. In this example, we'll find contacts associated with opportunities valued over $10,000.

1. If your [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] instance isn't already set up to sync opportunities with the customer-insights services, talk to your admin about setting this up. If you are the admin, then see [Choose entities to sync with the customer-insights services](marketing-settings.md#dci-sync) for instructions.

1. Go to **Marketing** > **Customers** > **Segments** and select **+ New** from the command bar.

1. Fill out the **General** tab with a name and description for your new segment.

1. Open the **Definition** tab, where you'll find the segment **Designer**. A default contact group is provided, but you don't want a contact group, so select the close button to remove this default group.  
    ![Close the default group](media/segment-opportunity-close-group.png "Close the default group")

1. The default group closes, leaving behind a **Select a profile or relationship** drop-down list. Select **Opportunity** from here. (If you don't see the **Opportunity** entity listed here, then you probably need to set up syncing for this entity as described in the fist step of this procedure; note that it can take up to six hours for a new entity to appear in this list after the first sync.)  
    ![Select the waitlist-item entity](media/segment-opportunity-choose-entity.png "Select the waitlist-item entity")

1. Complete the row to create the logical expression:  
    **Opportunity | Total Amount | &ge; | 10000**.  
    ![Start with the opportunity entity](media/segment-example-opportunity1.png "Start with the opportunity entity")

1. Select **+And** to add a new clause to the group. Now you must choose the relation between the opportunity entity and the contact entity, which is where we need to end up. Choose **opportunity&#95;contact&#95;customerid&#95;_&lt;suffix&gt;_** and set it to match **All&#42;**.  
    ![Set the relation from opportunity to contact](media/segment-example-opportunity2.png "Set the relation from opportunity to contact")

1. Select **+And** to add a final clause to the group, which must end with the contact entity. Set the new clause to use the **contact&#95;_&lt;suffix&gt;_** entity and set it to **All&#42;** to find all contacts associated with the selected opportunities.  
    ![Finish the path to the contact entity](media/segment-example-opportunity3.png "Finish the path to the contact entity")

1. Your group will now find contacts associated with opportunities valued over $10,000.

> [!NOTE]
> If you leave the **Designer** tab and then come back, you'll notice that the middle (relation) clause has disappeared. Don't worry, it's still there in the background (and you can still see it on the **Query** tab), but the interface hides it to make the group easier to read.
