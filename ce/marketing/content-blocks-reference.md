# Content blocks reference

[!INCLUDE[cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

The following content blocks are available for use with the designer&mdash;some are available for all designers and some are specific to email, marketing pages, or forms.

[!INCLUDE[proc-more-information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Design your digital content](design-digital-content.md)

## Common design blocks

This section provides full details for the design blocks that are provided in all (or nearly all) of the contexts where the designer appears (email, marketing pages, and marketing forms).

### Text blocks

Text blocks create a block of text within a column.

You can edit the text of any new or existing text block by working directly in the block on the canvas. Use the inline toolbar at the top of the selected text block to do inline styling like font face, font color, bold, italic, paragraph justification, and more. You can also delete, clone, or move a selected text block by using the toolbar.

![The text-block toolbar](media/text-block-toolbar.png "The text-block toolbar")

Select a text block and use the settings provided on the **Properties** tabs to stylize the block itself by using colors, fonts, margins, borders, and backgrounds. Many of the settings on the **Style** tab (which apply to the overall page, form, or message design) also affect the styling of text-block content unless overruled locally.

For email messages, the text toolbar includes an assist-edit button, which is marked with **</>**. Use this to place dynamic text, including field values such as the recipient's name. [!INCLUDE[proc-more-information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Add dynamic content to email messages](dynamic-email-content.md)

### Image blocks

Image blocks add an image to a column, outside a text block. Image blocks interact with the [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] image gallery, which helps you store, categorize, find, and share your image files.

When you first add an image block, an image placeholder appears at the location where you dropped the block. Select the image placeholder and open the **Properties** tab, where you can set the following options.

- **Source**: Select the **Image Gallery** button next to this field to select an existing image from the gallery, or to upload a new one. When an image is selected, its file name is shown here.
- **Alt text**: Enter a short description of the image. This text will be read aloud to contacts that are using a screen reader, and will also be shown to contacts that have images disabled in their browser or email client. 
- **Link**: Enter a URL here if you'd like the image to function as a link.
- **Alignment**: Choose how the image should be aligned relative to its column (left, right, or center).

When you select an image block, you can use an inline toolbar to delete, clone, or move the block.

### Divider blocks

Divider blocks insert a horizontal line (&lt;hr&gt;) in a column, outside a text block.

Use the **Properties** and **Style** tabs to establish the appearance of your new or selected divider.

When you select a divider block, you can use an inline toolbar to delete, clone, or move the block.

### Button blocks

Button blocks create a colorful call-to-action button in a column, outside a text block. Each button is created by using pure HTML text and styling only (no image files), and acts as a link to the URL you define for it.

Use the **Properties** tab to establish the appearance of your new or selected button.

When you select a button block, you can use an inline toolbar to style the button text and to delete, clone, or move the block.

## Email-only blocks

This section describes content blocks that are only available when you are designing a marketing email message.

<a name="event-blocks"></a>

### Marketing-page, event, and survey blocks

Each of these types of blocks creates a colorful button in a new row (outside a text block) that links to a page, event, or survey (depending on the block type). The button is created using pure HTML text and styling only (no image files), and acts as a link to the page, event, or survey you define for it.

Use the **Properties** tab to establish the appearance of your new or selected button, and to choose the page, event, or survey it links to.

## The form block for marketing pages

This section describes the form block, which is only available when you are designing a marketing page. This is currently the only block that is unique for marketing pages.

A form enables visitors to register for something, manage their mailing-list subscriptions, forward a marketing message, or otherwise submit information to interact with your marketing initiatives.

After it is configured, each form block places a *marketing form*, which defines the actual fields and field layout that the form will contain. You'll define your marketing forms separately, and build a library of reusable forms that you can place on various marketing pages as needed. When you add a form block, you'll be able to choose from this library to decide which form to use on the current page. The form block also provides settings on its **Properties** tab that control how the form will behave and appear on the current page. [!INCLUDE[proc-more-information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Create, view and manage marketing forms](create-deploy-marketing-pages.md#create-view-and-manage-marketing-forms)

To configure a form block, select it in your layout, open the **Properties** tab, and make the following settings:

- **Marketing form**: Choose the marketing form to be placed by the form block. Usually, you'll just use an existing form, but you can also create a new one from here if needed. You can only select or create a marketing form that matches the current page type.
- **Update contacts/leads:** This is a read-only field that shows whether the selected marketing form is set to update contacts and/or leads in response to form submissions.
- **Confirmation message**: Enter a message to show to visitors right after they submit the form. Use this to thank the submitter and confirm their submission.
- **Error message**: Enter a short message that tells the user that a temporary error has prevented the system from accepting the form submission. For example, "We can't accept your form submission right now. Please try again later."
- **Limit exceeded message**: Enter a short message announcing that the system has stopped processing new submissions temporarily, and inviting the user to try again later. This situation can occur if the server detects a submission pattern consistent with abuse of the system and has therefore entered a defensive stance.
- **Redirect URL**: Enter a URL to send the submitter to immediately after they submit the form. This typically would be a page on your own website that thanks the submitter and confirms their submission, or some other message related to the purpose of your marketing page.

## Form content blocks

The designer provides many blocks that are unique to marketing forms. They are all related to positioning and configuring various types of input fields and form controls.

### Field blocks

Each field block creates a single form control (such as an input field, check box, or radio button set) that is mapped to the contact and/or lead entity in [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)]. For each marketing-form field that you've set up, you'll find a unique component named after the field under the **Fields** heading of the designer's **Toolbox** tab. So, for example, if you've mapped the **First Name** field of the contact entity to a marketing-form field called "First Name", you'll also have a block called **First Name** under the **Fields** heading of the form designer. [!INCLUDE[proc-more-information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Create and deploy marketing pages](create-deploy-marketing-pages.md)

![Field-block settings](media/field-block-details.png "Field-block settings")

When you add or select a field in your form, you can read and set the following properties on the **Properties** tab:

- **Name**: Shows the name of the field mapping this block represents (read-only).
- **Label Position**: Describes the position of the field label relative to the field (No label, At top, On left, On right).
- **Label**: Shows the field-label text to display for the field.
- **Default Value**: Shows the default value for the field (optional).
- **Placeholder**: Displays "ghost text" in the field until a value is entered, typically shown in a gray color. You can use this as an alternative to, or in addition to, the field label. This isn't a default value because if the user doesn't enter a value, the field is submitted as blank.
- **Required**: Marks the field as mandatory. Mandatory fields display an asterisk in the form, and the form will be rejected if somebody tries to submit it without filling out all the required fields.
- **Required Error Message**: Specifies the error message shown if somebody tries to submit the form without filling out all the required fields.
- **Prefill**: Select this box to enable prefilling for this field. When enabled, the form will try to display a prefilled value for this field when it recognizes the visitor (because the visitor previously submitted a form with the remember-me box checked).

### Subscription-list blocks

Each subscription-list block creates a check box that a visitor can select to subscribe to, or unsubscribe from, one of your mailing lists. For each static marketing list that you've configured as a subscription list, you'll find a unique block named after that list under the **Subscription Lists** heading of the designer's **Toolbox** tab. [!INCLUDE[proc-more-information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Set up subscription lists and subscription centers](set-up-subscription-center.md)

Subscription list blocks are only available when you are working with a subscription center or landing page form, and their behavior is slightly different in each case:

- **Landing pages**: When the form is submitted, the contact is added to all lists that are checked, but is not removed from lists that are unchecked. You can choose the default value (checked or unchecked) for each list as needed. Subscription lists on landing pages aren't prefilled to indicate the visitor's current subscriptions.
- **Subscription centers**: When the form is opened, each check box is always prefilled to indicate the current visitor's subscriptions. When the form is submitted, the contact is added to all lists that are checked, *and removed* from lists that are unchecked.

When you add or select a subscription-list block for a form, you can read and set the following in properties on the **Properties** tab:

- **Subscription List**: Shows the name of the subscription list the block represents (read-only). You can click here to open the list itself.
- **Default Value**: This is only available if you are working with a landing-page form. Use it to set the default state of the check box (checked or unchecked).
- **Label Position**: Position of the label (list name) relative to the check box.
- **Label**: The name of the subscription list, as shown on the form.

### Forward-to-a-friend blocks

Forward-to-a-friend blocks create a collection of input fields that recipients of your marketing email messages can use to forward a copy of that message to each email address that they specify.

All forward-to-a-friend forms must include exactly one forward-to-a-friend block. This block is not available for other types of forms.

When you add or select a forward-to-a-friend block in your form, you can read and set the following in properties on the **Properties** tab:

- **Ask for friend's name**: Controls whether to include a field for entering names in addition to email addresses. The form always requests email addresses.
- **Number of recipients**: Sets the number of name/email input pair fields created by the block.

### Do-not-bulk-email blocks

Do-not-bulk-email blocks add a check box to a subscription center form that enables visitors to opt out of all marketing email messages. This feature is required by law in many jurisdictions, and helps maintain your organization's email reputation throughout the internet, thus helping to keep your marketing messages from getting filtered away or stuck in spam traps.

All subscription center forms must include exactly one do-not-bulk-email block. You can also include this block in landing-page forms, but it's not required.

The do-not-bulk-email block is a standard form-field block that is permanently configured to map to the "Do not bulk email" field of the contact entity. Other than this, all its properties are the same as those for standard field blocks, as described in [Field blocks](#field-blocks).

### Remember-me blocks

Remember-me blocks add a remember-me feature to your form. If a visitor submits a form with the remember-me box selected, the form will be prefilled with known values the next time they open one of your [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] forms (while using that same computer and browser). Only the fields specifically configured to allow prefilling will be filled the next time. You should always include a block of this type on marketing pages that are enabled for prefilling. [!INCLUDE[proc-more-information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Field blocks](#field-blocks)

The remember-me block is a standard form-field block that is permanently configured to map to the "Allow form prefill" field of the contact entity. Other than this, all its properties are the same as those for standard form fields, as described in [Field blocks](#field-blocks).

### Submit-button blocks

Submit-button blocks create a submit button for the form. All forms must include exactly one of these. Its only property is the button text, which establishes the text shown on the button.

[!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] automatically adds a submit-button block to each new form you create. This type of block is not otherwise available in the **Toolbox**, so you should take care not to delete it from your forms because there is no way to add it again (other than immediate undo).

### Reset-button blocks

Reset-button blocks create a reset button for the form, which when selected removes all values for all fields in that form. All forms must include exactly one of these. Its only property is the button text, which establishes the text shown on the button.

Reset-button blocks are only available when you are working with a forward-to-a-friend or landing-page form.

### Captcha blocks

Captcha blocks add a captcha to your form, which helps make sure that only humans can submit the form, thus preventing bots from filling your database full of spam or noise.

![A captcha block and its settings](media/captcha-block.png "A captcha block and its settings")

You've probably seen captchas before. They require you to recognize and repeat a set of characters designed to be difficult for a computer to recognize.

The only property for captcha blocks is the **Language**, which sets the language used in the instructions displayed for the captcha.

Captcha blocks are only available when you are working with a landing-page form. Forwarding pages and subscription centers don't need a captcha because they are only available to registered contacts.
