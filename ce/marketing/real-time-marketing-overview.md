# Real-time marketing overview

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A preview feature is a feature that is not complete, but is made available before it’s officially in a release so customers can get early access and provide feedback. Preview features aren’t meant for production use and may have limited or restricted functionality.
> 
> Microsoft doesn't provide support for this preview feature. Microsoft Dynamics 365 Technical Support won’t be able to help you with issues or questions. Preview features aren’t meant for production use, especially to process personal data or other data that are subject to legal or regulatory compliance requirements.

Dynamics 365 Marketing isn't just for marketers anymore. With AI and natural language input assistance, business users can build event-based journeys that reach customers across multiple touch-points, growing relationships from prospects, through sales and support. Dynamics 365 Marketing’s real-time marketing features enable organizations to:

## Engage customers in real-time

- With features such as [event-based customer journeys](real-time-marketing-event-based-journey.md), [custom event triggers](real-time-marketing-custom-events.md), and [SMS](real-time-marketing-outbound-text-messaging.md) and [push notifications](real-time-marketing-push-notifications.md), organizations can trigger customer journeys in real-time, pick the right channel for each individual, and react to customer-led actions in the moments that matter.

## Win customers and earn loyalty faster

- Working across all customer touchpoints, real-time customer journeys are truly an end-to-end experience.

## Personalize customer experiences with AI

- Turn insights into relevant action with AI-driven recommendations for content, channels, and analytics.
- [Customer Insights segment and profile integration](real-time-marketing-ci-profile.md) allows organizations to seamlessly leverage the deep customer understanding in Customer Insights.

## Grow with a unified, adaptable platform

- Easily customize and connect with tools you already use.
- Efficiently manage compliance requirements and accessibility guidelines.
