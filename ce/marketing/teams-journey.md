# How to sign up for a free 6-month Dynamics 365 Marketing trial

The Dynamics 365 Marketing trial allows you to use the Marketing app to stay in touch with your webinar participants before and after hosting a webinar. You can send personalized registration materials, send surveys, and more to drive awareness and engagement.

To sign up for a 6-month Dynamics 365 Marketing trial:

1. [Host a webinar in Teams](/microsoftteams/set-up-webinars) with at least one attendee.
1. In Teams, select the **Attendance** tab to view the attendance report.
1. On the top bar, select **Follow up with participants**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot of the Follow up with participants button](media/teams-follow-up2.png "Screenshot of the Follow up with participants button")

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The **Follow up with participants** button only appears in the attendance tab *after* the webinar has ended. The button is not shown if you do not meet eligibility criteria or if your organization has disabled trials.

1. Select **Get started**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot of the Get started button](media/teams-follow-up-get-started2.png "Screenshot of the Get started button")

1. You will see some additional screens while the trial is being set up and configured. Once setup is complete, a browser tab will open with a Dynamics 365 Marketing customer journey page that contains your webinar data, allowing you to personalize emails to follow up with your webinar participants.

## Here's what you can do by connecting Teams to Dynamics 365 Marketing

Let's say you've hosted a Microsoft Teams webinar and are reviewing your [Teams attendance report](/microsoftteams/teams-analytics-and-reports/meeting-attendance-report). Maybe some guests registered but didn't attend, while others canceled their registrations. You wish you could follow up with the guests to get feedback or tell them about an upcoming webinar that is more relevant to their interests. Maybe you'd like to send a survey to learn what content guests would like to hear about in the next webinar. By integrating Teams with Dynamics 365 Marketing, you can engage your webinar attendees, converting participants to loyal customers.

Marketing helps you automate and personalize the follow-up process and helps you plan for future webinar events. Using Marketing with Teams, you can:

- Store and manage webinar participant contact information.
- Create groups of participants for targeted messaging (for example, participants who attended, who didn't attend, or who canceled).
- Use built-in email templates to send personalized emails that look professionally designed.
- Advertise upcoming events and webinars.

## Easy, risk-free trial

The 6-month trial allows you to immediately connect Teams to Dynamics 365 Marketing. You don't even need a credit card to sign up. Dynamics 365 Marketing is web-based, so no installation on your computer is required. Your data is secure with Microsoft; your data will not be shared outside of your company.

To learn more about the trial requirements and eligibility, visit the [Teams trial offer page](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/marketing/offer/).

## What happens when the trial expires?

When your Dynamics 365 Marketing trial expires, your administrator will have to purchase a license for the app if you wish to continue using it.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Teams and Dynamics 365 Marketing each have their own [service-specific licensing terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/productoffering). The service-specific terms that apply depend on which service processes your data. For example, when you transition from Microsoft Teams to Dynamics 365 Marketing, your Microsoft Teams data related to the webinar (such as the attendance report, engagement data, etc.) is transferred to Dynamics 365 Marketing whereupon it becomes Dynamics 365 Marketing data and the Dynamics 365 service-specific terms apply.
