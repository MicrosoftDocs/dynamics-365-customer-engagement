# Create and run online surveys

[!INCLUDE[cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

[!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] includes a Surveys app, which you can use to design and publish online surveys that can be integrated with your events, marketing emails, and customer journeys.

In the current version of [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)], Surveys is provided as a separate application, but it still operates on the same database as your other [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] applications, so it has access to the same records (such as contacts and accounts), and the surveys you design will be available to other [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] features.

Use the app-selector menu to switch between Surveys and your other [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] apps.

Unlike other [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] apps and work areas, the Surveys app provides a navigator at the top of the page rather than in a side column.

Go to **Voice of the Customer** to design your surveys. The functionality provided here is the same as that provided for other [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] applications that include the Voice of the Customer feature.

Go to **Marketing** to access your [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] dashboards, activities, and customer data. This is the same data you'll find in your [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] app and is provided here for convenience. These entities work just like they do in other [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] applications, including [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)].
