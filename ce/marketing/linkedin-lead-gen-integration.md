# [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Lead Gen integration

[!INCLUDE[cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

 [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] includes a connector for [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Lead Gen. Use this feature to see how people are interacting with your marketing initiatives on [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] and to bring leads and lead information generated by using the [LinkedIn Lead Gen](https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/native-advertising/lead-gen-ads) tools into [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)].

[!INCLUDE [cc-linkedin-disclaimer](../includes/cc-linkedin-disclaimer.md)]

## Enable lead sync from [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] to [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)]

To enable leads to be synced from [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] to [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)]:

- A system admin must [assign security roles to users and set up the matching strategy](linkedin-configuration.md) for new leads from [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)]. In [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)], this user must have the **[!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Lead Gen Forms Connector Administrator** security role.

- At least one [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] member with access to [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Campaign Manager must [Authorize Dynamics 365 to sync data from LinkedIn Campaign Manager](#authorize-dynamics-365-to-sync-data-from-linkedin-campaign-manager), as described in the following section. In [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)], this user requires at least a **[!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Lead Gen Forms Connector Salesperson** security role.

For more information about assigning security roles to users, see [Create users in Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement (online) and assign security roles](../admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles.md)

### Authorize Dynamics 365 to sync data from LinkedIn Campaign Manager

To use this feature, you must authorize [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] to connect to [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] using an existing [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] account that has access to [LinkedIn Campaign Manager](https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/56969). To do this: 

1. Go to **Marketing** &gt; **[!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Lead Gen** &gt; **User Profiles**. A list of existing profiles opens (if any).

1. Select **Authorize** on the command bar.

1. A browser pop-up window opens with a [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] sign-in form. (If your browser is set to block pop-up windows, then you must configure it to allow pop-ups from your [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] domain then select the **Authorize** button again.)  Enter the credentials for your [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] profile and then select **Sign In**. (If you are already signed into [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] on this browser, then you might skip this step.)

1. A [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] permissions dialog opens, providing details about the connection you are setting up. Read the text and, provided you agree with the terms, select **Allow** to continue. (If you previously accepted these conditions for your [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] account, then you might skip this step.)

1. A [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] authorization dialog opens, providing additional privacy information. Read the text and, provided you agree with the terms, select **Yes** to continue.

1. On success, the system creates a new [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] user profile and syncs it with [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)]. Your new profile opens immediately after this, so you should now see details from your [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] account, including associated accounts, campaigns, and Lead Gen forms. This new profile is also now listed on the **User Profiles** page, where you can select it to return to these details at any time.

Usually it's not required, but you can trigger an optional, on-demand sync of [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] form submissions after authorizing a profile by selecting **Reset synchronization**.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] campaigns automatically create a **Customer Journey** record. To stop these records from being automatically generated, a system admin must edit the **[!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] LeadGen Integration Configurations** entity and change the value for the **Create Journeys for [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Campaigns** attribute from **Yes** to **No**.

## Analyze leads and lead performance

When a new lead is synced from [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)], [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] can either update an existing lead record if the person is already known, or create a new lead if it's the first contact with this person. New [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] leads appear as **[!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Form Submissions** in [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)]. The information in [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] form submissions consists of the answers given by [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] members when they submitted the forms.


When a [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] lead matches a lead record in [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-online-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)], the lead record is updated with additional information. In addition to the updates of individual lead records, charts on dashboards can represent the performance of a marketing campaign on [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)].

### See the details of a lead

To see the details of a lead record in [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)], go to **Marketing** &gt; **Lead management** &gt; **Leads**, and then select the lead record from the list. If the lead was created by [!INCLUDE[cc-linkedin-solution](../includes/cc-linkedin-solution.md)], the lead source is **[!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Sponsored Content**. If an existing lead record was updated, [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] updates the lead field values by using the information submitted by the lead on [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)]. [!INCLUDE[proc-more-information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Create or edit a lead (Sales and Sales Hub)](../sales-enterprise/create-edit-lead-sales.md)

To see the information collected by [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Lead Gen for any lead, regardless of how it was created, open the lead and go to its **[!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Lead Info** tab.

### Review the aggregated lead performance

Work with a dashboard containing charts about the source of new leads or create new dashboards by using the charts that matter the most to get your reporting completed.

When you create your own dashboard, consider adding a chart for the record type **[!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Form Submissions** to see how your campaigns perform compared to each other. Or, you can create a **Leads by Source** chart for the lead record. 

### Analyze individual [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Lead Gen forms and submissions

To see all form submissions in [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)], go to **Marketing** &gt; **[!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Lead Gen** &gt; **Form Submissions**. You can drill down to individual submissions to see the details of the lead and the information provided by the [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] members when they answered the underlying [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Lead Gen form. [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Lead Gen forms refer to the ad campaigns on [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] that generate leads. Every campaign creates a new Lead Gen form, and answers to the campaigns are captured as [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] form submissions.

## See the sync status for [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] data 

Go to **Marketing** > **[!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Lead Gen** > **Sync Status**, to find an aggregated overview about the data that was pulled from all [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] user profiles to [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)]. At a glance, you can see when the most recent synchronization took place and find out how many leads were created or updated.
