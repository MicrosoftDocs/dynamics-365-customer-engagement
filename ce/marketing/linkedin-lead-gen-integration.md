# [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Lead Gen integration

[!INCLUDE[cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

 [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)], includes a connector for [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Lead Gen. Use this feature to see how people are interacting with your marketing initiatives in [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] and to bring leads and lead information generated by using the [LinkedIn Lead Gen](https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/native-advertising/lead-gen-ads) tools in [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)].

To see the information collected by [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Lead Gen, open a lead and go to its **[!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Lead Info** tab.

To sync leads from [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] and run campaigns on [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)], you need access to a [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] account that can manage sponsored content by using [LinkedIn Campaign Manager](https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/56969).

## Enable lead sync from [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] to [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)]

Before we can sync leads from [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] campaign accounts to a [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] organization, a a **[!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Lead Gen Forms Connector Administrator** needs to [assign security roles to users and set up the matching strategy](linkedin-configuration.md) for new leads from [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)].    
Additionally, a [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] member with access to [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Campaign Manager is required to authorize their [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] accounts in [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)]. In [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)], this user requires at least a **[!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Lead Gen Forms Connector Salesperson** security role.

For more information about assigning security roles to users, see [TechNet: Create users and assign Dynamics 365 (online) security roles](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj191623.aspx)

### Authorize [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] to sync data from [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Campaign Manager

[v-tiburd]: <> (In step 5, if the name of the dialog box appears in the UI, make sure the capitalization matches the UI and apply bold formatting.)

1. Go to **Marketing** &gt; **[!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Lead Gen** &gt; **[!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] User Profiles**.

1. To add a new [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] user profile record, select **New**, enter a **Name**, and then select **Save**.

1. To add [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] accounts to this user profile, select **Authorize** on the command bar.

1. Enter the credentials for your [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] profile, and then select **Sign In**.

1. In the permissions dialog box, select **Allow**.

1. Check and confirm the [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] organization to which you want to sync your [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] data.

After successful authorization, the associated [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] accounts are listed in the **Associated [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Accounts** section. You can review the details of the [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] accounts in the form. It might take a few seconds to get the accounts; if you don't see them, refresh the view.

[!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] form submissions are now automatically synced to [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)]. You'll be able to see the data in [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] as soon as the sync is complete, which might take a few minutes. Usually it's not required, but you can trigger an optional, on-demand sync of [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] form submissions after authorizing a profile by selecting **Sync submissions**.

## Analyze leads and lead performance

When a [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] lead matches a lead record in [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-online-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)], the lead record is updated with additional information. In addition to the updates of individual lead records, charts on dashboards can represent the performance of a marketing campaign on [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)].

### See the details of a lead

To see the details of a lead record in [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)], go to **Marketing** &gt; **Lead Management** &gt; **Leads**, and then select the lead record from the list. If the lead was created by [!INCLUDE[cc-linkedin-solution](../includes/cc-linkedin-solution.md)], the lead source is **[!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Sponsored Content**. If an existing lead record was updated, [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] updates the lead field values by using the information submitted by the lead on [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)]. [!INCLUDE[proc-more-information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Create or edit a lead](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p?linkid=832163)

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] campaigns automatically create a **Customer Journey** record. To stop these records from being automatically generated, a system administrator or customizer needs to edit the **[!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] LeadGen Integration Configurations** entity and change the value for the **Create Journeys for [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Campaigns** attribute from **Yes** to **No**. For quick access to this custom entity, consider adding it to the site map.

### Review the aggregated lead performance

Work with a dashboard containing charts about the source of new leads or create new dashboards by using the charts that matter the most to get your reporting completed.

When you create your own dashboard, consider adding a chart for the record type **[!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Form Submissions** to see how your campaigns perform compared to each other. Or, you can create a **Leads by Source** chart for the lead record. 

### Analyze individual [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Lead Gen forms and submissions

To see all form submissions in [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)], go to **Marketing** &gt; **[!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Lead Gen** &gt; **[!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Form Submissions**. You can drill down to individual submissions to see the details of the lead and the information provided by the [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] members when they answered the underlying [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Lead Gen form. [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Lead Gen forms refer to the ad campaigns on [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] that generate leads. Every campaign creates a new Lead Gen form, and answers to the campaigns are captured as [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] form submissions. 

## See the sync status for [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] data 

When you go to **Marketing** > **[!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Lead Gen** > **Sync Status**, you'll find an aggregated overview about the data that was pulled from all [!INCLUDE[pn-linkedin](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] user profiles to [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)]. At a glance, you can see when the most recent synchronization took place and find out how many leads were created or updated.
