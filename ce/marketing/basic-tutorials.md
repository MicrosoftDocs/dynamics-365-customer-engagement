# Core marketing tutorials

The tutorials in this section provide exercises that illustrate the core functionality of Dynamics 365 Marketing. If you've never used this product before, this is the best place to start. When you have completed the exercises here, you'll be able to:

- [Create marketing segments](create-segment.md) that organize contacts from your database into logical groups that match your marketing strategies.

- [Create a marketing email](create-marketing-email.md) that meets all legal and deliverability requirements, and can deliver personalized messages to contacts.

- [Create a simple customer journey](create-simple-customer-journey.md) that sends a marketing email to all members of a segment and records interactions such as message opens and link clicks.

- [Create a landing page](create-landing-page.md) with a form that collects information from new and existing contacts and stores it directly in your organizational database.

- [Create an automated customer journey](create-simple-customer-journey.md) that combines email messaging, landing pages, and multiple paths managed by interactive triggers.

The exercises in this chapter build on one another, so we recommend that new users do them all, in order.
