# Create an inbound customer journey

*Inbound customer journeys* seek to attract new, unknown contacts, so they typically target new contacts who submitted a form on a a landing page to register for a newsletter, download a whitepaper, or some other perk. You'd typically promote your inbound campaign by running ads and posting links on social media. (In comparison, an *outbound* customer journey is one that starts with a segment made up of contacts that are already included in your Dynamics 365 Marketing database, so an outbound journey usually starts by sending out marketing emails to the members of a segment.)

Though messaging and promotion strategies are typically quite different for an inbound campaign compared to an outbound one, you design inbound customer journeys in Dynamics 365 Marketing by using the same basic tools as you would to create an outbound customer journey. The most important difference is that you typically start an inbound customer journey with an audience consisting of contacts who submitted a specific form instead of a segment, though you could also set up a segment that finds contacts who submitted a specific form. In this configuration, all contacts (both new and existing) who submit the form immediately start down that journey.

## Use a form to launch an inbound campaign

You can create an inbound campaign by setting up the contacts who **submitted a form** as the source of your **Audience** tile at the start of a journey, and then configure the tile to reference the marketing-form record that created the embedded or captured form you are using on your external site. This will cause each contact that submits the form to be added to the journey, just as though they had joined a segment targeted by the journey.

## Use an behavioral segment to find contacts who submitted a form

Another way to create an inbound journey is to start with an [behavioral segment](segments-interaction.md) that is based on form-submit or event-registration interactions, and filtered for a specific form or event ID. This technique will work with both native and externally hosted forms, and with event registrations.
