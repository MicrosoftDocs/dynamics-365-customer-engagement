# Register contacts' engagement with your internet marketing initiatives

[!INCLUDE[cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

You can measure customer engagement with your marketing initiatives in several ways, including:

- Adding a script to the pages of your website that enables [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] to record how people use your website and to connect browsing records to anonymous and known contacts.
- Setting up a redirect URL, which logs clicks on links that you post to social-media sites, ad banners, and other places online. You'll be able to see how often a link was used, where it was used, and who used it (when the user is a known contact).

[!INCLUDE[cc-marketing-cookies](../includes/cc-marketing-cookies.md)]

## Monitor how visitors use your website

When people come to your website, they are expressing an interest in your organization and its products. And where they go on your site tells you even more about what they are interested in. Frequent or extended browsing sessions with your site, especially in the products or purchasing areas, can be a strong indicator of a contact who is ready to buy.

[!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] can monitor each visitor who comes to your website by using cookies to identify individual browsers each time they open a page or return to your site. Visitors will be anonymous at first, but after a visitor submits a landing page with contact information, [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] can link the browser cookie to a contact record, and you'll be able to see the full history of how that contact uses your site, including information from when he or she was still anonymous.

To enable website monitoring, you must add [!INCLUDE[pn-javascript](../includes/pn-javascript.md)] code generated by [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] to each page that you want to monitor. Each script that the system generates has a unique ID value, which identifies the individual script and is stored with each visit it records (other than this, each script is identical). [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] treats all visits to pages that have the same script as occurring on the same website. You might use just one script on all pages, or you might set up several different scripts to divide your site into logical areas of interest. If your organization runs several websites (such as one for each brand), you would typically monitor each one separately by using different [!INCLUDE[pn-javascript](../includes/pn-javascript.md)] code on each of them, though you could also monitor them all as a single site. The easiest way to add [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] [!INCLUDE[pn-javascript](../includes/pn-javascript.md)] code to all the pages of your site that need it is probably by adding the code to the page templates in your CMS system.

### Find or create monitoring code for your website

For each collection of webpages that you want to treat as a discrete unit in [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)], you must set up a website record, which generates a monitoring [!INCLUDE[pn-javascript](../includes/pn-javascript.md)] script for use on those pages.

1. Go to **Marketing** &gt; **Internet Marketing** &gt; **Websites** to see the current list of websites you are monitoring.

1. Find the website you want to work with, or select **New** to create a new one.

1. Your new or existing website record opens. Here you can enter and read description information and settings for your website. You'll also find results and analytics gathered for the current site so far (if any). The following settings and information are most important when setting up a website for monitoring:

    - **Name**: Shows a name for the website record, which you'll see in the list view and anywhere else you need to identify the record.
    - **Timeout**: The system counts all page loads requested by a single visitor within a short space of time as belonging to the same session. A session is closed when the amount of time specified here passes with no new page requests from that visitor.
    - **[!INCLUDE[pn-javascript](../includes/pn-javascript.md)] code**: This is the code that you must place on each webpage that you want to monitor as part of the current website. It is read-only. Copy the code from here and paste it onto each webpage (or CMS template) as needed.

1. Select **Save** or **Save & Close** to save your work.

### View site-visit data and analytics

The same website record where you find the [!INCLUDE[pn-javascript](../includes/pn-javascript.md)] monitoring code also shows the data collected by using that code. To see the results, go to **Marketing** &gt; **Internet Marketing** &gt; **Websites** and open the website record you want to examine. Browse the following three tabs to see what has been happening on your site:

- **General Info**: This is where you find the basic metadata and [!INCLUDE[pn-javascript](../includes/pn-javascript.md)] code for the current site. After your script has started to collect data, you'll find the results here, including your top 10 pages and other information.
- **Timeline**: Shows a detailed timeline of each click recorded for the current website over time.
- **Browsers & Operating Systems**: Shows data about which browsers and operating systems visitors are using when they come to your site.

## Monitor visitors to your [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] marketing pages

Each time you publish a marketing page, [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] sets up a new website (including unique [!INCLUDE[pn-javascript](../includes/pn-javascript.md)] monitoring code) to monitor interactions with that page only. You'll find these in the **Marketing** &gt; **Internet Marketing** &gt; **Websites** list next to your other websites. For more information about how to work with website monitoring and view the results, see the previous section.

## Set up redirect URLs

*Redirect URLs* are links that redirect through your [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] server on their way to some other piece of content that the person who clicked the link is actually looking for.

[!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] logs each click on a redirect URL as it passes the user on to the actual target. By using redirect URLs in your banner ads, tweets, [!INCLUDE[tn-facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] posts, and elsewhere, you'll be able to see how many people clicked on each of those links, where they were when they did so, and more. This can help you evaluate which of your communication channels are having the greatest impact, and which you should improve or abandon.

### Find or create a redirect URL

To find or create a redirect URL.

1. Go to **Marketing** &gt; **Internet Marketing** &gt; **Redirect URLs** to see the current list of redirect URLs you have set up.

1. Find the redirect URL you want to work with, or select **New** to create a new one.

1. Your new or existing redirect-URL record opens. Here you can enter and read description information and settings for your redirect URL. You'll also find results and analytics gathered for the current redirect URL so far (if any). The following settings and information are most important when setting up a redirect URL:

    - **Name**: Shows a name for the redirect-URL record, which you'll see in the list view and anywhere else where you need to identify the record.
    - **Original URL**: This is the page or download that will open when somebody clicks on the redirect URL (after being logged and forwarded from the [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] server).
    - **Redirecting URL**: This is the redirecting URL, generated by [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)], that you can copy and use wherever you want to post the link. It is generated the first time you save the record.

1. Select **Save** to save your work and generate the redirecting URL.

### View redirect URL click data and analytics

The same redirect-URL record where you can find the redirecting URL also shows the data collected by using that URL. To see these results, go to **Marketing** &gt; **Internet Marketing** &gt; **Redirect URLs** and open the redirect-URL record you want to examine. Browse the following two tabs to see information gathered by the URL:

- **General Info**: This is where you find the basic metadata and the redirecting URL itself. After your redirecting URL has started to collect data, you'll find the results here, including a map with geodata and other information from [!INCLUDE[pn-customer-insights-full](../includes/pn-customer-insights-full.md)].
- **Timeline**: Shows a detailed timeline of each click recorded over time.
