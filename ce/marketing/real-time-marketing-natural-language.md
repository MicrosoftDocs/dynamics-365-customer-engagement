# Use natural language in real-time marketing journeys

Natural language input enables you to use common words and phrases to describe a condition you want to include in your customer journey. The data model is built on top of Common Data Model (CDM).

## Sample conditions

You can create a segment that will evaluate your Dynamics 365 organizational database for customers who meet a certain criterion. For example, customers with an annual income of $100,000.

The following are examples of simple conditional phrases using natural language:

**Search by company**

- Customers who work at Microsoft (Profile)
- People who work in a company named Amazon (Profile/Contact)

**Search by demographic**

-	Female customers (Profile)
-	Contacts in Seattle (Contacts)
-	Customers who are in Ohio (Contacts)
-	Contacts with vice president as job title (Contacts)
-	Customers with vice president as job title (Contacts/Profile)
	 
**Search based on customer preferences**

-	Active contacts (Contacts)

**Search by segment membership within your organization** 

- Customers who are in Loyalty Segment
