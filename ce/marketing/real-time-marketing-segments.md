# Work with real-time marketing segments

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A preview feature is a feature that is not complete, but is made available before it’s officially in a release so customers can get early access and provide feedback. Preview features aren’t meant for production use and may have limited or restricted functionality.
> 
> Microsoft doesn't provide support for this preview feature. Microsoft Dynamics 365 Technical Support won’t be able to help you with issues or questions. Preview features aren’t meant for production use, especially to process personal data or other data that is subject to legal or regulatory compliance requirements.

## Segments from outbound marketing

Your segments from outbound Marketing should be readily available for you in real-time marketing. To create a journey, select any segment, then select **+ New journey**.

You may distinguish the source of the segment through the column **Source**.

To use segments during journey creation, select segments from any dropdown to use in your **Scheduled** customer journeys.

To exclude a segment in your customer journey, simply select a segment in the **Entry criteria**. Note that the segments shown for exclusion are only segments of the same source. (If you chose a segment source from Outbound Marketing, only Outbound Marketing segments will be shown).

To add a segment to a condition, select any segment in **Attribute**.

## Segments created in Customer Insights

Your segments from [Customer Insights](dynamics365/customer-insights/index.md) should also be readily available to you in **real-time Marketing**.
