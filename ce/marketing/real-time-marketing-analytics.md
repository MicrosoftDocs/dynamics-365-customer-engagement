Real-time marketing's dashboards and cross-journey insights present metrics, views, and insights summarized across single or multiple journeys, providing you with a deep understanding of journey, channel, and content performance. The built-in dashboards focus on engagement goals, so you can fine-tune the effectiveness of your journeys, channels, and content.

With real-time marketing analytics, you can:

- Evaluate the effectiveness of journeys against your objectives.
- Troubleshoot journeys by identifying areas of friction.
- Discover what is working so that you can amplify or recreate the same approach elsewhere.
- Understand the effectiveness of various channels of communication.

## Journey operational analytics

Evaluate journey performance in near real-time through built in operational analytics. The Sankey view in the designer helps you understand the user flow through the journey to understand which branches are working well.

Select any component to view near real-time operational analytics in the right pane, including:

- **Goal analytics**: If a goal has been defined a target set, you can view how the journey is progressing towards its goal and if it has met the goal.
- **Channel analytics**: For any message in the journey (email/text/push notification), view the delivery funnel and additional metrics to diagnose the content performance.
- **AI optimization**: Near real-time data to help you evaluate how applying AI optimization has helped your engagement rate.
