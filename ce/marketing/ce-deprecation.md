# Deprecation: Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement

[!INCLUDE[consolidated-sku-rtm-only](../includes/consolidated-sku-rtm-only.md)]

In October 2019, Microsoft deprecated the *Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement* SKU/license plan. Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement included the following Dynamics 365 apps and their related services:

- Dynamics 365 Marketing
- Dynamics 365 Sales
- Dynamics 365 Customer Service
- Dynamics 365 Field Service
- Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation

> [!NOTE]
> Under the Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement SKU/license plan, customers were allowed to use Marketing if they had at least 10 seats of either the CRM or ERP applications.

As of 2022, Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement licenses purchased prior to the deprecation began expiring. Licenses for the current customer engagement apps may be purchased individually. Learn more: [Dynamics 365 pricing](/dynamics365/licensing/update).
