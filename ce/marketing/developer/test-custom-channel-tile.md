# Step 4: Test your custom channel tile

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

To make the custom channel tile available in the customer journey designer:

1. Create a solution. More information: [Create a solution](../../customize/create-solution.md)
2. Add the tile CSS file as a **Style Sheet (CSS)** web resource to the solution you created. Note the generated file name as the name will contain publisher prefix (for example, sample_). This file name needs to be used in the tile XML file. More information: [Create or edit web resources to extend a web application](../../customize/create-edit-web-resources.md)
3. Add the tile XML file as a **Data (XML)** web resource to the solution you created. The file name must end with 'CustomerJourneyDesignerTileConfig.xmlâ€™.
4. Save the solution and publish all customizations.
5. Create a customer journey to open the customer journey designer. Go to **Marketing** > **Marketing Execution** > **Customer Journeys**, and then select **New**. For more information about creating a journey, see [Create a simple customer journey](../../marketing/create-simple-customer-journey.md).
    
    The tile should show up in the **Custom Content** section of the tile library in the customer journey designer.
