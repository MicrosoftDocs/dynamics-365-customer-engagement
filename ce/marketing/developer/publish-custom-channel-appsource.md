# Publish custom channel on AppSource

Once you have your custom code (plug-in or workflow), tile, and custom entities/forms tested and ready for the custom channel, you can publish it on [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com) from where users can download and install it in their Dynamics 365 Marketing instance. 

To do so, add all the components for the custom channel in a solution, and then publish it on Microsoft AppSource. For detailed information about publishing apps on AppSource, see [Publish your app on AppSource](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/publish-app-appsource).
