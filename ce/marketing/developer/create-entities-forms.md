# Step 1: Create required entities and forms for custom channel

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

You might want to create custom entities and forms to store and display information about your custom channel. You might also want to build a configuration page to help users connect to an external service that your custom channel interacts with. Finally, you could build some dashboards to display some analytics information.

- [Create or edit entities (record types)](../../customize/create-edit-entities.md)
- [Create and design forms](../../customize/create-design-forms.md)
- [Create or edit dashboards](../../customize/create-edit-dashboards.md)

> [!NOTE]
> You can view all the entities and their properties, attributes, and relationships by using the Entity Metadata Browser tool. More information: [Dynamics 365 for Marketing entity reference](marketing-entity-reference.md)
