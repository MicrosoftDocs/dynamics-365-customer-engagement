# MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS<br>PROJECT SERVICE SOLUTION HEALTH HUB

These license terms are an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (or
one of its affiliates). They apply to the software named above and any Microsoft
services or software updates (except to the extent such services or updates are
accompanied by new or additional terms, in which case those different terms
apply prospectively and do not alter your or Microsoft’s rights relating to
pre-updated software or services). IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU
HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW. BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS.

**1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.**

>   **a) General.** You may install and use any number of copies of the software
>   on your devices for your use solely with Project Service Solution Health
>   Hub.
>
>   **b) Third Party Software.** The software may include third party
>   applications that Microsoft, not the third party, licenses to you under this
>   agreement. Any included notices for third party applications are for your
>   information only.

**2. DATA**

>   **a) Data Collection.** The software may collect information about you and
>   your use of the software and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this
>   information to provide services and improve Microsoft’s products and
>   services. Your opt-out rights, if any, are described in the product
>   documentation. Some features in the software may enable collection of data
>   from users of your applications that access or use the software. If you use
>   these features to enable data collection in your applications, you must
>   comply with applicable law, including getting any required user consent, and
>   maintain a prominent privacy policy that accurately informs users about how
>   you use, collect, and share their data. You can learn more about Microsoft’s
>   data collection and use in the product documentation and the Microsoft
>   Privacy Statement at <https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=512132>. You
>   agree to comply with all applicable provisions of the Microsoft Privacy
>   Statement.
>
>   **b) Processing of Personal Data.** To the extent Microsoft is a processor
>   or subprocessor of personal data in connection with the software, Microsoft
>   makes the commitments in the European Union General Data Protection
>   Regulation Terms of the Online Services Terms to all customers effective May
>   25, 2018, at <https://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9840733>.

**3. SCOPE OF LICENSE.** The software is licensed, not sold. Microsoft reserves
all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this
limitation, you will not (and have no right to):

>   **a)** work around any technical limitations in the software that only allow
>   you to use it in certain ways;
>
>   **b)** reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software;
>
>   **c)** remove, minimize, block, or modify any notices of Microsoft or its
>   suppliers in the software;
>
>   **d)** use the software in any way that is against the law or to create or
>   propagate malware; or
>
>   **e)** share, publish, distribute, or lend the software (except for any
>   distributable code, subject to the terms above), provide the software as a
>   stand-alone hosted solution for others to use, or transfer the software or
>   this agreement to any third party.

**4. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.** You must comply with all domestic and international
export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include
restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further information on
export restrictions, visit <https://aka.ms/exporting>.

**5. SUPPORT SERVICES.** Microsoft is not obligated under this agreement to
provide any support services for the software. Any support provided is “as is”,
“with all faults”, and without warranty of any kind.

**6. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.** This agreement, and any other terms Microsoft may
provide for supplements, updates, or third-party applications, is the entire
agreement for the software.

**7. APPLICABLE LAW AND PLACE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES.** If you acquired the
software in the United States or Canada, the laws of the state or province where
you live (or, if a business, where your principal place of business is located)
govern the interpretation of this agreement, claims for its breach, and all
other claims (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort
claims), regardless of conflict of laws principles. If you acquired the software
in any other country, its laws apply. If U.S. federal jurisdiction exists, you
and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal court
in King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court. If not, you and
Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior Court of
King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court.

**8. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS.** This agreement describes certain
legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the
laws of your state or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with
Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you
acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the
laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you
acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law
applies, then the following provisions apply to you:

>   **a) Australia.** You have statutory guarantees under the Australian
>   Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those
>   rights.
>
>   **b) Canada.** If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop
>   receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting
>   your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet,
>   however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or
>   uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also
>   specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software.
>
>   **c) Germany and Austria.**
>
>>   **i. Warranty.** The properly licensed software will perform substantially
>>   as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software.
>>   However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the
>>   licensed software.
>>
>>   **ii. Limitation of Liability.** In case of intentional conduct, gross
>>   negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in case
>>   of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to
>>   the statutory law.
>>
>>   Subject to the foregoing clause ii., Microsoft will only be liable for
>>   slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual
>>   obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this
>>   agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement
>>   and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called
>>   "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will
>>   not be liable for slight negligence.

**9. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK
OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS.
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES ALL IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND
NON-INFRINGEMENT.**

**10. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. IF YOU HAVE ANY BASIS FOR
RECOVERING DAMAGES DESPITE THE PRECEDING DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY, YOU CAN RECOVER
FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. \$5.00. YOU
CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS,
SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.**

**This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services,
content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party
applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, warranty, guarantee, or
condition; strict liability, negligence, or other tort; or any other claim; in
each case to the extent permitted by applicable law.**

**It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the
possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to
you because your state, province, or country may not allow the exclusion or
limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages.**
