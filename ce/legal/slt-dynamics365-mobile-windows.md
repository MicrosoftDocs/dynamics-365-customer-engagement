======================================================================================================================================

These license terms are an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (or
one of its affiliates). They apply to the software named above and any Microsoft
services or software updates (except to the extent such services or updates are
accompanied by new or additional terms, in which case those different terms
apply prospectively and do not alter your or Microsoft’s rights relating to
pre-updated software or services). IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU
HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW. BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS.

**1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.**

>   **a. Installation and Use.** You may install and use any number of copies of
>   the software on your devices running the Windows 8 and its successive
>   versions (collectively, “Windows”) operating system and which are affiliated
>   with the Microsoft account associated with your Windows Store account for
>   your use solely with the following Microsoft applications or services:
> 
> >   • Microsoft Dynamics 365 for phones and Microsoft Dynamics 365 for tablets apps that support model-driven apps, such as Dynamics 365 Sales and Dynamics 365 Customer Service, built on Common Data Service

**2. DATA COLLECTION.** The software may collect information about you and your
use of the software and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this
information to provide services and improve Microsoft’s products and services.
Your opt-out rights, if any, are described in the product documentation. Some
features in the software may enable collection of data from users of your
applications that access or use the software. If you use these features to
enable data collection in your applications, you must comply with applicable
law, including getting any required user consent, and maintain a prominent
privacy policy that accurately informs users about how you use, collect, and
share their data. You can learn more about Microsoft’s data collection and use
in the product documentation and the Microsoft Privacy Statement at
<http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=521839>. You agree to comply with all
applicable provisions of the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

**3. Processing of Personal Data.** To the extent Microsoft is a processor or
subprocessor of personal data in connection with the software, Microsoft makes
the commitments in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation Terms
of the Online Services Terms to all customers effective May 25, 2018, at
<http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9840733>.

**4. SCOPE OF LICENSE.** The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only
gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights.
Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use
the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you
must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you
to use it in certain ways. You may not

>   • work around any technical limitations in the software;
> 
>   • reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and only
>   to the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this
>   limitation;
> 
>   • make more copies of the software than specified in this agreement or
>   allowed by applicable law, despite this limitation;
> 
>   • publish the software for others to copy;
> 
>   • rent, lease or lend the software;
> 
>   • transfer the software or this agreement to any third party; or
> 
>   • use the software for commercial software hosting services.

**5. DOCUMENTATION.** You may copy and use the documentation for your internal,
reference purposes.

**6. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.** The software is subject to United States export laws
and regulations. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws
and regulations that apply to the software. These laws include restrictions on
destinations, end users and end use. For additional information, visit
(aka.ms/exporting).

**7. SUPPORT SERVICES.** Microsoft is not obligated under this agreement to
provide any support services for the software. Any support provided is “as is”,
“with all faults”, and without warranty of any kind. If you have any issues with
this software or questions about your use, including questions about your
company’s privacy policy, please contact your company’s IT Administrator. Do not
contact Microsoft, the application store owner, your network operator, or device
manufacturer.

**8. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.** This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates,
Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire
agreement for the software and support services.

**9. APPLICABLE LAW.**

>   **a. United States.** If you acquired the software in the United States,
>   Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and
>   applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws
>   principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims,
>   including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition
>   laws, and in tort.
> 
>   **b. Outside the United States.** If you acquired the software in any other
>   country, the laws of that country apply.

**10. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS.** This agreement describes certain
legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the
laws of your state, province, or country. Separate and apart from your
relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party
from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other
rights if the laws of your state, province, or country do not permit it to do
so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or
mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:

>   **a) Australia.** You have statutory guarantees under the Australian
>   Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those
>   rights.
> 
>   **b) Canada.** If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop
>   receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting
>   your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet,
>   however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or
>   uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also
>   specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software.
> 
>   **c) Germany and Austria.**
> 
> >  (i) **Warranty.** The properly licensed software will perform substantially
> >   as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software.
> >   However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the
> >   licensed software.
> > 
> >  (ii) **Limitation of Liability.** In case of intentional conduct, gross
> >   negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in case
> >   of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to
> >   the statutory law.
> > 
> >  Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only be liable for
> >   slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual
> >   obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this
> >   agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement
> >   and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called
> >   "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will
> >   not be liable for slight negligence.

**11. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS IS.” YOU BEAR THE
RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR
CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES
ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.**

**12. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. IF YOU HAVE ANY BASIS FOR
RECOVERING DAMAGES DESPITE THE PRECEDING DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY, YOU CAN RECOVER
FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. \$5.00. YOU
CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS,
SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.**

**This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services,
content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party
applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, warranty, guarantee, or
condition; strict liability, negligence, or other tort; or any other claim; in
each case to the extent permitted by applicable law.**

**It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the
possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to
you because your state, province, or country may not allow the exclusion or
limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages.**
