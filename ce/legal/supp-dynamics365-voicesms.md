Updated: October 2020

**1. Applicability.** These Supplemental Terms govern the:

>   (i) use by you and any of your authorized users of the public switched
>   telephone network (“PSTN”) voice and/or messaging services provided by
>   Microsoft (or based on where you are located, one of its affiliates or other
>   entity authorized to provide the services) (“Microsoft”) via the Azure
>   Communication Services platform (“ACS” and collectively, “Microsoft
>   Supplemental Services”), and
>
>   (ii) access by you and any of your authorized users of the PSTN voice and/or
>   messaging services provided directly to you by third parties that you access
>   through the Microsoft Dynamics 365 software or Microsoft Dynamics 365 online
>   services and that are subject to those third-party terms and charges
>   (“Third-Party Supplemental Services”).

The term “you” also includes validly authorized users of your organization. The
term “Third-Parties” refers to the providers of the Third-Party Supplemental
Services. The term “Supplemental Services” refers collectively to the Microsoft
Supplemental Services and the Third-Party Supplemental Services.

**GENERAL TERMS**

**2. Agreement, Billing and Support for Third-Party Supplemental Services.**
Microsoft Dynamics 365 software and online services interface with Third Parties
through a Microsoft API connector so that you may access those Third-Party
Supplemental Services. To use Third-Party Supplemental Services through this
connector, you must enter into an agreement directly with the Third-Party for
such services. Microsoft is not the provider of, and does not manage billing or
support for, any such Third-Party Supplemental Services. You will address all
billing, support, and other issues relating to a Third-Party Supplemental
Service directly with the provider of such service. Your use of the Third-Party
Supplemental Service is governed by separate terms between you and the provider
of the Third-Party Supplemental Service.

**3. Software and Online Service License.** You may use the Microsoft
Supplemental Services, or the Third-Party Supplemental Services, with each
validly licensed copy of Microsoft Dynamics 365 software (“Software”), or each
validly licensed subscription to Microsoft Dynamics 365 online services (“Online
Services”), for which the Microsoft Supplemental Services, or Third-Party
Supplemental Services, are offered. You may not use the Microsoft Supplemental
Services, or Third-Party Supplemental Services, in conjunction with any Software
or Online Services if you do not have a license for that Software or Online
Service, or have not otherwise accepted all applicable terms of Microsoft and
Third-Parties. Your use of Software and Online Services is also subject to
applicable policies (including acceptable use policies) of ACS, Microsoft’s
service providers, receiving wireless carriers, and other third parties, such as
the Messaging Principles of CTIA – The Wireless Association. Access to or use of
certain functionality within the Supplemental Services may require additional
licenses for other software and online services, which may also require you to
pay an additional fee.

**4. Emergency Services.** You will not attempt to use outbound voice
functionalities of the Supplemental Services to access or allow access to
official, government-sponsored emergency telephone numbers (such as 911 or 112)
which is used to dispatch professional emergency responders (“Emergency
Services”) unless the specific Supplemental Service to which you have subscribed
is expressly approved by Microsoft for Emergency Services. NEITHER MICROSOFT NOR
ITS REPRESENTATIVES WILL BE LIABLE UNDER ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY FOR ANY
CLAIM, DAMAGE, OR LOSS (AND YOU WILL HOLD MICROSOFT HARMLESS AGAINST ANY AND ALL
SUCH CLAIMS) ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THE INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES TO
CONTACT EMERGENCY SERVICES. NO OUTBOUND VOICE FUNCTIONALITY OF ANY SUPPLEMENTAL
SERVICE SHOULD BE USED FOR CONTACTING EMERGENCY SERVICES, UNLESS THE SERVICE IS
EXPRESSLY APPROVED FOR THIS PURPOSE.

**5. Data Sharing.** By using the Third-Party Supplemental Services, you consent
to your data being shared with the Third-Parties and to your data flowing
outside of your organization’s compliance and geographic location boundaries.
This includes government cloud environments. You can find more information in
the technical documentation from Microsoft and Third-Parties and the Microsoft
Privacy Statement at <https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=512132>.

**6. Messaging Activities.** You acknowledge that with respect to your use of
any PSTN messaging services, including any messaging features provided as part
of the Supplemental Services, you control and are responsible for, and Microsoft
does not determine, the (a) message content sent to recipients, (b) selection of
message recipients, (c) decision on whether or when to send such messages, (d)
actual sending of the messages, or (e) obtaining or retaining any necessary
consents to send such messages. Microsoft has no involvement in the foregoing
actions, or your use of any messaging services, including any messaging services
provided by Microsoft or Third-Parties, other than providing you with the
software, the online service, and access to any Third-Party Supplemental
Services for which you must enter into terms directly with the Third-Party.

**7. No Resale.** These Supplemental Terms do not authorize you to resell the
Supplemental Services (i.e., selling just the Supplemental Services without you
materially adding functionalities as part of your products and services). You
may only integrate the Supplemental Services into your products and services as
permitted by these and other applicable terms, but such products and services
may not consist of you merely rebranding the Supplemental Services and selling
such rebranded services under your name, tradename, or mark without you adding
material functionalities that differ from voice and text services. In addition
to any other remedies Microsoft may have, if you breach this provision and
resell the Supplemental Services, you – not Microsoft - are responsible for
complying with the regulatory requirements, fees, and taxes applicable to your
resale.

**8. Taxes and Fees.** You are responsible for the payment of all federal, state
and local taxes, fees, charges, telecommunications provider (e.g., carrier)
surcharges or other similar exactions, or taxes applicable to your products and
services that incorporate or otherwise use the Supplemental Services, as well as
the payment of any taxes and regulatory fees that any Third-Parties may charge
you.

**9. Acceptable Use.** In addition to the acceptable use provisions under your
license terms for the Software or Online Services, neither you, nor those that
access the Software, Online Services, or Supplemental Services through you, may
use the Supplemental Services in connection with (a) an automatic telephone
dialing system or other device with the capability to dial random or sequential
numbers; (b) expanding a transactional communication to include unconsented
promotional or marketing content whether directly in the body of the
transactional communication, accessible through a hyperlink contained in the
body of the transactional communication, or via any other indirect method; (c)
sending messages in a volume broadcast, including sending the same message or
similar messages to multiple recipients within a relatively short period of
time; (d) sending multiple messages exceeding the express or implied scope of
the end user’s initial consent; and (e) sending messages to recipients without
first obtaining prior consent from the recipient as required by applicable law.

**10. Term and Termination rights.** The term of these Supplemental Terms
("Term") begins when you agree to these terms or otherwise begin to use the
Supplemental Services, and continues until terminated or until Microsoft
terminates all access to the Supplemental Services, whichever occurs first.

or no reason. Microsoft may also terminate or suspend these Supplemental Terms,
in whole or part, immediately on notice if you breach these Supplemental Terms
