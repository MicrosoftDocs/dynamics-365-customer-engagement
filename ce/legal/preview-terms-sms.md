# Preview terms for TeleSign SMS in Omni-Channel Engagement Hub 

Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”) is pleased to work with you in connection with the preview described herein, the first of which is the public preview for Dynamics 365 Omni-Channel Engagement Hub (“OC Preview”), and the second of which is a preview for interface of certain SMS services (“SMS Services”) provided by TeleSign Corporation (“TeleSign”) with the Omni-channel preview, referred to herein as the “TeleSign Preview.”  The Omni-channel preview and the TeleSign Preview may be referred to individually hereunder, or collectively as the “Previews.”  The term of the TeleSign Preview will begin from the time you enable the SMS Services with Omni-Channel Engagement Hub and shall continue, unless terminated hereunder, until the SMS Services become commercially released and generally available (“TeleSign Preview Term”).

1. **Relation to the Microsoft Dynamics Insider Program Agreement**.  The Previews are subject to the terms and conditions of the Microsoft Dynamics Insider Program Agreement, which you confirm your agreement to by accepting these Preview Terms.  These Preview Terms constitute “Preview Terms” under the DIPA.  Any capitalized terms in these Preview Terms not otherwise defined herein will have the meaning given such terms in the DIPA.  In the event of a conflict between the provisions of these Preview Terms and the DIPA, the provisions of these Preview Terms shall control and supersede.

2. **Relationship between the Previews and the SMS Services**.  You acknowledge that: (a) the Previews do not include the SMS Services, but interface through APIs with the SMS Services; (b)  TeleSign, and not Microsoft, is the sole and exclusive provider of the SMS Services to you; and, (c) TeleSign, and not Microsoft, is responsible for ensuring that the SMS Services, and your use of them, are compliant with all applicable laws, including, but not limited to, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”), the Communications Act, the Telecommunications Act, regulations, rules, or agency interpretation thereof and any other applicable law, rule, regulation, and agency interpretation (“Applicable Laws”).  

3. **TeleSign Terms**.  Accordingly, you will enter into trial terms, general terms of service, privacy commitments and any billing arrangements for the SMS Services directly with TeleSign and you shall comply with such obligations in all respects.  Any breach by you of the TeleSign terms shall, at Microsoft’s choice, result in termination or suspension of the Previews for breach upon written notice, effective as of the giving of such notice.  Microsoft shall have no support obligations, or any liability, to you or the recipients of your messages, for any reason in connection with the SMS Services.  Regardless of the term of your subscription for the SMS Services, you may use the SMS Services in connection with the Omni-channel Preview only during the TeleSign Preview Term.  The SMS Services, in connection with the Previews, make use of your Dynamics instance as the backend storage of content related to the SMS Services.  Any use of the data that comes into and is stored by your Dynamics instance as specified hereunder is deemed to be your Customer Data under your applicable Microsoft agreement therefor.  

4. **Microsoft’s Limitation of Responsibility**.  You acknowledge that you, and not Microsoft, have full responsibility for: (a) all creation and selection of content in any message that you send; (b) any decision of who to send messages to; and, (c) whether and when messages will be sent, as well as actual sending of all messages.  Any tools provided by Microsoft are for your enablement to exercise your choice in the foregoing actions and you agree that Microsoft shall have no liability in relation thereto.

5. **Data Sharing**.  By using the SMS Services, you consent to your data being shared with TeleSign and to your data flowing outside of your organization’s compliance boundary, even if your organization is in a Government Cloud environment.  For more information, please consult the [feature documentation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2086930)  and the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839&clcid=0x409).

6. **Permissible Use of the SMS Services in connection with the Preview**.  During the TeleSign Preview Term, you may not use the SMS Services: (a) in a “live” or production environment, i.e. to receive and send SMS messages with your customers or any other third party; (b) in connection with a device that possesses actual auto-dialing capabilities, e.g. dialing of random or sequential numbers; (c) in any way that would violate the acceptable use provisions of the DIPA or any Microsoft agreement applicable to your use of Dynamics; (d) in any way that violates Applicable Laws; (e) to send any promotional or marketing SMS messages, including, but not limited to, expansion of any transactional SMS message to include unconsented promotional or marketing content, e.g., by direct addition of unconsented promotional content in a message or by adding or making promotional content accessible through a link to a website in a message, or any other indirect method; (f) to send messages in a volume broadcast, e.g., the same message or similar messages to multiple recipients within a relatively short period of time; (g) to send messages to recipients who have not first sent you a message, i.e., messages must be initiated by your customer and only then responded to; (h) to send, after initial consent to receiving a message, multiple messages exceeding such express or implied scope of consent; or (i) without first ensuring that anyone using the SMS Services possesses the requisite level of prior express consent of the recipient before transmitting to that recipient.

7. **Disclaimer of Warranties**. IN ADDITION TO ANY DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES UNDER THE DIPA OR YOUR APPLICABLE MICROSOFT AGREEMENT, MICROSOFT MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY REGARDING THE SMS SERVICES OR THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE SMS SERVICES AND THE PREVIEWS OR YOUR DYNAMICS INSTANCE.  ACCORDINGLY, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT POSSIBLE BY LAW, MICROSOFT DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE FOREGOING, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. THIS ALSO INCLUDES ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY ARISING FROM COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, COURSE OF DEALING, OR USAGE OF TRADE.

8. **Indemnification**. You will indemnify, defend, and hold Microsoft and its officers, directors, employees, contractors, affiliates, and agents harmless from any and all claims, suits, demands, enforcement actions, costs, liabilities, expenses, and damages (including reasonable attorneys’ costs and fees) (collectively, “Claim”) related to your:   

    1. Breach of any obligations or restrictions under these Preview Terms (including, but not limited to, provisions regarding permissible use in Section 5 above), under the DIPA (including, but not limited to, provisions regarding acceptable use in Section 2(d) thereof), or your applicable Microsoft agreement for use of your Dynamics instance in connection with the SMS Services; 
    2. use of the SMS Services; or,
    3. gross negligence or willful acts or omissions relating to any of your obligations under these Preview Terms. 

    When seeking indemnification, Microsoft will promptly: 

      1. Notify you in writing of any such Claim; 
      2. Allow you to assume sole control of the defense or settlement of such Claim with counsel of your choice and at your sole expense; and 
      3. Give you all necessary information and assistance (as it may reasonably request and at your sole expense) to defend and settle such Claim. 

    Microsoft may retain counsel of its choosing and participate in the defense or settlement of any Claim at its sole expense.  You will not settle any claim on Microsoft’s behalf, or publicize the settlement, without Microsoft’s prior written consent.  

9. **Termination**. Either party may terminate these Preview Terms for breach, effective upon written notice of the same.  Microsoft may terminate at-will, effective upon written notice of the same.  The provisions of Sections 1-4 and 7-10 of these Preview Terms will survive any expiration or termination hereof.

10. **Integration**. These Preview Terms, the DIPA and your Microsoft agreement applicable to your use of Dynamics constitute the complete agreement between us of the subject matter hereof and merges and extinguishes all other prior or contemporaneous agreements, whether written or oral.  The General provisions of Section 11 of the DIPA apply to these Preview Terms.
