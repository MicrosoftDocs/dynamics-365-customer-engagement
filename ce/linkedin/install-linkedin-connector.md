# Install [!include[Dynamics 365 Connector for LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms](../includes/cc-linkedin-solution.md)] from AppSource

To enable the synchronization of lead data from [!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] to [!include[Dynamics 365](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)], a system administrator needs to install [!include[Dynamics 365 Connector for LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms](../includes/cc-linkedin-solution.md)] from [Microsoft AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=850928).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can benefit from this connector when you use [!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] advertising campaigns that generate leads, such as [Sponsored Content](https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/native-advertising/), [Sponsored InMail](https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/sponsored-inmail), or [Dynamic Ads](https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/dynamic-ads).

## Prerequisites

* To install, update, or remove the solution, youâ€™ll need global admin permissions in Office 365, and be a system administrator or have a customizer security role in [!include[Dynamics 365 (online)](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)].

* The capabilities in this solution require at least the [!include[December update for Microsoft Dynamics 365 (online)](../includes/pn-crm-8-2-0-online.md)].

* To sync leads from [!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] and run campaigns on [!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)], you need access to a [!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Advertising Account that can manage ads by using [!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Campaign Manager.    
  More information: [LinkedIn: Campaign Manager Overview](https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/56969), [LinkedIn: Creating an Account for Campaigns](https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/topics/8121/8122/5749), [LinkedIn: Adding, Editing, and Removing User Permissions on Advertising Accounts](https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/5753)

* We recommend using the latest version of [!include[Edge](../includes/pn-microsoft-edge.md)], [!include[Chrome](../includes/tn-google-chrome.md)], [!include[Firefox](../includes/tn-mozilla-firefox.md)], or [!include[Safari](../includes/tn-apple-safari.md)].

## Download and install the solution from AppSource

First, an administrator needs to install the solution.

1. Get the app package from [Microsoft AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=850928).

2. Sign in to your [!include[Dynamics 365 (online)](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] system admin account.

3. Select **Get** to start installing the solution.

4. Review and accept the disclaimer, required permissions, and service terms to install [!include[Dynamics 365 Connector for LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms](../includes/cc-linkedin-solution.md)] to [!include[Dynamics 365 (online)](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)]. You need to be a global admin in this Office 365 tenant to authorize S2S inbound. More information about S2S: [MSDN: Build web applications using Server-to-Server (S2S) authentication](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt790168.aspx)  
   It takes a few minutes to install the solution. To monitor the status of the installation, or update or remove a managed solution, go to the [Office 365 admin center](https://portal.office.com/).
   More information: [TechNet: Use the Office 365 admin center to manage your Dynamics 365 (online) subscription in Dynamics 365](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn973004.aspx).

6. The solution creates two new security roles, which you assign to users so they can work with [!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Lead Gen Forms in [!include[Dynamics 365](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)]. A third role, **LinkedIn Lead Gen S2S Inbound**, is an internal security role used by the solution to sync data.

* **[!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Lead Gen Forms Administrator**&mdash;Users with this role can configure lead matching strategies, [!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] field mapping, and solution settings for [!include[Dynamics 365 Connector for LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms](../includes/cc-linkedin-solution.md)].

* **[!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Lead Gen Forms Salesperson**&mdash;These users can authorize [!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] user profiles to sync data to [!include[Dynamics 365](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)], and view details about the synced submissions.

Assign these security roles to users you want to provide access to the **[!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Lead Gen** menu item in [!include[Dynamics 365 (online)](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)]. To learn how to assign a security role to users, see [TechNet: Create users and assign Microsoft Dynamics 365 (online) security roles](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj191623.aspx#BKMK_AssignSecurity).
