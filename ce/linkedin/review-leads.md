# Analyze leads and lead performance

When a [!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] lead matches a lead record in [!include[Dynamics 365 (online)](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)], the lead record is updated with additional information. In addition to the updates of individual lead records, charts on dashboards can represent the performance of a marketing campaign on [!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)].

## See the details of a lead

To see the details of a lead record in [!include[Dynamics 365](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)], go to **Sales** > **Leads** and select the lead record from the list. If the lead was created by [!include[Dynamics 365 Connector for LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms](../includes/cc-linkedin-solution.md)], the lead source is **[!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Sponsored Content**. If an existing lead record was updated, [!include[Dynamics 365](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)] updates the lead field values by using the information submitted by the lead on [!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)].
More information about creating or editing a lead: [Dynamics 365 Help & Training: Create or edit a lead](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p?linkid=832163).

1. Information about the lead from [!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)]
2. Source from which the lead originated and the [!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] campaign related to this lead
3. Forms submitted by this lead

## Review the aggregated lead performance

Work with a dashboard containing charts about the source of new leads, or create new dashboards by using the charts that matter the most to get your reporting completed.</br>

When you create your own dashboard, consider adding a chart for the record type **[!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Form Submissions** to see how your campaigns perform compared to each other. Or, you can create a **Leads by Source** chart for the record type **Lead**. Give it a try!

## Analyze individual LinkedIn Lead Gen forms and submissions

To see all form submissions in [!include[Dynamics 365 (online)](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)], go to **Sales** > **[!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Lead Gen** > **[!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Form Submissions**. You can drill down to individual submissions to see the details of the lead and the information provided by the [!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] members when they answered the underlying [!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Lead Gen form.
