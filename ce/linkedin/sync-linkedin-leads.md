# How to sync [!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] leads by using [!include[Dynamics 365 Connector for LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms](../includes/cc-linkedin-solution.md)]

[!include[Pre-release disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

[!include[Dynamics 365 Connector for LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms](../includes/cc-linkedin-solution.md)] enables seamless synchronization of [!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] leads to [!include[Dynamics 365](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)]. [!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] members can drive leads from [Sponsored Content](https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/native-advertising) campaigns, based on a variety of calls to action. The [!include[LinkedIn Connector](../includes/pn-linkedin-solution-shortest.md)] lets campaign managers sync the leads from [LinkedIn's Lead Gen forms](https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/native-advertising/lead-gen-ads) to a [!include[Dynamics 365 (online)](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] instance for further nurturing. If a lead is already known in [!include[Dynamics 365](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)], the data for that lead will be updated by using the information provided from [!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)]; otherwise, a new lead record is created in [!include[Dynamics 365](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)].

> [!NOTE]
> You need a [!include[Dynamics 365 (online)](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] organization with the Sales app to use the [!include[LinkedIn Connector](../includes/pn-linkedin-solution-shortest.md)].

## Quick start guide to install and use the connector

1. A [!include[Dynamics 365 (online)](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] system administrator or customizer installs the [Connector for LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms from Microsoft AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=850928).

2. Optionally, a campaign manager defines the matching strategy between [!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] leads and [!include[Dynamics 365 (online)](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] lead records, and analyzes individual forms and submissions.

3. A person filling the roles of both a campaign manager on [!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] and a salesperson in [!include[Dynamics 365](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)] authorizes [!include[Dynamics 365](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)] to receive data from [!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)].

4. Optionally, a sales manager can review the lead performance in a [!include[Dynamics 365 (online)](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] dashboard.
