> [!IMPORTANT]
> With the release of the Customer Service admin center app that consolidates admin experiences across the Customer Service suite, we announce that the following admin experiences are deprecated and no longer supported after April 2023.
>
> - Service Management area in the Customer Service Hub app
> - Omnichannel admin center
> - **App profile manager:** Is removed in April 2023.
>
> Also, starting in October 2022, the Omnichannel admin center and the service management area in Customer Service Hub will be hidden by default in newly created organizations and environments. You have the option to bring them back, but we recommend that you start using the Customer Service admin center app to perform tasks like manage cases, and configure unified routing, channels, and agent experience profiles.
