For information about where your Microsoft Dynamics 365 Marketing data is stored, please refer to the [Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/TrustCenter/Privacy/dynamics365-marketing).

### Microsoft Azure services
Microsoft Dynamics 365 Marketing leverages certain Microsoft Azure services.  Enabling Dynamics 365 Marketing allows your data to flow to the Azure services to perform some of the marketing processes.

For more information about Azure service offerings, see the [Azure Trust Center](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/trusted-cloud/).

### Custom schema and display names

Custom schema and display names for fields, entities, relations, attributes, and other elements in Dynamics 365 Marketing may be referenced by other object definitions, and can also get shared through various other channels that are outside your designated geographic location (geo) as described in the [Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/TrustCenter/Privacy/dynamics365-marketing) and the [Microsoft Online Services Terms](https://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/DocumentSearch.aspx?Mode=3&DocumentTypeId=46&ShowArchived=true).  However, the data entered for these elements will not be transferred outside your geo.

For example, you could use the customization capabilities of Dynamics 365 Marketing to create a new entity that includes a new field, as shown in the following table.  In this case, the texts shown in the **Schema name** and **Display name** columns could be referenced by other object definitions and could also be shared through various other channels that are outside your geo.  However, field values for specific records (as shown in the **Value** column) will remain within your geo.

| Type | Schema name | Display name | Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| New entity | Solution1_promotion | Promotion | (n/a) |
| New field | Solution1_Promtion.name | Name | Spring 2019 Promotion |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not enter information for your custom schema and/or display name that you do not want stored outside your geo.

### Other examples of when you take responsibility for data flows

On your command, the following actions take customer content out of Dynamics 365 Marketing and you are responsible for where the data is directed and stored (including outside your geo location):

- When you send email with customer content
- When you use submissions forms and allow prefilling with customer content that will be displayed in the forms
- When you configure marketing analytics connectors to copy interaction data to your own Azure storage
- When you configure additional extension mechanics

For more information on data that will flow out of the Dynamics 365 Marketing system and your geo, please refer to the [Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/TrustCenter/Privacy/dynamics365-marketing) as well as the product documentation for the specific Dynamics 365 Marketing offering.
