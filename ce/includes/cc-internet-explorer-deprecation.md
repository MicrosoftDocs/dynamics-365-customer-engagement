> - From October 31, 2022, Dynamics 365 Customer Service and Power Platform will be blocked in Internet Explorer. You'll receive a non-dismissible message mentioning why you're blocked and will be recommended to use Unified Service Desk on [Microsoft Edge WebView2](../unified-service-desk/edge-webview2-process.md). More information: [Support end for Internet Explorer](/power-platform/admin/support-end-internet-explorer) <br>
> For any questions, contact your Microsoft Customer Service representative or Microsoft Partner.
> - Because Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 is deprecated, the support for IE Process has also been discontinued in Unified Service Desk. To continue to use Unified Interface-based apps in Unified Service Desk, we recommend that you use the latest browser control host such as Edge WebView2.
