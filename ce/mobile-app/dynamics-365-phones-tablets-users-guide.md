![Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets change a chart view](media/ChageChartView_20.png "Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets change a chart view")

For example, tap "All Opportunities", then select a different view, both chart and grid will get refreshed.

## Search for records

You can search for records across multiple entities by using Relevance Search or Categorized Search. Relevance Search delivers fast and 
comprehensive results across multiple entities, in a single list, sorted by relevance. Categorized Search returns search results grouped 
by entity types, such as accounts, contacts or leads.

When Relevance Search is enabled for your organization, it becomes the default search experience.

**Switch between Relevance and Categorized search**

1. On the nav bar tap the Search button. 

   ![Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets search on nav bar](media/SearchOnNavBar_6.png "Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets search on nav bar")

2. From the menu, select a search type. 

   ![Switch between Relevance and Categorized search](media/SwitchBetweenCategorizedOrRelevanceSearch.png "Switch between Relevance and Categorized search")

**Use Relevance Search**

1.  On the nav bar tap Search button.

  ![Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets search on nav bar](media/SearchOnNavBar_6.png "Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets search on nav bar")

2.  Type in the search box, and then tap Search.

   ![Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets Relevance Search](media/RelevanceSearch.png "Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets Relevance Search")

Use syntax in your search term to get the results you want. For example, type “car silver 2-door” to include matches for any word in the search term in the search results. Type “car+silver+2-door” to find only matches that include all three words. Type “car|silver|2-door” to get results that contain “car” or “silver” or “2-door”, or all three words.

**Use Categorized Search**

1.  On the nav bar tap Search button.

  ![Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets search on nav bar](media/SearchOnNavBar_6.png "Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets search on nav bar")

2.  Type in the search box, and then tap Search.

![Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets search box](media/SeachBox_7.png "Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets search box")

Search results include only records that begin with the letters you type. For example, if you want to search for “Alpine Ski House,” type **alp** in the search box. If you type **ski**, the record won’t show up. 

![Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets enter search text](media/EnterSearchText_8.png "Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets enter search text")

**Filter search results**

To filter results by record type, choose a record type from the **Filter
with:** drop-down box.

![Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets filter search results](media/FilterSearchResults_9.png "Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets filter search results")

## Sort items in a grid view

To help you find a record quickly, you can sort items in a grid view. For example, when you’re looking at a list of your active accounts, tap the arrow to sort the records in ascending or descending order.

-   To sort in ascending order by a column, tap that column’s heading.

-   To sort in descending order, tap the column’s heading again.

  ![Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets sort items in grid view](media/Sort_Items_In_Grid_10.png "Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets sort items in grid view")
  
You can do the same from a list view in [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn-365_phones](../includes/pn-dyn-365-phones.md)]. 

 -   Tap ![Dynamics 365 ellipsis](../mobile-app/media/mobile-ellipsis.png "Dynamics 365 ellipsis"), tap **Sort** and then choose how you want to sort the data.
  
  ![Sort on phones](media/sortonphones.png "Sort on phones")

## Export records to Excel

In the list of records in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] mobile apps, you can export records to Microsoft Excel, just like you can in the web app. From a grid view in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] for tablets or a list of records in [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn-365_phones](../includes/pn-dyn-365-phones.md)] tap ![Dynamics 365 ellipsis](../mobile-app/media/mobile-ellipsis.png "Dynamics 365 ellipsis") on the command bar and then tap **Export to Excel**.

![Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets export to Excel](media/ExportToExcel_11.png "Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets export to Excel")

[!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Export data to excel](../basics/export-data-excel.md) 

## Relationship Assistant

The relationship assistant is designed to deliver the most important and relevant information in relation to what you are doing right now. The assistant works by analyzing all of the data at its disposal and generating a collection of action cards, each of which includes a message summarizing what the card is about, plus a set of links for taking action. The assistant sorts the cards by priority and filters them for your current context.

The assistant reminds you of upcoming activities; it evaluates your communications and suggests when it might be time to reach out to a contact that’s been inactive for a while; it identifies email messages that may be waiting for a reply from you; it alerts you when an opportunity is nearing its close date; and much more.

When you start your day by signing in to Dynamics 365, the assistant draws your attention to your most important items and tasks, drawn from all areas of the application.

1.  To access the assistant, on the nav bar, tap ![Dynamics 365 ellipsis](../mobile-app/media/mobile-ellipsis.png "Dynamics 365 ellipsis").

2.  Tap **Relationship Assistant**.

    ![Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets Relationship Assistant](media/RelationshipAssistant.png "Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets Relationship Assistant")

## Update your activities in the Timeline

The timeline view helps you collaborate with your team by tracking communication history on a single page in an easy-to-read 360 view.  
You can see everything from posts and voice attachments, to email and notes and more.

**Add an activity**

- Open a record and in the **Timeline** area, tap **+**, and select the type of activity that you want to add.

![Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets add an activity](media/AddActivity.png "Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets add an activity")

- Tap ![Dynamics 365 ellipsis](../mobile-app/media/mobile-ellipsis.png "Dynamics 365 ellipsis") and then tap **Open Filter Pane** to filter the records in the timeline by record type.

- Tap ![Sort timeline view](../mobile-app/media/sortbutton.png "Sort timeline view") to change the sort order for the records from ascending to descending and vice versa.

**Take notes**

The mobile app also lets you take notes and attach photos to a note, or take a new photo with your device's camera. So, if for example, you're out at a site and need to document a customer's issue with a product, you can capture and add it to a note right away, rather than taking the photo, then adding it from your camera roll later.

To add a note, open a record and in the notes area enter your note.

![Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets add picture to notes](media/AddPictureToNotes_16.png "Dynamics 365 for phones add picture to note")

### Scan barcodes  
Rather than manually typing a barcode number into a field, you can scan barcodes by using your device's camera. Tap the icon to the right of the field to start the scanner. This makes it easy to capture info about inventory and other issues when you're out in the field. You'll need to ask your admin to set this feature up for you.  

## Send an email or make a call
Call or send email to your customers easily from the mobile apps. Tap any phone number in a record to start a call, or tap the email button to send an email.

![Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets send an email or make a call](media/SendEmailOrMakeCall_23.png "Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets send an email or make a call")

In the [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn-365_tablets](../includes/pn-dyn-365-tablets.md)] app, tapping the phone button starts a Skype call. In [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn-365_phones](../includes/pn-dyn-365-phones.md)], it starts a phone call.

When you’re finished with your call, the app prompts you to enter details about
the call.
 
## Work offline 
Seamless work offline with mobile offline synchronization. You can work with mobile app in offline mode when the device is disconnected from the internet. The app provides a rich offline experience which lets you to work with basic commands like create, read, update, and delete and business processes - so you always stay productive. Once you're back online, changes you've made are synchronized with [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. 

When you're admin has enabled mobile offline, the next time that you access the mobile app, you will be prompted to download updates. Once you download the updates, you can start using the mobile app in offline mode.

1. When you see the **Offline Updates Available** dialog box, choose **Update**. 

  ![Download updates on your mobile device for mobile offline](media/DownloadUpdates.png "Download updates on your mobile device for mobile offline")
  
2. You'll see a progress indicator while the updates are being downloaded. When the download load is complete, it's a good idea to verify offline mode is available.

    ![Download updates progress bar](media/downloadingupdatesprogress.png "Download updates progress bar")


**See if offline mode is available**

When the updates have download, you can check to see if mobile offline is available.

1. From the nav bar, tap ![Dynamics 365 ellipsis](../mobile-app/media/mobile-ellipsis.png "Dynamics 365 ellipsis") and then tap, **Offline Status**.
  
   ![Mobile Offline Status](../mobile-app/media/OfflineStatusSettings.png "Mobile Offline Status")   

2. **Offline Status**, tracks offline status of the whole app, and also the status of each entity individually. When the status shows as  **Available**, it indicates offline is available and data has synced successfully.

 > [!NOTE] 
 > The status here can be **Not Available** due to an error or if you missed downlading offline updates. If the status is **Not Available** due to missing the latest offline updates, then try downloading the updates again.
 
 - **Entity Status**, provides the offline status of each entity individually. For the available entities you can also track the last time the entity synced.
 
    ![Mobile offline status](media/OfflineStatus.png "Mobile offline status")
 
 You can also track offline status of entities from the **Menu** ![Menu button](media/MenuButton.png "Menu button") button.

-  Green Wi-Fi icon next to the entity name indicates that it is available in offline mode.
-  Red Wi-Fi icon indicates that this entity is enabled for offline but is not available to work in offline mode due to an error or missing updates.
-  No Wi-Fi icon indicates that your admin has not enabled the entity to use in offline mode.

   ![Available entities for mobile offline](media/available_entites.png "Available entities for mobile offline")
  
**Background sync**

Background sync is enabled even when the app is minimized so long as a network connection is detected. But when the app is in the background, metadata changes will not be accepted automatically. 

Other things to keep in mind about background sync: 
  
-   Sync will run until you  sign in to the mobile app.    
  
-   While the app is running in the background, sync is automatically disabled when a network is disabled.  
  
-   When you bring the app to the  foreground, regular sync is detected and enabled.  
  
-   Background sync is disabled when the device is locked and enabled when the device is unlocked.  
  
-   While the app is running in the background,  metadata changes will not be accepted automatically. The mobile app will stop the background sync.  
  
-   When you bring the app to the  foreground, you are prompted to accept the metadata changes.  
  
-   While the app is running in the foreground, after metadata is updated, the app will switch to regular sync.  
  
 Background sync will be disabled if:  
  
-   Your user token expires in the background.  
  
-   The application closes for some reason.  
  
-   Your device locks.  
  
 Background sync is available on all supported devices. See [support for Dynamics 365 for phones and Dynamics 365 for tablets](../mobile-app/support-phones-tablets.md).  
 
**Sync conflict resolution** 

If multiple entries are made in the same field by offline users (for example, two or more “close by” dates), the conflict is clearly marked and you can choose the correct entry.  
  
If a record has changed on the server between the time your device retrieved the record and when it tries to update or delete that record,   you'll see an exclamation mark   ("!”) by the relevant field, and will need to resubmit your  updated changes.
 
## Reconfigure the app

If you used the mobile app on a phone or tablet temporarily and want to remove all you cache data before giving to device to someone else, you need reconfigure the app.

Reconfiguring deletes all data and metadata from the cache, though you shouldn't rely on this as a security measure.

If you sign out of one organization and sign in to another, and then use the **Reconfigure** option on the organization you signed in to, your metadata will still remain for the organization you signed out of. To remove your metadata from the organization you signed out of, you’ll need to sign in to it and use the **Reconfigure** option there, as well.

Here's how to do it:

1.  Tap ![Dynamics 365 ellipsis](../mobile-app/media/mobile-ellipsis.png "Dynamics 365 ellipsis").

2.  Tap **User Information**.

3.  Tap **Reconfigure**.
