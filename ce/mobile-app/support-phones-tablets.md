# What's supported

To do this, install the the Dynamics 365 for phones and Dynamics 365 for tablets mobile apps on your iOS, [!INCLUDE[tn_android](../includes/tn-android.md)]. 
  
## Supported devices for the mobile apps

|                              Platform                              |   Versions    | RAM (minimum)  |

## Supported tablets to run customer engagement apps in a web browser 

For full functionality and optimized experience, we strongly recommend that you use the Dynamics 365 mobile app. If you don't have the Dynamics 365 mobile app installed, you can  use the web browser on your tablet to run your apps as long as your device has sufficiently high screen resolution.

|       Apple iPad      | iOS 14 or later  |     9-inch screen (diagonal) or larger or iPad Mini with 7.9 inch screen      |
