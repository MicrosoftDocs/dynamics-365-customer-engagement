# What's supported

You can access Common Data Service or Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) data from mobile devices in different ways. You can install and use the Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets mobile app on your iOS, [!INCLUDE[tn_android](../includes/tn-android.md)], and Windows 10 devices, or you can use your tablet’s web browser to run the model-driven apps as long as your device has sufficiently high screen resolution.

## Install the app 

To install the app see, [Install the app from your device’s app store](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mobile-app/install-dynamics-365-for-phones-and-tablets#install-the-app-from-your-devices-app-store).

   

## Supported tablets to run model-driven apps in your web browser 

For full functionality and optimized experience, we strongly recommend that you use the Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets mobile app. If you don't have the Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets app installed, you can still use the web browser on your tablet to run the model-driven apps. 

> [!NOTE]
> Using the web browser on your phone to run your model-driven apps isn't supported; you must use the Dynamics 365 for phones app. 


### Supported tablets to use the web browser
  
|                              Platform                             |   Versions  | Minimum Resolution or Screen Size  | 
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|
|       Apple iPad      | iOS 11.4.1 or later  |     9-inch screen (diagonal) or larger or iPad Mini with 7.9 inch screen      |                                     |

Model-driven apps running on a web browser on an iOS or Android tablet provides a similar experience to using it with a web browser on your desktop or laptop computer. However, some features are not available on the mobile app or mobile web browser, including:
  
- Pinch and zoom  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_yammer](../includes/pn-yammer.md)]  
  
- Reports 

- Service Calendar 
  
- Customization/Editors  
  
- System Settings  
  
- Advanced Find  
  
- Process dialogs  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_skype_for_business](../includes/pn-skype-for-business.md)] presence  
  
- Entities that use classic forms such as Goal and Order Product see, [Entities using classic forms](../customize/create-design-forms.md).
