# What's supported

You can access customer engagement apps (such as Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, and Dynamics 365 Marketing), built on Microsoft Dataverse and Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) on your mobile device. To do this, install the Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets mobile app on your iOS, [!INCLUDE[tn_android](../includes/tn-android.md)], and Windows 10 devices. You can also use your tablet’s web browser to run customer engagement apps as long as your device has sufficiently high screen resolution.

## Supported tablets to run customer engagement apps in your web browser 

For full functionality and optimized experience, we strongly recommend that you use the Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets mobile app. If you don't have the Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets app installed, you can still use the web browser on your tablet to run your apps. 

> [!NOTE]
> Using the web browser on your phone to run your customer engagement apps is not supported; you must use the Dynamics 365 for phones app. 


## Supported tablets to use the web browser

Customer engagement apps running on a web browser on an iOS or Android tablet provides a similar experience to using it with a web browser on your desktop or laptop computer. However, some features are not available on the mobile app or mobile web browser, including:
  
- Pinch and zoom  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_yammer](../includes/pn-yammer.md)]  
  
- Reports 

- Service Calendar 
  
- Customization/Editors  
  
- System Settings  
  
- Advanced Find  
  
- Process dialogs  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_skype_for_business](../includes/pn-skype-for-business.md)] presence  
  
- Entities that use classic forms such as Goal and Order Product see, [Entities using classic forms](../customize/create-design-forms.md).

If a language is not supported, the user experience will be shown in English.
