# Get session ID and logs to help troubleshoot your issue

If you encounter a problem with the mobile app, you can help Microsoft troubleshoot the problem much more effectively if you provide them with a session ID and logs for that problem.

## Get the session ID from the Setting menu

1. From the navigation bar, select ![Sitemap toggle button.](media/sitemap-button.png "Sitemap toggle button") and then the gear icon (**Settings**).

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Sitemap expanded screenshot, gear icon is at the bottom left.](media/sessionid-uci-step-1.png)

2. Select **Session details** (at the bottom of the menu) and then you'll see the **Session ID**.

### Get the session ID from the sign in screen

On the sign in screen, select the clipboard icon and then select **Copy session ID**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Login screen screenshot, the clipboard menu is expected, copy session id is the second item.](media/sessionid-login-step.jpg)


## Share logs

Send logs directly to Microsoft, so we can help troubleshoot your issue.

1. On the sign in screen, select the clipboard icon and then select **Share logs**.
2. Select a sharing option such as Outlook and then attach the logs to a support ticket. See [Customer Support Plans](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/support/) for details.

Alternatively, you can also share logs from the home screen.

1. Select the site map ![Site map.](media/d365_mobile_sitemap_icon.png "Site map"), and then select your picture or the profile button.
2. Under **Help** select, **Share logs** and then attach the logs to a support ticket. See [Customer Support Plans](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/support/) for details.
