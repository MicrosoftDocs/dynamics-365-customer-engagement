# Overview of securing and managing Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

You can secure and manage [!INCLUDE[pn_Mobile_Express_long](../includes/pn-mobile-express-long.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_moca_full](../includes/pn-moca-full.md)] with the following technologies:  
  
1. **[!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_intune](../includes/pn-microsoft-intune.md)]**. You can use [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_intune](../includes/pn-microsoft-intune.md)] to manage [!INCLUDE[pn_Mobile_Express_short](../includes/pn-mobile-express-short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_moca_short](../includes/pn-moca-short.md)] on [!INCLUDE[tn_apple](../includes/tn-apple.md)] and [!INCLUDE[tn_android](../includes/tn-android.md)] tablets and phones. [!INCLUDE[pn_intune](../includes/pn-intune.md)] provides mobile device management, mobile application management, and PC management capabilities from the cloud. Using [!INCLUDE[pn_intune](../includes/pn-intune.md)], you can provide your users with access to corporate applications, data, and resources from virtually anywhere on almost any device, while helping to keep corporate information secure.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >  This feature was introduced in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_2016_update_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-2016-update-shortest.md)].  
  
2. **[!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_dynamics_crm_for_good](../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-for-good.md)]**. [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_dynamics_crm_for_good](../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-for-good.md)], integrated with [!INCLUDE[pn_good_dynamics](../includes/pn-good-dynamics.md)], protects your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] data even if your users lose or leave their mobile devices somewhere. For example, if someone leaves their device in a taxi cab and can’t get it back right away, [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] data is protected by [!INCLUDE[pn_good_shortest](../includes/pn-good-shortest.md)] encryption. If someone loses their device entirely, all they have to do is notify you so you can remotely wipe [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_dynamics_crm_for_good](../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-for-good.md)] data from their device.

## Manage Dynamics 365 on mobile devices with [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_intune](../includes/pn-microsoft-intune.md)]  
 If your organization is set up with [!INCLUDE[pn_intune](../includes/pn-intune.md)], you can use it to manage the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] for phones and tablets apps on Apple, Android, and Windows 10 tablets and phones. [!INCLUDE[pn_intune](../includes/pn-intune.md)] manages encryption at the device level, as well as app-to-app communications. With [!INCLUDE[pn_intune](../includes/pn-intune.md)], you can selectively wipe managed apps and related data on devices that are unenrolled, no longer compliant, lost, stolen, or retired from use.  
  
 With [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_8_1_0_online_subsequent](../includes/pn-crm-8-1-0-online-subsequent.md)], you can use [!INCLUDE[pn_intune](../includes/pn-intune.md)] mobile application management (MAM) to manage [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] mobile applications for [!INCLUDE[tn_apple](../includes/tn-apple.md)] and [!INCLUDE[tn_android](../includes/tn-android.md)] without enrolling the device. This protects company data in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] without requiring you to enroll and deeply manage the end user's entire device. This is particularly useful for bring-your-own-device (BYOD) scenarios where end users don’t want to or can’t enroll their devices for IT management. This capability is also useful if a device is already enrolled in another mobile application management solution.
