# Enable mobile offline synchronization

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

Enable mobile offline synchronization so users can stay productive wherever they are.
  
1.  In the web app, go to **Settings > Mobile Offline**. If you don’t see this option, your organization might not meet the requirements for enabling mobile offline synchronization.  
  
2.  Click **Mobile Offline Configuration**.  
  
3.  Click **Continue** to accept the terms of the disclaimer and allow data to be shared with an external system on [!INCLUDE[pn-azure-shortest](../../../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] services.  
  
4.  Select **Enable** and click **Save**. This starts the provisioning process for mobile offline. When it completes, your mobile users will automatically experience the new mobile offline capabilities. Users can opt out by choosing **Settings > Disable Sync** in their mobile app.  
  
> [!WARNING]
>  If your user count falls below 1 Enterprise or 5 Professional licenses, mobile offline synchronization will be disabled for your organization.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  **Recommendation for changing data centers or geo locations**  
>   
>  If you decide to move your org to a different data center or geo location, you need to disable and then enable mobile offline synchronization for your org after the move is complete:  
>   
> 1.  Go to **Settings > Mobile Offline.**  
> 2.  Click **Mobile Offline Configuration**.  
> 3.  Click **Continue**.  
> 4.  Select **Disable**, click **Save**, and then click **OK**. This starts the de-provisioning process. If this option isn’t available, mobile offline synchronization was disabled during the move to a different data center or geo location, and you can continue to the next step. When the de-provisioning is complete, select **Enable**, and then click **Save**.
