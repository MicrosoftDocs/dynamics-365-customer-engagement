# Troubleshoot error code 800c0019 on Windows Phones

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../../../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

If you get error code 800c0019 when you try to sign in to your [!INCLUDE[cc_Microsoft](../../../../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] account while using the [!INCLUDE[pn_Mobile_Express_long](../../../../includes/pn-mobile-express-long.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_phones_express](../../../../includes/pn-crm-for-phones-express.md)] apps, chances are that you have the wrong date and time settings on your [!INCLUDE[pn_windows8](../../../../includes/pn-windows8.md)] phone. This can occur after updating your [!INCLUDE[pn_windows8](../../../../includes/pn-windows8.md)] phone, removing and replacing the battery, or after a time change.  
  
 In most cases, your phone’s date and time is set automatically by your mobile operator. If it’s not, you need to set it manually so you can sign in to your [!INCLUDE[cc_Microsoft](../../../../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] account successfully. Here’s how:  
  
1.  On **Start**, flick left to the **App** list and tap **Settings**.  
  
2.  Tap **Date+time**.  
  
3.  Turn off **Set automatically**.  
  
4.  Set the correct values for **Time zone**, **Date**, and **Time**.
