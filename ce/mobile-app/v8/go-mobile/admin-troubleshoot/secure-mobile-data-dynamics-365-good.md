# Secure your mobile data with Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Good

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../../../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

[!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_dynamics_crm_for_good](../../../../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-for-good.md)], integrated with [!INCLUDE[pn_good_dynamics](../../../../includes/pn-good-dynamics.md)], protects your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] data even if you lose or leave your mobile device somewhere. For example, if you leave your device in a taxi cab and can’t get it back right away, your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] data is protected by [!INCLUDE[pn_good_shortest](../../../../includes/pn-good-shortest.md)] encryption. If you lose your device entirely, just notify your admin, who can remotely wipe your [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_dynamics_crm_for_good](../../../../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-for-good.md)] data from your device.  
  
 This app is intended for use only with [!INCLUDE[pn_good_dynamics](../../../../includes/pn-good-dynamics.md)] server software and services from [!INCLUDE[pn_good_technology](../../../../includes/pn-good-technology.md)]. If you’re not using [!INCLUDE[pn_good_dynamics](../../../../includes/pn-good-dynamics.md)], download [!INCLUDE[pn_Mobile_Express_long](../../../../includes/pn-mobile-express-long.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_moca_full](../../../../includes/pn-moca-full.md)] instead from the [Apple App store](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=313645).  
  
## Download the Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Good app  
 You can download the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_dynamics_crm_for_good](../../../../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-for-good.md)] app from the [Apple App store](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=524762). You can also find the app on the [Good Dynamics Marketplace](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=524809).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_dynamics_crm_for_good](../../../../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-for-good.md)] requires iOS 7.0 or later. To use the app on an [!INCLUDE[tn_ipad](../../../../includes/tn-ipad.md)], you need [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_2015](../../../../includes/pn-crm-2015.md)] or later. To use the app on an [!INCLUDE[tn_iphone](../../../../includes/tn-iphone.md)], you need [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_2015_update_1](../../../../includes/pn-crm-online-2015-update-1.md)] or later or [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_2016](../../../../includes/pn-crm-2016.md)].

Instead, the sign-in screen might ask for your Auth Delegate or password for other [!INCLUDE[pn_good_shortest](../../../../includes/pn-good-shortest.md)] apps you might have installed for easy activation.  
  
3.  When prompted, select a [!INCLUDE[pn_good_shortest](../../../../includes/pn-good-shortest.md)] security password.

6.  When prompted, type in your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] credentials.

 If you get an alert when you try to use email or other apps through [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_dynamics_crm_for_good](../../../../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-for-good.md)], your admin may be controlling communication to these apps for security purposes. Contact your [!INCLUDE[pn_good_shortest](../../../../includes/pn-good-shortest.md)] admin to find out which apps your company uses in conjunction with [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_dynamics_crm_for_good](../../../../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-for-good.md)], along with any settings that need to be configured.
