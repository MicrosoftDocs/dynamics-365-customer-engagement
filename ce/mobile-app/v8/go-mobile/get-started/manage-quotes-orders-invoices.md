# Manage quotes, orders, and invoices in Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets

As a sales professional, you'll frequently work with the following types of records:  
  
- **Quotes**: Most sales begin with a price quote, which eventually leads to an order.  
  
- **Orders**:  When a quote is accepted and approved, it becomes an order.  
  
- **Invoices**:  Once an order is shipped or delivered, an invoice is created.  
  
  With [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)], it's easy to customize for the way your organization does business, so  you might see different types of records in your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] system.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Managing quotes, orders, and invoices is not supported in an offline environment.  
> 
>  This feature was introduced in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_8_1_0_op](../../../../includes/pn-crm-8-1-0-op.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_8_1_0_online](../../../../includes/pn-crm-8-1-0-online.md)].
