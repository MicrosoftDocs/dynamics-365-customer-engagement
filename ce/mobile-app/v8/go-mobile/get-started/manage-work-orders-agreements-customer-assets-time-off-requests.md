# Manage work orders, agreements, customer assets, and time off requests in Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets

Field agents can use the mobile app to review work orders and get all the information they need to complete a job. Create a work order, agreement, customer asset, or submit a time off request the same way you create any record in the mobile app.  For more information on field service, see the [Dynamics 365 apps for Field Service - User's Guide](../../../../field-service/user-guide.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  To use these features on the mobile app, you'll need the Microsoft Dynamics 365 apps for Field Service solution. Note also that Field Service is currently supported in online mode only.  
  
## Work orders  
 Work orders have information on what work needs to be done at a customer site. They're used to coordinate and schedule resources and activities, and can be used for installations, repairs, or preventative maintenance.  
  
 To find and open a work order:  
  
1.  Tap the menu icon, and then tap **Work Orders**.  
  
2.  From the list of work orders, tap a work order number to open it.  
  
3.  When the work order opens, you can add notes, attachments, photos, and more.  
  
## Agreements  
 Agreements is where you can see customer contracts. Agreements provide the framework for automatically-generated work orders and invoices, and are ideal for preventative maintenance work.  
  
 An agreement lets you choose how often work orders are generated (daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly), and provide work order details like incidents, products, services, and service tasks.  
  
 To find and open an agreement:  
  
1.  Tap the menu icon, and then tap **Agreements**.  
  
2.  From the list of agreements, tap an agreement number to open it.  
  
## Customer assets  
 Customer assets shows which products a customer uses. This is where you maintain a list of serviceable items that are related to a service location.  
  
 To find and open a customer asset:  
  
1.  Tap the menu icon, and then tap **Customer Assets**.  
  
2.  From the list of customer assets, tap an asset number to open it.  
  
## Time off requests  
 If a field tech is taking some time off, log the request so that dispatchers can see the time off request on the schedule board when they're scheduling work orders.  
  
 To submit a time off request:  
  
1.  Tap the menu icon, and then tap **Time Off Requests.**  
  
2.  Tap the ellipses  , and then tap **New**.  
  
3.  Enter the required information, and  then tap **Save**.
