# Manage accounts, contacts, leads, and opportunities in Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../../../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

## Types of records  
 As a sales professional, you’ll be working a lot with the following types of records:  
  
-   **Accounts** Account records contain information about the companies you do business with.  
  
-   **Contacts** Contact records contain information about the people you know and work with. Usually, multiple contacts are associated with one account. Contacts could include people responsible for making purchasing decisions, people in charge of paying invoices, support technicians, or anyone you work with at the company.  
  
-   **Leads** Leads are potential sales, and you or your company can get leads from many different sources. For example, you can generate sales leads from marketing campaigns, inquiries from your website, mailing lists, social media posts, or in person at a trade convention.  
  
-   **Opportunities** When you qualify a lead, it becomes an opportunity, or a deal that you’re getting ready to close.  
  
## Create or edit stakeholders or sales team members  
  
1.  In **Stakeholders** or **Sales Team** for a lead or opportunity, tap the **New Item** button **+**.  
  
2.  Enter a contact name to look up in the drop-down menu that appears.  
  
3.  Select from the contacts that appear, or, if it’s a new contact, tap the **Add** button and complete the information in the form.  
  
4.  Select a role for the contact.
