As a Customer Service Manager or Customer Service Rep, use the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] for phones and tablets app to keep track of activities in your customer service organization while on the go.

 If your organization has updated to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_8_1_0_online](../../../../includes/pn-crm-8-1-0-online.md)], you can also search the knowledge database or create new knowledge articles.

## Open a case in the web app to work on it in more detail  
 If you need to perform more actions on a case than you can in the mobile app, you can easily open the case in your browser.  

1.  On the case screen, open the command bar.  

2.  Tap **Open in browser**.  

3.  Sign in to the web application when it appears. The web app goes right to the case you had open in the mobile app.
