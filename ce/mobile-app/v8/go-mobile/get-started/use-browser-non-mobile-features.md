# Use your browser for non-mobile features in Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../../../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

## Use your browser for features not in the app  
 The following features in the web application aren’t available in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] for phones and tablets:  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_yammer](../../../../includes/pn-yammer.md)] and activity feeds  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_bing_maps](../../../../includes/pn-bing-maps.md)] integration  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_parature_from_microsoft](../../../../includes/pn-parature-from-microsoft.md)] knowledge base integration  
  
  If you need to use these features or want to view a record in the web application, you can do that in your tablet’s browser. (You can only do this in the tablet app.)  
  
1.  Press and hold the record or view you want to see.  
  
2.  Tap **Open in browser**.  
  
3.  Sign in to the web application when it appears. The web app goes right to the record that you were working on in the mobile app.
