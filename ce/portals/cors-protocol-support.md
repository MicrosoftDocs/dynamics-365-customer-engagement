# CORS protocol support

The [cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) protocol consists of a set of headers that indicates whether a response can be shared with another domain.
The following site settings are used to configure CORS:

|                 Name                  |                                                                            Description                                                                            |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HTTP/Access-Control-Allow-Credentials | The only valid value for this header is true (case-sensitive). If you don't need credentials, omit this header entirely (rather than setting its value to false). |
|   HTTP/Access-Control-Allow-Headers   |                                                   A comma-delimited list of the supported HTTP request headers.                                                   |
|   HTTP/Access-Control-Allow-Methods   |                                      A comma-delimited list of the allowed HTTP request methods such as GET, POST, OPTIONS.                                       |
|   HTTP/Access-Control-Allow-Origin    |                   To allow any resource to access your resources, you can specify \*. Otherwise, specify the URI that can access the resources.                   |
|  HTTP/Access-Control-Expose-Headers   |                A comma-delimited list of HTTP header names other than the simple response headers that the resource might use and can be exposed.                 |
|      HTTP/Access-Control-Max-Age      |                                                       Maximum number of seconds the results can be cached.                                                        |
|                                       |                                                                                                                                                                   |
