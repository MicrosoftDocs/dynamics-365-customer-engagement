## Change the Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement instance, audience, or type of portal

After your portal is created and provisioned, you can change the details of your [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] instance and portal.

1. Go to the [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-online-admin-center](../includes/pn-crm-online-admin-center.md)] page, and then select the **Applications** tab.

2. Select the name of the portal you want to edit, and then select **Manage**.

3. Select the **Manage Dynamics 365 Instance** tab. [!INCLUDE[proc-on-this-page](../includes/proc-on-this-page.md)], you can review the [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] instance that is currently linked to your portal.

4. Select **Update Dynamics 365 Instance**. In the dialog box, use the provided fields to change your [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] instance, portal development status, portal language, or your portal administrator. You can also keep the same [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] instance, but change the portal audience or type of portal.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also select a Dynamics 365 instance that uses Common Data Service to provision a Common Data Service starter portal. More information: [Common Data Service starter portal](cds-portal.md)

5. Select the ![Confirm action](media/confirm-action-icon.png "Confirm action") button to confirm your changes.
