## Change the Dynamics 365 instance, audience, or type of portal

After your portal is created and provisioned, you can change the details of your [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] instance and portal.

1.  Go to the [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)]  Administration center, and then select the **Applications** tab.

2.  Select the name of the portal you want to edit, and then select **Manage**.

3.  Select the **Manage [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] Instance** tab. [!INCLUDE[proc-on-this-page](../includes/proc-on-this-page.md)], you can review the [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] instance that is currently linked to your portal.

4.  Select **Update [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] Instance**. In the dialog box, use the provided fields to change your [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] instance, portal language, or your portal administrator. You can also keep the same [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] instance, but change the portal audience or type of portal.

5.  Select the ![Confirm action](media/confirm-action-icon.png "Confirm action") button to confirm your changes.
