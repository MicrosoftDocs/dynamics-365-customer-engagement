# Configure a contact for use on a portal
After filling out the basic information for a contact in [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)], (or having a user fill out the sign-up form in a portal), go to the web authentication tab on the portal contact form to configure a contact by using local authentication. For more information about federated authentication options, see [Set authentication identity for a portal](set-authentication-identity.md). To configure a contact for portals by using local authentication, follow these instructions:  

1.  Enter a **username**.
2.  On the command ribbon, go to **More Commands** &gt; **Change Password**.

Complete the change password workflow, and the necessary fields will be automatically configured. When you have done this, your contact will be configured for your portals.
