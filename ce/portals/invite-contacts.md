# Invite contacts to your portals

Use the [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] portals invitation feature to invite contacts to your portal through automated email(s) created in your [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] system. The people you invite receive an email, fully customizable by you, with a link to your portal and an invitation code. This code can be used to gain special access configured by you. With this feature you have the ability to:

- Send Single or Group Invitations
-   Specify an expiry date if desired
-   Specify a user or portal contact as the inviter if desired
-   Automatically assign the invited contact(s) to an account upon invite redemption
-   Automatically execute a workflow upon invite redemption
-   Automatically assign the invited contact(s) to a Web Role(s) upon redemption

Invitation redemption can be accomplished using any of our many authentication options. For documentation regarding portal authentication, see [Set authentication identity for a portal](set-authentication-identity.md) and choose the model applicable to your portal version and configuration. The user will adopt any settings provided by the administrator upon redemption. An Invite Redemption Activity will be created for the Invite and Contact.

Invitations are sent via the **Send Invitation** workflow. By default, the workflow creates an email with a generic message and sends it to the invited Contact's primary email address. The **Send Invitation** workflow contains an email template that will need to be edited to contain a specific message for your portal and the correct hyperlink to your portal's **Invite Redemption Page**.

To edit the **Send Invitation** workflow email template, locate it and deactivate it. After it is deactivated, edit the email template to send the message you want and provide a link to the **Invite Redemption Page** of your portal.

> [!NOTE]
> The invitation is sent only to the primary email (emailaddress1) of the contact. The invitation will not be sent to the secondary email (emailaddress2) or alternate email (emailaddress3) of the contact record.
> The **Send Invitation** workflow is supported only in web client.

## Create and configure invitations

To create an Invitation record within [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)], select the **Create Invitation** button in the command bar. The button is available when a single Contact is selected in a Contact View and when viewing a Contact record. Selecting the button will open a new invitation form for the Contact. Invitations can also be created via the Invitations View by selecting **+New**. After the Invitation record has been created, the **Run Workflow** button will appear enabling you to send the Invitation to the Contact(s).

## Run the Send Invitation workflow

The invitation will not be sent to the Contact(s) until the **Send Invitation** workflow is initiated.

The Invitation Form has the following fields:


|                 Name                  |                                                                                                                            Description                                                                                                                             |
