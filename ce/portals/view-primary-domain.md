# View the primary domain name in [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)]

When you provision a portal, the domain name is stored in the **Primary Domain Name** field on the website record. If any change is made to the domain name through the Portal Administration Center, the latest domain name is stored in the **Primary Domain Name** field. If you have not created a custom domain name, the vanity domain name is stored in the **Primary Domain Name** field.

If a portal user manually changes the value in the **Primary Domain Name** field, the value is updated only if it is one of the valid domain names.

For example:

The existing domain name is contoso.microsoftcrmportals.com. The initial value of the **Primary Domain Name** field is set to contoso.microsoftcrmportals.com.

You configure a custom domain name as myportal.com. The updated value of the **Primary Domain Name** field is myportal.com.
Letâ€™s take the following scenarios:
- **Scenario 1**: If a portal user changes the **Primary Domain Name** field value to yourportal.com, the value of the field will be reverted to myportal.com, which is the primary domain name.
- **Scenario 2**: If a portal user changes the **Primary Domain Name** field value to contoso.microsoftcrmportals.com, the value of the field will be retained because it is one of the valid domain names.

To view the primary domain name in [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)]:
1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)].
2. Go to **Portals** > **Website** > **Websites**.
3. Select the website for which you want to see the primary domain name.
4. View the name stored in the **Primary Domain Name** field under the **General** section.
