# Change the base URL of a portal

You can change the base URL of a portal after it is provisioned. For example, if you choose `contosocommunity.microsoftcrmportals.com` as the base URL when provisioning the portal, you can later change it to `contosocommunityportal.microsoftcrmportals.com` to meet your requirements.

> [!NOTE]
> Once you change the base URL of your portal, the older URL will no longer be accessible and it will become available for other customers to use for their portals.

1.	Go to the Dynamics 365 Administration Center page and select the **Applications** tab.

2.	Select the name of the portal for which you want to change the base URL, and then select **Manage**.

3.	Go to **Portal Actions** > **Change base URL**.

4.	In the Change base URL window, enter the new base URL for the portal.
