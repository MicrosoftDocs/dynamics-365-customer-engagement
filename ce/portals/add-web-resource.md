# Add the Azure Storage web resource to a form

Attachments uploaded to [!include[Azure](../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] Storage instead of directly to [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] can be managed by using notes in [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)].

To enable attachments from a particular form to be uploaded into [!include[Azure](../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] Storage, you must add a web resource to that form and you must [configure Azure Storage for your organization](enable-azure-storage.md).

> [!Note]
> In this example, the form is added to the Lead form for the Lead entity. We recommend using caution when editing existing forms.

When a file (for example, attachments.zip) is uploaded to [!include[Azure](../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] Storage by using the portal, it is represented by a note on an entity and a placeholder for the attachment.

![Attachment on a form](media/notes-attachment-lead-form.png "Placeholder for the attachment on a form")

Note that the attachment file is now named attachment.zip.txt. By default, [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] has no conception of an [!include[Azure](../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] file, so this placeholder .txt file is stored in [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] instead. The [!include[Azure](../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] Storage context for the placeholder file shows details about the file.
```
{
 "Name": "attachment.zip",
 "Type": "application/x-zip-compressed",
 "Size": 24890882,
 "Url": "https://accountname.blob.core.windows.net/storage/81a9a9491c36e51182760026833bcf82/attachment.zip"
}
```

To see and interact with the file stored in [!include[Azure](../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)], you must add the web resource adx.annotations.html to the form.
1. In the form editor for the relevant form, select **Web Resource** on the **Insert** tab.

2. In the **Web resource** box, select **adx_annotations/adx.annotations.html**.

3. Enter a name and label for the resource.

4. In the **Custom Parameter (data)** box, enter **azureEnabled=true**. <br>You can also use the web resource without enabling [!include[Azure](../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] support in this way, in which case it will function almost entirely the same as the default control.</br>

5. On the **Formatting** tab, choose whatever formatting rules you prefer. We recommend that you clear the **Display border** check box.

6. Select **OK** to save the resource.

7. Optionally, you might want to remove the existing notes control, or move it to a tab or section that is marked to be not visible by default.

8. Save the form, and then publish the changes.

   ![Add web resource](media/add-web-resource.png "Add a web resource")

The new control will now be rendered on the page, giving you the ability to manage your attachments in [!include[Azure](../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] Storage.

![Azure file attachment on a form](media/azure-file-attachment-lead-form.png "Azure file attachment on a form")

The paper-clip icon has been replaced with a cloud icon to denote that this file is stored in [!include[Azure](../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] Storage. You can continue to store attachments in [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)]; those files will be denoted with the paper-clip icon.

> [!Note]
> You must add cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) rule on your [!include[Azure](../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] Storage account as follows, otherwise you will see the regular attachment icon rather than the cloud icon.
> - **Allowed origins**: Specify your Dynamics 365 domain. For example, contoso.crm.dynamics.com.
> - **Allowed verbs**: GET, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, POST
> - **Allowed headers**: Specify the request headers that the origin domain may specify on the CORS request. For example, x-ms-meta-data\*, x-ms-meta-target\*. 
> - **Exposed headers**: Specify the response headers that may be sent in the response to the CORS request and exposed by the browser to the request issuer. For example, x-ms-meta-\*.
> - **Maximum age (seconds)**: Specify the maximum amount time that a browser should cache the preflight OPTIONS request. For example, 200.

If the attached file is an image, the control will display the image as a thumbnail whether it is stored in [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] or [!include[Azure](../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] Storage.

> [!Note]
> The thumbnail feature is limited to images under 1 MB in size.

## CORS protocol support

The [cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) protocol consists of a set of headers that indicates whether a response can be shared with another domain.
The following site settings are used to configure CORS:

|                 Name                  |                                                                            Description                                                                            |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HTTP/Access-Control-Allow-Credentials | The only valid value for this header is true (case-sensitive). If you don't need credentials, omit this header entirely (rather than setting its value to false). |
|   HTTP/Access-Control-Allow-Headers   |                                                   A comma-delimited list of the supported HTTP request headers.                                                   |
|   HTTP/Access-Control-Allow-Methods   |                                      A comma-delimited list of the allowed HTTP request methods such as GET, POST, OPTIONS.                                       |
|   HTTP/Access-Control-Allow-Origin    |                   To allow any resource to access your resources, you can specify \*. Otherwise, specify the URI that can access the resources.                   |
|  HTTP/Access-Control-Expose-Headers   |                A comma-delimited list of HTTP header names other than the simple response headers that the resource might use and can be exposed.                 |
|      HTTP/Access-Control-Max-Age      |                                                       Maximum number of seconds the results can be cached.                                                        |
|                                       |                                                                                                                                                                   |
