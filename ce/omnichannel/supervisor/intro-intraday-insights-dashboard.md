# Introduction to intraday supervisor experiences

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Customers must ensure they comply with all applicable laws relating to monitoring, recording, and storing communications with their end users. This includes adequately notifying end users that their communications with agents may be monitored, recorded, or stored and, as required by applicable laws, obtaining consent from end users before using the feature with them. Customers are also encouraged to have a mechanism in place to inform their agents that their communications with end users may be monitored, recorded, or stored.

Customer service managers or supervisors are responsible for managing the agents who work with customers to resolve queries every day through various service channels.

Omnichannel for Dynamics 365 Customer Service provides dashboards that help supervisors keep track of the work that their agents do. As a supervisor, you can use these dashboards to perform these tasks:

-	Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs)

-	Monitor quality and workload of agent

-	Monitor unassigned workload

-	Manage agent and customer escalations 

As a supervisor, you see the following tabs when you open the Omnichannel for Customer Service app:

- **My dashboard**: This tab provides information about the conversations that you're directly connected and engaged with customers as an agent, such as your ongoing conversations, items that are available for you to pick, and closed conversations. To learn more, see [Introduction to the agent interface](../agent/agent-oc/oc-introduction-agent-interface.md). 

- **Omnichannel intraday insights dashboard**: This tab provides an overview of information about the health and KPIs of agents in your organization. The information in this dashboard is displayed based on the last 24 hours conversations. To learn more, see [Omnichannel intraday insights dashboard](intraday-insights-dashboard.md).

- **Ongoing Conversations dashboard**: This tab provides information about the conversations that agents are handling and are in active, open, wrap up, and waiting states. To learn more, see [Ongoing Conversations dashboard](ongoing-conversations-dashboard.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Contact your system administrator, for configuration errors or if you are unable to view the dashboards. to learn more, see [Configure to view intraday insights dashboard](../administrator/configure-intraday-dashboard-supervisor.md).
