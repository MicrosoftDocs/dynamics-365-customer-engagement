# Manage users in Omnichannel for Customer Service

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

All Dynamics 365 users who are assigned the **Omnichannel administrator**, **Omnichannel supervisor**, or **Omnichannel agent** security role are enabled for Omnichannel and become Omnichannel users.

For more information on how to create users and assign security roles, see [Assign roles and enable users for Omnichannel for Customer Service](add-users-assign-roles.md).

Navigate to **Queues & Users > Users** to view the list of Omnichannel users in the **Omnichannel Users** view.
