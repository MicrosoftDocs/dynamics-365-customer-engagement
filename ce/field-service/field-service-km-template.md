# Create a knowledge article template

Knowledge article templates help knowledge authors simplify the process of creating knowledge articles. Templates also help authors maintain consistency in branding, language, and structure.

When an author chooses a template to create an article, certain fields in the template are prepopulated with values, allowing the author to focus on the main content of the article.

## Create a template

You can create knowledge article templates by defining the necessary fields such as Language, Title, Keywords, and Subject.

1. In Field Service, go to **Settings** > **Knowledge management** > **Knowledge article templates** and select **New**.
1. Choose a language and select **OK**.
1. Enter a name and owner.
1. Under **Article Data**, enter the values for the required fields that you want to prepopulate when the template is selected.
1. Under **Content**, establish a structure to be used for any knowledge article created from this template.
