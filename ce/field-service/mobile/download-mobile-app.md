# Download the mobile app

The Dynamics 365 Field Service mobile app works on iOS and Android devices and on Windows laptops and tablets. It gives technicians the tools they need to serve customers onsite.

Sample screens show both the classic user experience ("Unified Interface UX") and the new mobile app user experience in separate tabs.

## Prerequisites

A system administrator has [set up the mobile app](set-up-field-service-mobile.md), user profiles, and security roles.

## Download the app

Go to the app store on your iOS, Android, or Windows device and search for **Dynamics 365 Field Service**.

- Android app: [Dynamics 365 Field Service on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.crm.crmphone.fieldServices)
- iOS app: [Dynamics 365 Field Service in the Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/field-service-dynamics-365/id1485579247)
- Windows app: [Dynamics 365 Field Service in the Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9PMX4FNSSF5P)

System requirements for the Field Service mobile app are the same as for the Power Apps mobile app. See [Supported platforms for running apps using the Power Apps mobile app](/power-apps/limits-and-config#supported-platforms-for-running-apps-using-the-power-apps-mobile-app).

## Supported mobile devices

The required storage size depends on the [mobile offline profile](work-offline.md). It specifies the amount of data that your organization needs to download for when there's no internet access.
