# Work offline and update offline data

To work in areas without internet access, the app downloads important information to the mobile device for a seamless experience. When the device connects to the internet, data automatically syncs with the server.

An administrator has to configure the offline profile for the app before technicians can download the data. 
Downloading the offline data can take some time. You can check the download progress and status in the app while downloads are in progress.

Administrators [define which data is available offline](set-up-offline-profile.md) and [how often the app looks for changes on the server](offline-data-sync.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The new mobile experience doesn't support working offline.
