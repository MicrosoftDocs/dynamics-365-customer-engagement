# Enable technicians to create service reports

Field Service technicians can create service reports to summarize the work they performed. These reports can contain details such as tasks completed, and products or parts used during the service. Service reports can be delivered to the customer as a PDF file.

Administrators or developers can add a reporting solution as a custom control, add relevant customizations, and enable service report for technicians.

## Install, extend, and enable the reporting solution

For detailed instructions, see [Add a custom reporting control for service reports in Dynamics 365 Field Service](/dynamics365/guidance/resources/fs-reporting-solution-service-reports).
