# Set up work order sub-statuses to map work order status more precisely (Field Service)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Work order records in [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_field_service](../includes/pn-dyn-365-field-service.md)] progress through their lifecycle using system status values of:  
  
-   Open - Unscheduled  
  
-   Open - Scheduled  
  
-   Open - In Progress  
  
-   Open - Completed  
  
-   Closed - Posted  
  
-   Closed - Canceled  
  
Work order system status values can't be modified in the system; however, to allow your company to create custom status values, you can create one or more sub-status values associated with each system status. This lets you map work order statuses to your unique business processes more precisely.  
  
1.  From the main menu, click **Field Service** > **Administration**, and then choose **Work Order Sub-Statuses**.  
  
2.  On the **Active Work Order Sub-Statuses** screen, click **+New** in the upper left corner.  
  
3.  Use the tooltips to help fill in your information, and then click **Save**.
