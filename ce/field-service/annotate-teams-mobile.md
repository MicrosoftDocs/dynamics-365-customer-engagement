Spatial annotations can greatly enhance your communication and collaboration, especially when working with remote teams. Use spatial annotations to:

- **Quickly communicate detailed and complex instructions visually**: Enhance communication by using Remote Assist to engage remote collaborators through annotations.
- **Bring critical information into view**: Remote collaborators can offer precise guidance for different parts, including hard-to-reach parts. Use drawings and arrows to refer to specific parts of a machine or asset.
- **Solve problems in real time**: Technicians can share their real-time view with experts in remote locations to get the help they need, reducing travel time and cost.
- **Knowledge sharing and training**: Use annotations, photos, and videos to capture and share with the rest of your organization.

You can annotate in calls with Microsoft Teams mobile users if you have a Dynamics 365 Guides, Remote Assist, or Field Service licenses. Microsoft Teams desktop users can annotate in a mobile user's space. Use the **Spatial Annotations** toolbar in Teams to add annotations.

1. Use the **Spatial Annotations** toolbar to place arrows or draw in your space for other callers to see or annotate in another user's space.

   |Button|Description|
   |---------|----------------------------------------------------|
   |:::image type="icon" source="../field-service/media/calling-annotations-teams-arrow-button.png":::| Add an arrow. To add an arrow, tap where you want to place the arrow. To control the direction of the arrow, tap, hold, and rotate the arrow until it's facing the desired direction. To change the size of the arrow, tap, hold, and drag to the size you want. Release to lock the arrow in place.|
   |:::image type="icon" source="../field-service/media/calling-annotations-teams-ink-button.png":::|Add ink (draw).|

   |:::image type="icon" source="../field-service/media/calling-annotations-teams-undo-button.png":::|Undo the most recent annotation you added.|
   |:::image type="icon" source="../field-service/media/calling-annotations-teams-erase-all-button.png":::|To delete all annotations that you added, select this button, and then select **Delete Annotations**. This action doesn't clear annotations made by other users.|

   > [!NOTE]
   > Each call participant can only undo and delete their own annotations.

1. When youâ€™re done annotating, close the toolbar. All annotations persist even after you stop editing.
