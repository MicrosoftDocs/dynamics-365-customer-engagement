# Set up purchase order sub-statuses to track purchase order status more precisely (Field Service)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Purchase orders can be created to track items that need to be ordered from your suppliers. A purchase order record has system status values of Draft, Submitted, Canceled, Products Received, and Billed. Optionally, you can create one or more sub-status values for each of the system status values to help track the purchase order status more precisely, according to your business practices.  
  
 For example, for the system status of Submitted, you could create sub-status values of "Waiting for vendor confirmation" and "In route to warehouse."  
  
1.  From the main menu, click **Field Service** > **Administration**, and then choose **Purchase Order Sub-Statuses**.  
  
2.  On the **Active Purchase Order Sub-Statuses** screen, click **New** in the upper left corner.  
  
3.  Use the tooltips to help fill in information, and then click **Save**.
