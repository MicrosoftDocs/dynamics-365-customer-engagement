# Privacy Note for Field Service Mobile Push Notifications

Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates) licenses this supplement to you. You may use it with each validly licensed subscription of Microsoft Dynamics 365 services (the “online service”). You may not use the supplement if you do not have a license for the online service. The license terms for the online service apply to your use of this supplement. Microsoft provides support services for the supplement as described at https://support.microsoft.com/common/international.aspx. This supplement enables authorized users to access the online service by means of the companion Field Service mobile applications for Microsoft Dynamics 365 (the “App”), which users need to install and license separately.

**IMPORTANT:**  By installing this supplement, **(1)** you consent to share addresses with an external system (Bing Maps) to locate addresses on a map and determine distance and travel time between locations, this supplement overrides your command on the admin System Settings to disable Bing Maps, please consult Bing Maps technical documentation for more information; and **(2)** you consent to allow authorized users, accessing the online service, to instruct the App to:

1. Transmit addresses to the third party mapping service provider designated by the Operating System on a mobile device.

2. Transmit your organization’s assigned ID and assigned end user ID, and device ID to Microsoft and Resco.net, Inc. for purposes of providing the services and verifying that the software is properly licensed.

Authorized users may instruct the App to access the online service at the time of installation of the supplement. The functions listed above are enabled by the App only. Disabling these functions must be accomplished by uninstalling the supplement. If you do not agree to these terms, do not install the supplement.

Your use of Bing Maps is governed by the [Bing Maps End User Terms](https://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9710837) and the [Bing Maps Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839). Your use of third party mapping services is governed by their service specific end user terms and privacy statements. You should carefully review these other end user terms and privacy statements.
