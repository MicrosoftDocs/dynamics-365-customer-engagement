# Experiment with demo data (Field Service)

To become familiar with Dynamics 365 Field Service, it’s useful to have a pre-configured environment to explore. For this purpose, we’ve created a separate sample data installation package (English-language only at this time) that makes it easier to learn about these solutions. 

The installation package is available on the [Microsoft Download Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=859966).  

Running the Package Deployer install performs the following actions:
  
-   Creates or sets default parameters that drive behavior of Project Service  
  
-   Imports sample data such as Bookable Resources, Roles, Sales and Cost Price lists, Organizational Units, relevant sales process records, Work Orders and Projects    
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **There is no way to un-install the demo data.** Therefore, you should only use this package on demonstration, evaluation, training and test systems.

For more information, see this [blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/crm/2017/10/24/microsoft-dynamics-365-for-field-service-and-project-service-automation-sample-data).
