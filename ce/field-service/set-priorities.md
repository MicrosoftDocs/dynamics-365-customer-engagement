# Define priorities for work orders

Priority records let you prioritize your work orders. You can also assign each priority value a custom color, which will display in the outline of the resource booking time slot on the schedule board. Priority records enable dispatchers to visually distinguish a job's priority while managing the schedule.  
  
1. In Field Service, change to the **Settings** area.

1. In the **Work Orders** section, select **Priorities**.  
  
1. Select **New** to create a new priority record.
  
1. Provide a **Name**, choose a **Level of Importance**, and a **Priority Color**.

1. Select **Save**.
