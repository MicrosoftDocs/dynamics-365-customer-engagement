# Define priorities for work orders

Use priority records to prioritize your work orders. You can assign a custom color to each priority value. This color is used for the outline of the resource booking's time slot on the schedule board. Priority records help dispatchers distinguish a job's priority while they manage the schedule.

1. In Dynamics 365 Field Service, select the **Settings** area.
1. Under **Work orders**, select **Priorities**.
1. Select **New**.
1. Enter the following information:

    - **Name**: Enter a name for the priority.
    - **Level of Importance**: Choose a number from *1* through *10* to define the level of importance of the priority. For example, for an urgent priority, you might set the level of importance to *10*.
    - **Priority Value**: Specify a number from *1* through *100*. This value is used by the [Scheduling Operations Agent](./soa-overview.md) for scheduling optimization operations.
    - **Priority Color**: Specify a color for the priority.

1. Select **Save**.
