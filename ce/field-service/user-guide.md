## Set up Field Service
The purpose of this section is to help you set up a Field Service environment and configure the core Field Service scenario.

### Set up an environment
This includes deploying an environment, setting up users, and performing initial administrative actions.

- [Perform initial configurations](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/field-service/perform-initial-configurations-setup)

### Configure work order scenario
This includes creating a work order, scheduling it to a resource, and viewing it on the Field Service Mobile app.

- [Quickstart - Create and schedule a work order](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/field-service/quickstart-schedule-work-order)

Additionally, configuring the core Field Service scenario involves understanding resources, work orders, scheduling, and the mobile app.

#### Mobility
- [Installation](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/field-service/install-field-service#download-the-field-service-mobile-app-on-a-phone-or-tablet)

- [Overview of features and requirements](field-service-mobile-overview.md)

- [Configure and customize](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/field-service/mobile-app-configuration-customization)

- [Get started with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Field Service Mobile](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/implement-get-started-with-microsoft-dynamics-365-for-field-service-mobile/)

- [Deliver a customized mobile experience in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Field Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/implement-deliver-a-customized-mobile-experience/)

## Configure more scenarios
The purpose of this section is to help you explore all the features of Field Service and configure more detailed scenarios and business requirements.

Start with this [Learn course](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/implementing-dyn365-field-service/) that shows an administrative view of the previous work order scenario to create products, services, incidents, and other core work order entities.

### Scheduling
Next, dive into configuring the schedule board and exploring other scheduling capabilities such as crews, facilities, and pools with this [Learn course](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/universal-resource-scheduling/).

### Agreements, assets, and inventory

After that, look into using [agreements](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/field-service/set-up-customer-agreements) to auto-generate recurring work orders, [customer assets](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/field-service/configure-set-up-customer-assets) to build service history, and [inventory](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/field-service/create-warehouse) to track parts usage from a field technicians truck.


### Resource Scheduling Optimization
The pinnacle of field service scheduling is Resource Scheduling Optimization (RSO), which automatically schedules work orders (and other requirements) to the best resources in order to minimize total travel time and maximize working hours.

- ![Video symbol](../field-service/media/video-icon.png "Video symbol") [What is RSO?](https://youtu.be/3W7hI-6dZhg)
- ![Video symbol](../field-service/media/video-icon.png "Video symbol") [Quickstart: Auto schedule a list of work orders](https://youtu.be/oJ-3HTJWRMo)

Learn how to [deploy, configure, and run RSO](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/field-service/rso-overview).


### Connected Field Service

Similarly, the pinnacle of work order creation is Connected Field Service (CFS) that combines AzureIoT and Dynamics 365 to analyze data streams from Internet-connected equipment and proactively create work orders based on alerts - often before the customer is aware of a problem.

First, get an [Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/field-service/connected-field-service) of CFS and learn about the [CFS with IoTHub architecture](../field-service/developer/connected-field-service-architecture.md) to better understand how Azure and Dynamics 365 work together.

Next, learn the difference between CFS with [IoTCentral](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/field-service/cfs-iot-overview) and CFS with [IoTHub](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/field-service/developer/connected-field-service-developer-guide). In short, think of **IoTCentral** as the software-as-a-service option, an easy way to create and demonstrate a prototype, perform a proof-of-concept, test the IoT process with dynamics to outline structure and objectives, and implement CFS for organizations starting from scratch with no IoT infrastructure. Think of **IoTHub** as the platform offering and what will most likely be implemented because it is more customizable and is especially helpful for organizations with existing IoT infrastructure.

Next, set up a Connected Field Service environment to create work orders from simulated IoT data. See the following video tutorial for detailed instructions: ![Video symbol](../field-service/media/video-icon.png "Video symbol") [Set up Connected Field Service with Azure IoTCentral](https://youtu.be/Sp7_JoXjHDk)

Finally, here is a [Learn course](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/working-with-connected-field-service-iot/) to guide you through setting up CFS with IoTCentral.

> [!Note]
> Combining Resource Scheduling Optimization and Connected Field Service allows an organization to proactively detect issues and schedule them to field technicians to fix.

## Implement Field Service

The purpose of this section is to provide implementation guidance and best practices, both technical and strategic. It also points toward extensibility and developer instructions.

When working through implementation scenarios, it is important to know org level details that can be found in [Field Service Settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/field-service/configure-default-settings).

- ![Video symbol](../field-service/media/video-icon.png "Video symbol") [General Field Service implementation best practices](https://youtu.be/LQXpjMMrJIo)

### Scheduling best practices
- [Types of Scheduling](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/field-service/scheduling-capabilities)

- [Scheduling personas](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/field-service/scheduling-roles-personas)

- [The five stages of scheduling adoption](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/field-service/5-stages-scheduling-adoption)

- [Schedule board tab settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/field-service/schedule-board-tab-settings) are important in implementations to get the most out of the schedule board.

- [Scheduling extensibility](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/common-scheduler/developer/extensibility-release-notes)

### Key implementation resources
- Stay up to date on new and upcoming features with the [Dynamics 365 release notes](https://docs.microsoft.com/business-applications-release-notes/).

- Use the [version history](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/field-service/version-history) to know the latest version and download the latest mobile projects.

- Understand [AppSource add-ins](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/field-service/appsource-addins) to meet more implementation requirements.
