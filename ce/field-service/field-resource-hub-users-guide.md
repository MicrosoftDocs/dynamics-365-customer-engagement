# User Guide (Field Resource Hub)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

With the Field Resource Hub app field techs can do basic tasks in the field like viewing upcoming appointments, viewing and editing bookings, completing service tasks including adding products, notes, and signatures. Field techs can also submit time-off requests so a dispatcher knows when the tech isn’t available.  

**Available anywhere, on any device**

There are two flavors of [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_field_service](../includes/pn-dyn-365-field-service.md)]: 

- If you’re using a desktop browser, you’ll use the Field Service app. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](.../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [User Guide (Field Service)](../field-service/user-guide.md).

- If you’re a field tech using a smartphone or tablet, you’ll use the Field Resource Hub app which is a subset of the Field Service app. The Field Resource Hub app is built on the Unified Interface framework, which uses responsive web design principles to provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience for any screen size, device, or orientation.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're looking for the full-featured Field Service mobile app, it’s a different mobile app called Field Service Mobile. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](.../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Field Service Mobile App User Guide](../field-service/field-service-mobile-app-user-guide.md).
