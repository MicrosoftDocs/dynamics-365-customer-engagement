# Dynamics 365 Field Service Plugin for Microsoft Copilot

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Dynamics 365 Field Service Plugin for Microsoft Copilot is no longer available after January 15 for users of the Field Service app in Microsoft Teams. For more information, see [Feature deprecations](deprecations-field-service.md).

With the Dynamics 365 Field Service Plugin for Microsoft Copilot, Dynamics 365 Field Service frontline managers and workers can access key work order information by asking Microsoft Copilot questions within Microsoft Teams. Users with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license can simply state in chat what they need using natural language to receive specific information related to their work orders in Field Service. This feature adheres to [responsible AI guidelines](faqs-m365-chat.md).

Copilot can also search through a work order's attachments to provide answers to questions. Attachments can be knowledge articles, manuals, or any documentation that can assist the technician in completing the work order. Frontline managers must first upload the information relevant to the work order so that Copilot can access the information. Go to [Add attachments to a work order](flw-teams-manager.md#add-attachments-to-a-work-order).

After a frontline manager uploads any relevant information to the work order, frontline workers can quickly get answers such as required tools or step-by-step instructions from Copilot.

To access this chat feature, an admin must [set up Microsoft Copilot for Field Service work orders](flw-copilot-setup.md).

## Best practices

- Ask any straightforward question about Field Service work orders. Ambiguous questions such as "What are the most important work orders" might not return results because "most important" isn't a defined status. Instead, ask "What are the high-priority work orders?"

- Be specific about the expected outcomes. For example, if you want results in table format, then use the phrase "in table format." If you want a consolidated result or summary, be specific. For example, "What is the incident type and service account for work order 00041?"

## Frontline managers and dispatchers
