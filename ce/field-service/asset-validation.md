# Disable customer asset validation on work orders

Usually, work orders can include only [customer assets](assets.md) that are related to the service account. However, you can disable customer asset validation and allow work orders to include assets that are related to other accounts. For example, in a rent or lease scenario, a service provider might own an asset, but work orders refer to the customer who uses that asset.

1. In Dynamics 365 Field Service, select the **Settings** area.
1. Under **General**, select **Field Service Settings**.
1. On the **Work Order / Booking** tab, turn on the following settings:

    - **Disable Customer Asset Validation**: Allow work orders to search all assets, not just assets that are related to the service account.
    - **Suggest Reparenting Customer Assets**: Allow work order owners to change the service account of the work order so that it matches the account of the customer asset.

1. Select **Save**.
