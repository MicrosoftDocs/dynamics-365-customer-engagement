# Knowledge management overview

When technicians in the field work on assigned jobs, they need access to relevant information to do their work or solve problems they encounter.

Knowledge management in Dynamics 365 Field Service links relevant knowledge articles to work orders, incidents, products, and customer assets. Examples of knowledge articles include instructions, troubleshooting guides, maintenance procedures, and helpful tips.

Access to knowledge articles helps improve the fix rate by providing technicians with guidance on procedures, troubleshooting, and solutions. This guidance increases their productivity.

## Features of knowledge management

Administrators and dispatchers can create and manage knowledge articles and track their statistics.

- [Create formatted knowledge articles](field-service-knowledge-management.md#create-a-knowledge-article) in the Designer text editor and include text, pictures, and videos.
- Create knowledge articles from a [template](field-service-km-template.md) that includes prepopulated fields.
- [Review knowledge articles](field-service-knowledge-management.md#review-a-knowledge-article) for accuracy before publishing.
- [Publish articles](field-service-knowledge-management.md#publish-a-knowledge-article) once they're approved or at a later date. Technicians can't access knowledge articles until they're published.
- [Manage article versions](field-service-km-versions.md) to keep your articles up to date.
- [Create translations](field-service-km-translate.md).
- [Track and analyze](field-service-km-analyze.md) knowledge article statistics.

Dispatchers and technicians can [search](field-service-km-search.md) and [link](field-service-km-link.md) knowledge articles to work orders, incidents, products, and customer assets. They can [rate and provide feedback](field-service-km-ratings-feedback.md) about the knowledge articles.
