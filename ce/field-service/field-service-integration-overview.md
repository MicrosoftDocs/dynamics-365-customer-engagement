# Overview of Field Service integrations

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Field Service integrates with various business apps to streamline your field service data and operations. 


## Integrate with Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management

While Dynamics 365 Field Service includes basic inventory capabilities for managing frontline worker truck stock, tracking asset service history, requesting purchase orders, and documenting returns; many field service organizations still integrate Field Service with their enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Organizations using the Microsoft Dynamics 365 stack will find it easy to integrate Dynamics 365 Field Service and Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management systems. By leveraging Microsoft Dataverse (formerly Common Data Service), you can set up a synchronous two-way integration. For more information, see the article: [Integrate Dynamics 365 Field Service and Supply Chain Management](supply-chain-field-service-integration.md).

## Integrate with Dynamics 365 Remote Assist

If your organization is using Dynamics 365 Remote Assist, frontline workers can trigger a mixed reality video call from the Field Service mobile app or their HoloLens. This connects the frontline worker with a remote collaborator who can share their expertise and ultimately increase the chances of fixing the issue on the first trip. For more information, see the article: [collaborate in mixed reality with Field Service, Dynamics 365 Remote Assist](remote-assist-hololens.md).

## Integrate with Dynamics 365 Guides

Integration with Dynamics 365 Guides lets Field Service customers attach mixed reality guides to Field Service tasks, allowing frontline workers to launch the Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app to view the assigned guide and get their work done. For more information, see the article: [Integrate Field Service with Dynamics 365 Guides](mixed-reality-guides-integration.md).

## Integrate with Microsoft Teams

Integrate with Microsoft Teams to chat with team members in the context of work orders. Teams integration makes it easy to find answers and fix issues the first time. It also makes it easy to understand which team members may have previously worked on a work order.

After enabling the integration (currently in public preview), open a Teams panel from the work order form in Dynamics 365 and initiate chats with other team members. For more information, see the articles: [Collaborate on work orders with Microsoft Teams](field-service-teams-collaboration.md) and [Microsoft Teams integration with customer engagement apps in Dynamics 365](/dynamics365/teams-integration/teams-integration).

## Integrate with SAP

Integrate Dynamics 365 Field Service with SAP C-4Hana and SAP S-4Hana to connect your work order scheduling system to your enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. Microsoft offers guidance for integrating Field Service with the SAP Planned Maintenance and SAP Industry-Specific Utility (IS-U) modules. Integration is done by connecting SAP to the Dataverse (formerly Common Data Service), which Field Service is built on, along with other Dynamics 365 modules. For more information, see the article: [Integrate Dynamics 365 Field Service and Supply Chain Management](field-service-sap-integration.md).
