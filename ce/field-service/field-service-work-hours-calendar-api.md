# Edit work hour calendars by using APIs 

Organizations often need to programmatically create, edit, or delete work hours on the calendars of their resources. Calendars show working hours, time off, and breaks that determine the availability of a resource when work is being scheduled. Those resources must be scheduled in specific time zones, might or might not observe business closures, and can have variable capacity. For information about defining work hours in the Field Service app, go to [Add work hours to a bookable resource](/dynamics365/field-service/set-up-bookable-resources#add-work-hours).

In addition to using the Field Service app, you can use the following APIs to modify calendar rules for selected record types:

- The Save Calendar API (`msdyn_SaveCalendar`) creates or updates calendar records on a selected entity, based on the inputs passed as the request.
- The Delete Calendar API (`msdyn_DeleteCalendar`) deletes all [inner calendar rules](/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/developer/calendar-entities) of a calendar on a selected entity, based on the inputs passed as the request.

This topic contains details about each API's input (request) and output (response), and their usage, with examples.

## Prerequisites

- Platform version 9.2.21055 or above with Universal Resource Scheduling version 3.12.45.7.
- Usage of one of the following record types: 
  - [Bookable resource](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/web-api/bookableresource?view=dynamics-ce-odata-9&preserve-view=true)
  - [Resource requirement](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/web-api/msdyn_resourcerequirement?view=dynamics-ce-odata-9&preserve-view=true)
  - [Work hour template](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/web-api/msdyn_workhourtemplate?view=dynamics-ce-odata-9&preserve-view=true)
  - [Project](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/web-api/msdyn_project?view=dynamics-ce-odata-9&preserve-view=true)

## Calendar event types

When you create a calendar, you define how many times a [work hour type](#work-hour-types) will occur&mdash;once, all day, every week, or every day, or you can create a custom recurrence. For more information about these calendar events, go to the [examples later in this topic](#example-scenarios-for-api-usage).

### Occurrence

When a work hour type occurs only once in the entity's calendar, it's called an *occurrence*.

For example, consider a resource working from 5:00 AM to 10:00 AM on May 26, 2021. These APIs only support this type of occurrence, which starts and ends within the same day. For another example, consider a resource working from May 26, 2021 at 8:00 PM 10:00 AM on May 27, 2021. You can't create this occurrence by using just one call of the `msdyn_SaveCalendar` API; you need to make two calls instead. 

### All-day occurrence

When a work hour type occurs for one or more whole days, starting at midnight (12:00 AM) of the start date, it's an *all-day occurrence*. The maximum duration for an all-day occurrence is five years.

For example, a resource works all day from May 26, 2021 to the end of the day on May 30, 2021. This is an all-day occurrence that lasts five days.

### Weekly recurrence

When a work hour type occurs at the same time on selected days of every week, it's called a *weekly recurrence*.

For example, a resource works from 5:00 AM to 10:00 AM every Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

### Daily recurrence

When a work hour type occurs at the same time every day, it's called a *daily recurrence*.

For example, a resource works from 5:00 AM to 10:00 AM every day of the week.

### Custom recurrence

When a work hour type occurs at certain times on certain days of the week, but the times are different on different days, you can create a *custom recurrence*.

For example, a resource works from 5:00 AM to 10:00 AM every Monday, and 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM every Wednesday.

## Work hour types

These APIs support create, update, and delete operations for the following work hour types:

- [Working hours](#working-hours)
- [Non-working hours](#non-working-hour)
- [Breaks](#break)
- [Time off](#time-off)
- [Business closure](#business-closure)

### Working hours

Working hours are times during which an entity is available to perform work.

Using these APIs, you can do the following:

-	Create, edit, or delete a working hour occurrence.
-	Create, edit, or delete a working hour daily recurrence.
-	Create, edit, or delete a working hour weekly recurrence.
-	Create, edit, or delete a working hour custom recurrence.
-	Create, edit, or delete all-day working hours.
-	Create or edit capacity on working hours.
-	Edit a single working hour occurrence in a recurrence.
-	Edit *This and Following occurrences* in a recurrence.
-	Change a working hour occurrence to a recurrence.
-	Change the time zone of the calendar rule.

Using this API, you can't do the following:

- Delete a single working hour occurrence from a recurrence.
- Create an occurrence that spans 24 hours but doesn't start and end at midnight (12:00 AM).
- Create, edit, or delete an all-day recurrence.

### Non-working hour

These are times during which the entity is unavailable to work due to an unspecified reason.

Using these APIs, you can do the following:

-	Create or edit all-day non-working hours.
-	Create or edit a non-working hour occurrence.
-	Change the time zone of the calendar rule.

Using these APIs, you can't do the following:

- Create or edit a non-working hour recurrence.

### Break

These are times in a working day during which an entity is taking a break and is unavailable for work. Breaks can't exist without working hours; they have to occur between two working hours in a day. Breaks can't overlap with working hours.  

Using these APIs, you can do the following:

- Create or edit breaks during working hours.

Using these APIs, you can't do the following:

- Delete only breaks from an occurrence or recurrence of working hours.


### Time off 

These are times during which an entity is unavailable to work due to a vacation. The reason for time off can be specified.

Using these APIs, you can do the following:

-	Create or edit time off with a label.
-	Change the time zone of the calendar rule.

Using these APIs, you can't do the following: 

- Create or edit a time-off hour recurrence.

### Business closure

You can [create business closure entities](/dynamics365/customer-service/set-when-business-closed-csh) that define the times the business will be closed. Using the `msdyn_SaveCalendar` API, you can set every entity to observe or ignore the organization's business closure times by using the optional [**ObserveClosure**](#calendareventinfo) key. When they're set to observe these closures, the entities will be unavailable for work.

## Save Calendar API

### Input

The request contains only one attribute&mdash;**CalendarEventInfo**, which is a **String** type. It contains several other attributes that are all embedded in this string.

> [!NOTE]
> In the following table, **Type** represents the format expected to make a successful request. However, the whole request is parsed as a single string.

#### CalendarEventInfo

| **Name**     | **Type**   | **Required**     | **Description** |
| :-------- | :--------- | :--------- | :----- |
|  EntityLogicalName | String   | Yes   | This key describes the entity from which the API is being called. The calendar of this entity is to be created or edited. |
| CalendarId  | GUID | Yes| This key contains the calendar ID related to the entity described above. When any of these entities are created, a calendar record is also automatically created. These APIs edit that calendar record by adding rules or editing existing rules.|
|RulesAndRecurrences	| RulesAndRecurrences	| Yes | This key is an array, and each element contains multiple attributes as listed in the table in the following section. The size of the array should be at least one.  |
| IsVaried	|Boolean	|No|	This key should be set to `true` for custom recurrence scenarios.|
|IsEdit|	Boolean|	No|	This key should be set to `true` for editing existing rules.|
| TimeZoneCode|	Integer|	No|	This key takes an integer value corresponding to the time zone for the calendar rules. For the mapping, go to [Time zone codes](#time-zone-codes), later in this topic. The default value is the user's time zone.
| InnerCalendarDescription|	String|	No|	This key is only needed if the calendar rule is for time off. It should contain the reason for the time off.| 
| ObserveClosure|	Boolean|	No|	This key is specific to recurrences. If it's set to `true`, the entity will observe business closure.|
|RecurrenceEndDate|	DateTime|	No|	This key is specific to recurrences. It contains the end date for the recurrence. If the timestamp is 08:00:00 or earlier, the recurrence end date is one day before the specified date. If the timestamp is 08:00:01 or later, the date is respected as-is. The default value for occurrences is null. The default value for recurrences is 30 Dec 9999, 23:59:59 hours, UTC<!--note from editor: Shouldn't this be in ISO 8601 format?-->.|
|RecurrenceSplit|	Boolean|	No|	This key is specific to recurrences. It's set to `true` for editing "This and following occurrences" of a recurrence.|
|ResourceId	| GUID |	No|	This key contains the **SystemUserId** or **ResourceId** and is only to be passed when the entity associated with this call is a bookable resource of type **SystemUser**. This is necessary to check for OwnCalendar privileges on the **Service Management** tab.

#### RulesAndRecurrences

|Name | Type | Required | Description |
| :-------- | :--------- | :--------- | :----- |
|Rules| Rules |	Yes |	This key is an array, and each element contains multiple attributes as listed in the table in the following section. The size of the array should be at least one. |
|RecurrencePattern|	String|	No|	This key is specific to recurrences. We currently only support this pattern: `FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=1;BYDAY=SU,MO,TU,WE,TH,FR,SA`. `BYDAY` can be changed to include fewer days; however, `FREQ` and `INTERVAL` can't be changed.| 
|InnerCalendarId|	GUID|	No|	This key is specific to editing. If a rule is being edited, the **InnerCalendarId** needs to be passed here. If an **InnerCalendarId** isn't passed, the API creates a new rule, even if the **IsEdit** key is set to true. |
|Action	|Integer|	No|	This key is specific to custom recurrences. If a custom recurrence is being created or edited, one of the following numbers should be entered:<ul><li>(1) Adding a day to the recurrence</li><li>(2)	Deleting a day from the recurrence</li><li>(3) Editing only the start or end dates or times, or editing capacity</li><li>(4) Editing anything other than the keys mentioned in (3)</li></ul>|

#### Rules

|Name	|Type|	Required|	Description|
| :-------- | :--------- | :--------- | :------ |
|StartTime|	DateTime|	Yes|	This key contains a datetime entry in [ISO format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601). For example, `\"2021-05-15T12:00:00.000Z\"`. The time portion determines the start time of the work hour in the time zone specified earlier. The date portion determines the start date of the work hour. Here, May 15, 2021 is the date of the occurrence or the starting date of the recurrence. If the pattern was `BYDAY=TU,WE`, but May 15 (a Saturday) is the date, the API will automatically create or edit rules for all Tuesdays and Wednesdays following May 15. This is case where the rule doesn't have to have the date corresponding to the day. | 
|EndTime|	DateTime|	Yes|	This contains a datetime entry in [ISO format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601). For example, `\"2021-05-15T12:00:00.000Z\"`. The time portion determines the end time of the work hour in the time zone specified earlier. The date portion *must* contain the same date as the date portion of the **StartTime**. The only exceptions are:<ul><li>If it's an all-day occurrence. In this case, the date portion should reflect the end date of the all-day occurrence.</li><li>The occurrence ends at the end of the day, that is, 12:00 AM of the following day. In this case, the date should be `\"2021-05-16T00:00:00.000Z\"`. To specify the end date of the recurrence, modify the **RecurrenceEndDate** attribute.</li></ul> |
|WorkHourType	|Integer|	Yes	|This key contains a number corresponding to one of the following options:<ul><li>(0) Working</li><li>(1) Break</li><li>(2) Non-working</li><li>(3) Time Off</li></ul>|
| Effort |	Integer	| No |	This key determines the capacity of the entity. It must be a whole number. The default value is 1. |

### Output

This POST API creates or modifies calendar rule records for the selected entity. It also gives the following output.

|**Name** |	**Type**|	**Description**|
|:--|:--|:--|
| InnerCalendarIds|	String |	An array of **InnerCalendarIds** GUIDs that are a result of the POST operation. |

## Delete Calendar API

### Input

|**Name** |	**Type**|	**Required**|	**Description**|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|EntityLogicalName|	String|	Yes	|This field describes the entity whose calendar rules are to be deleted.|
|InnerCalendarId|	GUID|	Yes|	This field describes the ID of the **InnerCalendarId** that needs to be deleted. If there are multiple **InnerCalendarIds** associated with a single rule, any one ID is sufficient here. More information about inner and outer calendars: [Calendar entities](/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/developer/calendar-entities) |
|CalendarId	|GUID	|Yes|	This field describes the **CalendarId** of the entity. |
|IsVaried	|Boolean	|No	|This field is specific to recurrences, and is set to `yes` if a custom recurrence rule is being deleted. |

### Output

This POST API deletes calendar rule records for the selected entity. Additionally, it gives the following output.

|Name |	Type|	Description|
|:--|:--|:--|
|InnerCalendarIds|	String|	An array of **InnerCalendarIds** GUIDs that are a result of the POST operation.|

## How to call the APIs

These APIs can be called by using the browser.

1. Open the browser and the org in which you need to make these calendar changes.
2. Open Developer Tools (select **Ctrl**+**Shift**+**I** in Microsoft Edge, select **F12** in Google Chrome).
3. In the console, enter the following function, after replacing [org-name] with org details (for example, `http://your_org.crm.dynamics.com`):

```
       function CalendarAction(action, data) {
           let req = new XMLHttpRequest();
           req.open("POST", "**[org-name]**/api/data/v9.0/" + action, true);
           req.setRequestHeader("OData-MaxVersion", "4.0");
           req.setRequestHeader("OData-Version", "4.0");
           req.setRequestHeader("Accept", "application/json");
           req.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/json; charset=utf-8");
           req.setRequestHeader("Prefer", 'odata.include-annotations="*"');
           req.onreadystatechange = function () {
               if (this.readyState === 4) {
                   req.onreadystatechange = null;
                   if(this.status == 200) {
                       console.log(JSON.parse(this.response));
                   } else {
                       console.error(JSON.parse(this.response));
                   }
               }
           };
           req.send(JSON.stringify(data));
       }
```

4. After this function is defined, you can call it to create, edit, or delete calendars by using the APIs. Enter the following call:

```
       CalendarAction("msdyn_SaveCalendar", {"CalendarEventInfo":"{\"CalendarId\":\"df0857c4-50f5-4576-8e89-f236670ad2d5\",\"EntityLogicalName\":\"bookableresource\", \"TimeZoneCode\":92,\"StartDate\":\"2021-04-25T00:00:00.000Z\",\"IsVaried\":false,\"RulesAndRecurrences\":[{\"Rules\":[{\"StartTime\":\"2021-04-25T08:00:00.000Z\",\"EndTime\":\"2021-04-25T17:00:00.000Z\",\"Duration\":540,\"Effort\":1}]}]}"})
```

See the following section for examples of how to make different calls based on your needs. Replace the `action` of the function call in step 3 with `msdyn_SaveCalendar` or `msdyn_DeleteCalendar`, and replace `data` with the relevant `CalendarEventInfo`.

## Example scenarios for API usage

Let's walk through some scenarios that you can use these APIs for.

Bob and Tim are delivery truck drivers for Contoso Enterprises in Bellevue, Washington. Their dispatcher, Debbie, is responsible for making changes to their work hour calendars. Debbie makes these changes by using the `msdyn_SaveCalendar` and `msdyn_DeleteCalendar` APIs.

### Create a working hour occurrence.

Bob is scheduled to drive around to deliver packages from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM on May 15, 2021. Debbie uses the `msdyn_SaveCalendar` API.

**Request**

} `
```


### Edit a working hour daily recurrence with increased capacity

Bob decides to stop working for the entire week of June 15, 2021 because he needs a break. Until then, he'll continue the all-week schedule he previously agreed to. Debbie makes these changes by using the `msdyn_SaveCalendar` API.

**Request**

```
> `  {
 "CalendarEventInfo": "{\"CalendarId\":\"d33263c7-c16b-4e3e-a56a-20f7a66cafc1\",\"EntityLogicalName\":\"bookableresource\",\"TimeZoneCode\":5,\"RecurrenceEndDate\":\"2021-06-15T00:00:00.000Z\",\"RulesAndRecurrences\":[{\"Rules\":[{\"StartTime\":\"2021-05-20T08:00:00.000Z\",\"EndTime\":\"2021-05-20T17:00:00.000Z\",\"Effort\":1,\"WorkHourType\":0}],\"InnerCalendarId\":\"20f6cfa7-cfbe-eb11-a81d-000d3a6e4359\",\"RecurrencePattern\":\"FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=1;BYDAY=SU,MO,TU,WE,TH,FR,SA\"}]}"

### Create a working hour weekly recurrence

Starting from June 16, 2021, Bob will work from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM on Wednesdays and Fridays. He takes a break from 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM for lunch. Debbie uses the `msdyn_SaveCalendar` API. But oops, she makes a mistake and schedules the break from 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM.

**Request**

```
>  ` {
  "CalendarEventInfo": "{\"CalendarId\":\"d33263c7-c16b-4e3e-a56a-20f7a66cafc1\",\"EntityLogicalName\":\"bookableresource\",\"TimeZoneCode\":5,\"RulesAndRecurrences\":[{\"Rules\":[{\"StartTime\":\"2021-06-16T08:00:00.000Z\",\"EndTime\":\"2021-06-16T12:00:00.000Z\",\"Effort\":1,\"WorkHourType\":0}, {\"StartTime\":\"2021-06-16T12:00:00.000Z\",\"EndTime\":\"2021-06-16T13:00:00.000Z\",\"Effort\":null,\"WorkHourType\":1}, {\"StartTime\":\"2021-06-16T13:00:00.000Z\",\"EndTime\":\"2021-06-16T17:00:00.000Z\",\"Effort\":1,\"WorkHourType\":0}],\"RecurrencePattern\":\"FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=1;BYDAY=WE,TH,FR\"}]}"

Debbie then corrects her mistake and changes the break to occur from 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM by using the `msdyn_SaveCalendar` API.

**Request**

```
> `  {
  "CalendarEventInfo": "{\"CalendarId\":\"d33263c7-c16b-4e3e-a56a-20f7a66cafc1\",\"EntityLogicalName\":\"bookableresource\",\"IsEdit\":\"true\",\"TimeZoneCode\":5,\"RulesAndRecurrences\":[{\"Rules\":[{\"StartTime\":\"2021-06-15T08:00:00.000Z\",\"EndTime\":\"2021-06-15T12:00:00.000Z\",\"Effort\":1,\"WorkHourType\":0}, {\"StartTime\":\"2021-06-15T12:00:00.000Z\",\"EndTime\":\"2021-06-15T12:30:00.000Z\",\"Effort\":null,\"WorkHourType\":1}, {\"StartTime\":\"2021-06-15T12:30:00.000Z\",\"EndTime\":\"2021-06-15T17:00:00.000Z\",\"Effort\":1,\"WorkHourType\":0}],\"InnerCalendarId\":\"1f894441-d0be-eb11-a81d-000d3a6e4359\",\"RecurrencePattern\":\"FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=1;BYDAY=WE,TH,FR\"}]}"

```

### Create a working hour custom recurrence

Tim works for Contoso on Mondays from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, and Wednesdays from 11:00 AM to 3:00 PM. He started his role on May 16, 2021. Debbie uses the `msdyn_SaveCalendar` API to create Tim's work hours.

**Request**

```
> `  {
"CalendarEventInfo": "{\"CalendarId\":\"a68245c9-ba2e-4496-9c18-3bee75fda396\",\"EntityLogicalName\":\"bookableresource\",\"TimeZoneCode\":5,\"IsVaried\":true,\"RulesAndRecurrences\":[{\"Rules\":[{\"StartTime\":\"2021-05-16T08:00:00.000Z\",\"EndTime\":\"2021-05-16T17:00:00.000Z\",\"Effort\":1,\"WorkHourType\":0}],\"Action\":1,\"RecurrencePattern\":\"FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=1;BYDAY=MO\"},{\"Rules\":[{\"StartTime\":\"2021-05-16T11:00:00.000Z\",\"EndTime\":\"2021-05-16T15:00:00.000Z\",\"Effort\":1,\"WorkHourType\":0}],\"Action\":1,\"RecurrencePattern\":\"FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=1;BYDAY=WE\"}]}"
}`
```

**Response**

```
> ` {
  "InnerCalendarIds": "[\"9fb8c199-d1be-eb11-a81d-000d3a6e4359\", \"a2b8c199-d1be-eb11-a81d-000d3a6e4359\"]"
}`
```


### Edit a working hour custom recurrence

Tim's schedule then changes: his work hours are now Wednesdays 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM, and Thursday 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM. Monday is removed from his schedule. Debbie uses the `msdyn_SaveCalendar` API to achieve this.

**Request**

## FAQs

**I'm getting the error, "StartTime cannot be greater or equal to EndTime."**

Make sure there are no overlaps in the time slots of the different calendar rules. Check the dates to make sure **StartTime** isn't later than **EndTime**. Also, verify that the times follow the 24-hour format. 

**Can the APIs be used to update the "Work Hour Templates" entity?**

Yes, you can use this API to create and update work hour templates in addition to resource work hours.

**I'm getting the error, "There was an error deserializing the object of type Microsoft.Dynamics.UCICalendar.Plugins.SaveCalendarContract+CalendarEventInfo. The input source is not correctly formatted.**<br>
or<br>**Expecting state 'Element'.. Encountered 'Text' with name '', namespace ''."**

Make sure that the string is parsed correctly. There might be missing brackets, commas, or semicolons.

**I'm getting the error, "Invalid recurrence pattern. Please refer to the documentation for supported patterns."**

We currently only support this pattern: `FREQ=DAILY;INTERVAL=1;BYDAY=SU,MO,TU,WE,TH,FR,SA`. `BYDAY` can be changed to include fewer days; however, `FREQ` and `INTERVAL` can't be changed. Make sure there are no spaces in the pattern.

**How do we get information of the CalendarId and the InnerCalendarId of the resource?**
The `CalendarId` can be retrieved from resource attributes. Make this call to get this information: `[org-url]/api/data/v9.1/bookableresources([bookableresourceGUID])`. 

An example of the previous call would be `http://aurorav69662.aurorav69662dom.extest.microsoft.com/CITTest/api/data/v9.1/bookableresources(7bb0224b-6712-ec11-94f9-000d3a6d888e)`.

The `InnerCalendarId` can be retrieved from calendar attributes. Make this call to get this information: `[org-url]/api/data/v9.1/calendars([calendar-id-from-above-call])?$expand=calendar_calendar_rules`. 

An example of the previous call is `http://aurorav69662.aurorav69662dom.extest.microsoft.com/CITTest/api/data/v9.1/calendars(02481736-1b6a-4d49-9ebd-a5bd041c1c99)?$expand=calendar_calendar_rules`.

**What happens if there are overlapping rules?** 

There are a couple different ranks that rules fall under: 

- *Rank 1* - daily occurrence (working/non-working), and time off occurrence. 
- *Rank 0* - weekly recurrence (working/non-working). 
 
**_It's best to avoid overlapping rules or multiple rules of the same type on the same calendar day, and instead edit existing rules to make changes._** 

But if they do exist, this is how it will be handled: 

- The Rank 1 rules have a higher priority than Rank 0 rules. So if there were two rules (one of each rank) on the same day, the daily occurrence or time-off occurrence will take the priority over the weekly recurrence. 
- If there are two rules of the same rank, the rule that was most recently created/ modified will be the one that is considered for the resource's calendar. 
- Keep in mind that all-day occurrences are of Rank 1, so you may want to consider changing it to a weekly recurrence in order to be able to add occurrence work hours and have them be respected. 
- When a working hour exists and a time off occurrence is created overlapping it, the rules split in a way that ensures the time off is respected, and any remaining time as working hours will stay as is. For example, if there are working hours from 8 AM to 5 PM on September 21, and a time-off occurrence is added from 3 PM to 7 PM on September 21, this would be resolved as working hours as 8 PM to 3 PM and time off from 3 PM to 7 PM. However, if the rules were created in the opposite order (time off created first and then working hours were created) regardless of the timeslots, only the working hour would be reselected. The time off would be overridden.
