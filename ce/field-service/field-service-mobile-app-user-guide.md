[!INCLUDE[pn_fieldservice_mobile_app_long](../includes/pn-fieldservice-mobile-app-long.md)] (mobile) give your field agents all the information they need to get to a customer location and complete work orders  quickly.  
  
 Before you can start using [!INCLUDE[pn_fieldservice_mobile_app_short](../includes/pn-fieldservice-mobile-app-short.md)] (mobile), your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] administrator will need to install a mobile solution. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Install the Field Service mobile app](../field-service/install-the-mobile-app.md)   
  
<a name="bkmk_install"></a>   
## Install the mobile app  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_fieldservice_mobile_app_short](../includes/pn-fieldservice-mobile-app-short.md)] (mobile) is supported on the following devices:  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_windows_10](../includes/pn-windows-10.md)]

 ![Download the Field Service Mobile app](../field-service/media/field-service-download-mobile-app.png "Download the Field Service Mobile app")  
  
<a name="bkmk_signin"></a>   
## Sign in  
 Now that you've installed [!INCLUDE[pn_fieldservice_mobile_app_short](../includes/pn-fieldservice-mobile-app-short.md)] (mobile), let's get started! First, you need to sign in. You'll need your [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] web address, user name, and password. If you don't have any of these, contact your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] admin.

-   To work offline, tap the Online/Offline Mode button.  This is how the button looks when you’re offline.

## For field agents  
 Field agents can use the mobile app to review work orders and get all the information they need to complete the job.  
  
### Review work order bookings  
 When a work order is assigned to you, it shows up in [!INCLUDE[pn_fieldservice_mobile_app_short](../includes/pn-fieldservice-mobile-app-short.md)] (mobile).  
  
 By default, you can only see work orders for the current day plus the next 7 days, that have a status of scheduled, traveling, or in progress. Once a work order is completed, you can no longer see it in [!INCLUDE[pn_fieldservice_mobile_app_short](../includes/pn-fieldservice-mobile-app-short.md)] (mobile).

 ![View work order](../field-service/media/field-service-view-work-order.PNG "View work order")  
  
### See the location of a work order on a map  
  
1.  Open the work order, and then tap **Map**. This shows the location of the work order on a map.

 ![Work order map view](../field-service/media/field-service-work-order-map-view.PNG "Work order map view")  
  
### Update the work order status  
 The minute you start driving to the next job, it’s important to update the status of the work order. This keeps the dispatcher up to date on what’s going on with the work order, and lets the dispatch team provide the customer with the current status.  
  
1.  Open the work order, and then tap **Booking**.  
  
2.  Tap Add button for **Booking Status**.

    > [!NOTE]
    >  When the work order is complete, remember to mark it as **Completed**.  
  
### Update the work order start time  
 When a dispatcher schedules a work order, the booking will have a start and end time. This may be the time promised to the customer, but if you’re running late or the job is taking longer than expected, it’s important to update the start and end time. This automatically keeps the dispatcher up to date on the schedule board.  
  
-   Open the work order, tap **Booking**, and then change the **Start Time**.
