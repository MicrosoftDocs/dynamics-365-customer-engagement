# Create work order types (Field Service)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

A work order type in [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_field_service](../includes/pn-dyn-365-field-service.md)] helps you categorize and build different types of work orders, such as installation, preventative maintenance, repair, sales, quote, and so on. When you  create a work order type, it also helps separate work order information into views, reports, and dashboards on the schedule board.  
  
1.  From the main menu, click **Field Service** > **Administration**, and then choose **Work Order Types**.  
  
2.  On the **Active Work Order Types** screen, click **New** in the upper left corner.  
  
3.  Use the tooltips to help fill in information, and then click **Save & Close**.
