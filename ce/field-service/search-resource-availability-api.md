# Search resource availability API

Field service organizations always have work coming in that needs to be scheduled, either by a service agent on the phone or directly by the customer through their website. Booking creation is typically based on the resources available to the company and the requirements of the work.

When using Dynamics 365 Field Service v8.8.43.51 and Universal Resource Scheduling v3.12.46.21 to schedule work, the `msdyn_SearchResourceAvailability` API can be used to retrieve all the eligible resources for the job, to allow for efficient scheduling of the work. At the time of writing, v3 is the latest version of msdyn_SearchResourceAvailability and supports web API calls. 

## Input parameters

| Name | Type | Description | Required | Default
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Version | String | The version number of the API identifies the version of the API that should be invoked. It follows the format of major.minor.patch. The request doesn't have to contain the complete version number. <p> <li> If only a major version is specified, it invokes the highest minor and patch version available for that major version. <li> If both major and minor versions are specified, it invokes the highest patch version available. <li> If all three parts of the version are mentioned, it will invoke the exact version of the API specified.</ul>| Yes | -N/A-
| IsWebApi | Boolean | Set this to _True_ in order to use the SA via the web API. | Yes | -N/A-
| Requirement | Entity | This attribute specifies the resource requirement for which resource availability is being retrieved. This is expected to be a msdyn_resourcerequirement type entity. The requirement can be a pre-existing record from the database, or one created on the fly with the necessary constraints. The entity should contain all the specifics that are relevant for your search. The `@odata.type` for this entity should be `Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.msdyn_requirement`. The following some important attributes to populate: <ol> <li>**msdyn_fromdate** (_DateTime_): Requirement's from date in ISO format <li> **msdyn_todate** (_DateTime_): Requirement's to date in ISO format <li> **msdyn_remainingduration** (_Integer_): The remaining duration of the requirement in minutes <li> **msdyn_duration** (_Integer_): The total duration of the requirement in minutes | Yes | -N/A-
| [Settings](#settings-entity) | Entity | The settings attribute helps to filter the retrieved resources further. Settings are specified as attributes in an entity bag. The type of entity does not matter, you can specify any entity logical name.  | Yes | -N/A-
| [ResourceSpecification](#resource-specification-entity) | Entity | The `resourceSpecification` attribute is defined as attributes in an entity bag. The `@odata.type` for this entity should be `Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.expando`. | No | None |

### Settings entity
  
The settings entity is not an entity that exists in the Dataverse; however, it's a collection of all the following attributes that helps the schedule assistant API filter results. Thus, the `@odata.type` for this entity should be `Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.expando`.

| Name | Type | Description | Required | Default
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ConsiderSlotsWithLessThanRequiredCapacity | Boolean | Set this to _True_ if a time slot with less than the required capacity (effort) should be considered when computing potential available time slots on the resource's calendar. | No | False
| ConsiderSlotsWithLessThanRequiredDuration | Boolean | Set this to _True_ if a time slot with less than the required duration should be considered when computing potential available time slots on the resource's calendar. | No | False
| ConsiderSlotsWithOverlappingBooking | Boolean | Set this to _True_ if a time slot with overlapping bookings should be considered when computing potential available time slots on the resource's calendar. | No | False
| ConsiderSlotsWithProposedBookings | Boolean | Set this to _True_ if a time slot with proposed bookings should be considered when computing potential available time slots on the resource's calendar. | No | False
| ConsiderTravelTime | Boolean | Set this to _True_ if travel time should be considered when computing potential time slots on the resource's calendar. | No | True
| MovePastStartDateToCurrentDate | Boolean | Set this to _True_ to move a start date in the past to the current date. | No | False
| UseRealTimeResourceLocation | Boolean | Set this to _True_ if the real-time location of resources should be used when computing potential time slots on the resource's calendar. | No | False
| SortOrder | Entity | The sort order can be specified using an entity collection. Each entity in the collection will represent one sort criteria. The `@odata.type` for this entity should be `Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.expando`. The following are the attributes you need to populate: <ol> <li> **Name** (_String_): The sort criteria <li>**SortOrder** (_Integer_): The sort direction (0 for ascending and 1 for descending) | No | None
| MaxResourceTravelRadius | Entity | This attribute specifies the maximum This attribute can be defined in an Entity. The `@odata.type` for this entity should be `Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.expando`. The following are the attributes you need to populate: <ol> <li> **Value** (_Decimal_): The radius <li> **Unit** (_Integer_): The distance unit. See msdyn_distance unit option set for possible values. | No| 0 km
| MaxNumberOfResourcesToEvaluate | Integer | This attribute defines a limit on the number of resources that are considered for the request. | No | Resource Availability Retrieval Limit from schedulable entity definition

### Resource specification entity

| Name | Type | Description | Required | Default
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ResourceTypes | EntityCollection | This attribute specifies the resource type required for the requirement. It can be specified using an entity collection. Each entity in the collection will represent one bookable resource type. The `@odata.type` for this entity should be `Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.msdyn_resourceType`. This is the attribute required: <ol> <li> **Value** (_Integer_): The option set value that represents the resource type: <ul> <li> 1- Generic <li> 2- Contact <li> 3- User <li> 4- Equipment <li> 5- Account <li> 6- Crew <li> 7- Facility <li> 8- Pools | No | All resource types except crews
| PreferredResources | EntityCollection | This attribute specifies the resources preferred for the requirement. Adding resources to this entity collection ensures that they are at the top of the list of available resources. Even resources that are not a part of the entity collection will be on the list, but only after the preferred resources. | No | None
| RestrictedResources | EntityCollection | This attribute specifies the resources that should not be considered for the requirement. All time slots of this resource will be filtered out of the list of results from this API.  | No| None
| MustChooseFromResources | EntityCollection | This attribute specifies the only resources that can be on the list of available resources. It will filter out all the other results from the output list.
| Constraints | Entity | This attribute specifies the additional constraints that should be applied to the retrieval of available resources. | No| None
| RetrieveResourcesQueryId | Guid | The Id for the Retrieve Resources query. | No| The default Retrieve Resource Query Id.
| BookedResourceId | Guid | This attribute specifies the resource currently booked for the requirement. | No| None

> [!Note] 
> The **Preferred**/ **Restricted** / **MustChooseFrom** resources attributes can be specified using an entity collection of bookable resource entities. Each entity in the collection will represent one **Preferred** / **Restricted** / **MustChooseFrom** resource. This is the attribute required for them: <ol> <li> **Value** (_Guid_): The bookable resource ID of the **Preferred** / **Restricted** / **MustChooseFrom** resource. The `@odata.type` for this entity should be `Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.msdyn_bookableresource`.
  
#### Constraints

Additional constraints can be specified through attributes in this entity. The type of entity does not matter, you can specify any entity logical name.

Review the ‘Retrieve Resources Query’ on the schedule board settings to identify which constraints might apply. By default, it includes the following:

| Name | Type | Description |

## Output parameters

At the highest level, the output has the following four parameters. The results are represented in entity collections and entities. Responses may not include all the attributes described here as null value or not NA values are omitted from the response. Always check for the presence of an attribute before trying to access it.

## Examples
  
In this example, v3 of schedule assistant API which allows for web API calls is being used for a requirement of duration 60 minutes. Using the settings attribute, the results are being filtered down. Two resource types are being considered for the final results: 1 and 2 (in other words, generic and contact).

                "@odata.type": "Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.expando",

                "value": "1"

            },

            {

                "@odata.type": "Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.expando",

                "value": "2"

            }

        ]

    }

}
```

The following examples makes use of the XrmSDK to work with the `msdyn_SearchResourceAvailabilityRequest` and `msdyn_SearchResourceAvailabilityResponse` classes. The first example queries the availability of a specific Bookable Resource by using the 'MustChooseFromResources' attribute in the Resource specification entity:
```
// Specify a Resource Requirement for which you want to query resource availability
msdyn_resourcerequirement rr = new msdyn_resourcerequirement();
rr.msdyn_fromdate = new DateTime(2022, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0);
rr.msdyn_todate = new DateTime(2022, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0);
rr.msdyn_RemainingDuration = 2 * 480;
rr.msdyn_duration = 3 * 480;

// Define the Settings input parameter
Entity settings = new Entity(); // type of entity does not matter
settings.Attributes.Add("ConsiderSlotsWithLessThanRequiredCapacity", false);
settings.Attributes.Add("ConsiderSlotsWithLessThanRequiredDuration", false);
settings.Attributes.Add("ConsiderSlotsWithOverlappingBooking", false);
settings.Attributes.Add("ConsiderSlotsWithProposedBookings", false);
settings.Attributes.Add("ConsiderTravelTime	", false);

// Define the ResourceSpecification parameter
Entity resourceSpecification = new Entity();    // type of entity does not matter

// Initialize EntityCollections for the ResourceSpecification entity
EntityCollection mustChooseCollection = new EntityCollection();

// Add bookable resource for which you want to query timeslots to the mustChooseCollection
Entity resource = new Entity("bookableresource");
resource.Attributes.Add("value", new Guid("8A54A324-43A1-4875-9F87-EFB34640B260"));
mustChooseCollection.Entities.Add(resource);
resourceSpecification.Attributes.Add("MustChooseFromResources", mustChooseCollection);

// Execute the request
msdyn_SearchResourceAvailabilityRequest request = new msdyn_SearchResourceAvailabilityRequest()
{
    Version = "2",
    IsWebApi = false,
    Requirement = rr,
    Settings = settings,
    ResourceSpecification = resourceSpecification,
};
msdyn_SearchResourceAvailabilityResponse response = (msdyn_SearchResourceAvailabilityResponse)manager.OrganizationService.Execute(request);

// Print out basic timeslot information from the response
IEnumerable<Entity> availableSlots = response.TimeSlots.Entities.Where(_ => (int)_.Attributes["Type"] == 0);
System.Console.WriteLine($"Amount of available timeslots: {availableSlots.Count()}");
IEnumerable<Entity> scheduledSlots = response.TimeSlots.Entities.Where(_ => (int)_.Attributes["Type"] == 1);
System.Console.WriteLine($"Amount of scheduled timeslots: {scheduledSlots.Count()}");
IEnumerable<Entity> offSlots = response.TimeSlots.Entities.Where(_ => (int)_.Attributes["Type"] == 2);
System.Console.WriteLine($"Amount of off timeslots: {offSlots.Count()}");
IEnumerable<Entity> breakSlots = response.TimeSlots.Entities.Where(_ => (int)_.Attributes["Type"] == 3);
System.Console.WriteLine($"Amount of break timeslots: {breakSlots.Count()}");
```
  
The second example queries resource availability of all Generic, Contact and User resource types by using the 'ResourceTypes' attribute in the Resource specification entity:
```
// Specify a Resource Requirement for which you want to query resource availability
msdyn_resourcerequirement rr = new msdyn_resourcerequirement();
rr.msdyn_fromdate = new DateTime(2022, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0);
rr.msdyn_todate = new DateTime(2022, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0);
rr.msdyn_RemainingDuration = 2 * 480;
rr.msdyn_duration = 3 * 480;

// Define the Settings input parameter
Entity settings = new Entity(); // type of entity does not matter
settings.Attributes.Add("ConsiderSlotsWithLessThanRequiredCapacity", false);
settings.Attributes.Add("ConsiderSlotsWithLessThanRequiredDuration", false);
settings.Attributes.Add("ConsiderSlotsWithOverlappingBooking", false);
settings.Attributes.Add("ConsiderSlotsWithProposedBookings", false);
settings.Attributes.Add("ConsiderTravelTime	", false);

// Define the ResourceSpecification parameter
Entity resourceSpecification = new Entity();    // type of entity does not matter

// Initialize EntityCollections for the ResourceSpecification entity
EntityCollection resourceTypeCollection = new EntityCollection();

// Add Resource Types for which you want to query timeslots
Entity genericResourceType = new Entity();
genericResourceType.Attributes.Add("value", 1);
Entity contactResourceType = new Entity();
contactResourceType.Attributes.Add("value", 2);
Entity userResourceType = new Entity();
userResourceType.Attributes.Add("value", 3);
resourceTypeCollection.Entities.AddRange(genericResourceType, contactResourceType, userResourceType);
resourceSpecification.Attributes.Add("ResourceTypes", resourceTypeCollection);

// Execute the request+
msdyn_SearchResourceAvailabilityRequest request = new msdyn_SearchResourceAvailabilityRequest()
{
    Version = "2",
    IsWebApi = false,
    Requirement = rr,
    Settings = settings,
    ResourceSpecification = resourceSpecification,
};
msdyn_SearchResourceAvailabilityResponse response = (msdyn_SearchResourceAvailabilityResponse)manager.OrganizationService.Execute(request);

// Print out basic timeslot information from the response
IEnumerable<Entity> availableSlots = response.TimeSlots.Entities.Where(_ => (int)_.Attributes["Type"] == 0);
System.Console.WriteLine($"Amount of available timeslots: {availableSlots.Count()}");
IEnumerable<Entity> scheduledSlots = response.TimeSlots.Entities.Where(_ => (int)_.Attributes["Type"] == 1);
System.Console.WriteLine($"Amount of scheduled timeslots: {scheduledSlots.Count()}");
IEnumerable<Entity> offSlots = response.TimeSlots.Entities.Where(_ => (int)_.Attributes["Type"] == 2);
System.Console.WriteLine($"Amount of off timeslots: {offSlots.Count()}");
IEnumerable<Entity> breakSlots = response.TimeSlots.Entities.Where(_ => (int)_.Attributes["Type"] == 3);
System.Console.WriteLine($"Amount of break timeslots: {breakSlots.Count()}");
```
