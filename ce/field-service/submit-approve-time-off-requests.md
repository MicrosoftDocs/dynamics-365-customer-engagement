# Submit and approve time-off requests (Field Service)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Keep the schedule board in [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_field_service](../includes/pn-dyn-365-field-service.md)] up to date by logging time-off requests.  
  
 For example, if one of your field technicians is taking a vacation, it's important to log the request so that a dispatcher can see the time-off request on the schedule board when scheduling a work order.  
  
 When a resource has an approved time-off request, the scheduling assistant will not recommend that resource for a job in that time period, and the time slots for that resource will be grayedout on the schedule board to provide a visual notification to the dispatchers that the resource is not scheduled to be available during that time period.  
  
 If a bookable resource is set to require time-off approval, then when a time-off request is created for that resource, an approval request will be sent to that user's manager, before the time-off request is reflected in the schedule assistant and on the schedule board.
