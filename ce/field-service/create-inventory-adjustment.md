# Add or subtract inventory from a warehouse (Field Service)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

You can do an inventory adjustment in [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_field_service](../includes/pn-dyn-365-field-service.md)] to add or subtract inventory to or from a warehouse.  
  
Let's say you're getting a new shipment of  Product A that you're going to add to Warehouse 1. In this case you would create a new inventory adjustment record and specify the warehouse. Next you'll add the product to the inventory adjustment record and specify the product, unit, and quantity.  
  
<a name="BKMK_1"></a>   
## Step 1: Create an inventory adjustment  
  
1.  From the main menu, click **Field Service** > **Inventory Adjustments**.  
  
2.  On the **Active Inventory Adjustment** screen, click **+New**.  
  
3.  Choose the **Warehouse** where the inventory will be added or subtracted.  
  
4.  Choose who is making the adjustment:  
  
    -   If you're making the inventory adjustment, choose your name in the **Adjusted By Resource** field.  
  
    -   If another resource requested the adjustment, choose their name in the **Adjusted By Resource** field.  
  
5.  Click **Save**.

## Step 2: Add products to the inventory adjustment  
  
1.  From the top menu, click the drop-down arrow next to the item you created, and then click **Products**.  
  
2.  Click **+Add New Inventory Adjustment Product**.  
  
3.  Fill in the **Product**, **Unit**, and **Quantity**.  
  
4.  Click **Save & Close**.
