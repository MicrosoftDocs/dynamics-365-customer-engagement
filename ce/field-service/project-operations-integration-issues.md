# Known issues and limitations

## Limitations

- For material-enabled projects, task-based billing isn't supported. Specifically, project contract lines with **Include tasks** set to *Selected project tasks only* are excluded.
- **Discount amounts** aren't supported, but **Discount percentages** are. Existing **Discount amounts** that Field Service created before the integration are converted to **Discount percentages**, which can occasionally be off due to rounding issues.
- Estimated discounts aren't supported.
- In an integrated environment, Project Operations doesn't support project [production orders](/dynamics365/business-central/production-about-production-orders). However, consumption of bill of material items or finished goods through standard inventory scenarios is still supported.
- Migration from the legacy finance and operations integration isn't supported.
- Mobile offline profiles that the integration installs are active regardless of whether the [Field Service Integration with Project Operations toggle](project-operations-integration-setup.md#enable-the-integration) is enabled or not. These profiles override the out-of-the-box profiles.
- Actuals that the integration produce aren't associated to the work order that they came from. This design choice distinguishes the fact that they're actually generated by and for a project, from Project Operations, and not from Field Service.
- If the technician updating the work order product or work order service doesn't already have an associated *BookableResource*, the system automatically creates one to support integration and ensure accurate tracking of generated actuals. To maintain data accuracy, consider proactively [creating a BookableResource](set-up-bookable-resources.md) for each user who creates or updates work order lines.
- By design, work order services use the [*Material* transaction class](/dynamics365/project-operations/actuals/businesstransactions) and appear in Finance as *Item* transactions.

## Known issues

### Unable to approve Material Usage Log for stocked products

When you attempt to approve material usage records that involve stocked products, you might receive an error. The error occurs because Project Operations asynchronously calls a virtual table, which leads to a failure when retrieving Project On-Hand inventory data. Learn more in [Configuring the asynchronous threshold for approval sets](/dynamics365/project-operations/approvals/approval-sets#configuring-the-asynchronous-threshold-for-approval-sets).

To fix the issue, perform the following steps:

1. In Project Operations, go to the **Settings** area.

1. Select **Parameters** and open the only record.

1. Under the **Modern Approvals** section, enter any value above zero in the **Background Approval Threshold** field and then save.

1. Approve the Material Usage Logs. All future Material Usage Logs will automatically be approved if the **Auto-Approve Project Approval** setting is enabled.

### Cost Actual might occasionally differ from Cost Journal Line

If you [Integrated Project Operations deployment model](project-operations-integration-inventory.md), updates to Cost Actuals can come from Finance, resulting in Cost Actuals with Extended Amounts that are different from their parallel Cost Journal Line. This difference is expected and is caused by your costing parameters in Finance that sometimes result in needed adjustments to Actuals. For example, weighted averages or FIFO costs can be different from the more static cost on a price list. Learn more in [Inventory cost for material usage](/dynamics365/project-operations/procurement/stock-material-reservation#inventory-cost-for-material-usage).
