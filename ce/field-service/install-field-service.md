# How to install Dynamics 365 Field Service

This article describes how to install the Dynamics 365 Field Service application for Dynamics 365 (online). 

## Prerequisites

To follow the steps in this article, you will need: 

- Time. Field Service installations and upgrades can take up to 30 minutes or more. 
- A desktop browser and a mobile device (phone, tablet, or Windows 10 device).

## Step 1: Install Dynamics 365 Field Service

There are a few ways you can get access to Dynamics 365 Field Service: 

- Sign up for an entirely new trial environment. Head to [the Dynamics 365 trials site](https://trials.dynamics.com), select **Field Service**, and follow the instructions.

- Purchase Field Service by going to your **Microsoft 365 admin center** > **Billing** > **Purchase Services** and select **Dynamics 365 Field Service** and **Buy Now**. You can also get Field Service from this [Dynamics 365 purchasing page](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/pricing/#FieldService).

- Add a Field Service trial to an existing Dynamics 365 organization by going to **Settings** > **Microsoft AppSource**. Search for **Field Service trial**, select **Dynamics 365 Field Service trial**, and then select **Free Trial**.

### Verify the installation is complete

If the installation is complete, the "Field Service" and "Field Service Mobile" apps will appear in the list of apps when you sign in. You can find these apps by going to:
