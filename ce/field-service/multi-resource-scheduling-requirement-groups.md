# Schedule work with multiple requirements using requirement group

[!INCLUDE[multi-resource](../shared/urs/multi-resource-scheduling.md)]

## Requirement groups for field service scenarios

Requirement group templates are designed to work with [incident types](configure-incident-types.md). Associate a requirement group template to an incident type to automatically add requirement groups to work orders. Requirement groups can influence the performance for creating work orders and work order incidents. The degree of influence depends on the number of requirements in a requirement group.

1. In Field Service, open the **Settings** area. Under **Work Orders**, select **Incident Types**.

1. Select an incident type, open the **Related** > **Requirement Groups** tab, and select **New Incident Type Requirement Group**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Incident types with characteristics can't relate to requirement group templates. Associate the characteristics with requirements in the group instead.

1. Enter a **Name** and choose a **Requirement Group Template** to associate the template with the incident type. Then select **Save and Close**.

1. After saving the record, [add the incident type to a work order](configure-incident-types.md#add-an-incident-type-to-a-work-order).

You can now book the work order.

> [!NOTE]
> When requirement groups perform onsite work, the schedule assistant looks for groups of resources that can arrive at the same time, not resources that can begin traveling at the same time.
