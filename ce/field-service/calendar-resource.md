# Apply a calendar to a resource in Dynamics 365 Field Service

Once you’ve created a work hours template, you need to assign it to resources so their calendars reflect the working hours specified in the template.  
  
1. Go to **Field Service** > **Resources**.  
  
2. Select the resource you want to set the calendar for. You can select more than one resource.  
  
3. Select **Set Calendar**.  
  
4. Choose the work hours template you want to apply.  
  
5. Select **Apply**.
