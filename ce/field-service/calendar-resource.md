# Apply a calendar to a resource

Once you've created a work hours template, you need to assign it to resources so their calendars reflect the working hours specified in the template.  
  
1. Go to **Field Service** > **Resources**.  
  
2. Select the resource you want to set the calendar for. You can select more than one resource, but because of performance constraints, the maximum number of resources that you can select is 25.  
  
3. Select **Set Calendar**.  
  
4. Choose the work hours template you want to apply.  
  
5. Select **Apply**.
