# Specify skills for resources (Field Service)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Characteristics are skills that resources possess. For example, they can be used to indicate a license or certification is needed for certain types of work.  
  
 Adding characteristics to work orders allows you to document which knowledge or expertise is needed by a resource to complete the job, and to filter the list of available resources to those that have the matching characteristics when scheduling the work order.

## Add characteristics  
  
1.  From the main menu, click **Field Service** > **Administration**, and then choose **Characteristics**.  
  
2.  On the **Active Characteristics** screen, click **+New** in the upper left corner.  
  
3.  Use the tooltips to help fill in your information and then click **Save**.
