# View user accounts and security roles (Field Service)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

A user in [!INCLUDE[pn_field_service](../includes/pn-field-service.md)] is a member of your organization who will use a [!INCLUDE[pn_field_service](../includes/pn-field-service.md)] license. Security roles define which entities a user can view as well as how they can interact with those entities. Field security profiles define which fields a user can see. As an example, a user may have permission to see accounts but not to see specific fields for an account. [!INCLUDE[pn_field_service](../includes/pn-field-service.md)] comes with four predefined security roles and field security profiles:  
  
- **Field Service Administrator:** Generally assigned to key people within the organization who need access to the **Administration** tile. Global access to all Field Service entities.  
  
- **Field Service Dispatcher:** Generally people in the organization who are responsible for scheduling and need to manage resources and work orders.  
  
- **Field Service Resource:** Generally people within the organization who will access [!INCLUDE[pn_field_service](../includes/pn-field-service.md)] from a mobile device.  
  
- **Field Service Inventory Purchase:** Generally people within the organization who are responsible for inventory, purchase orders, RMAs, and RTVs.  
  
### To view or enter information for an existing user account  
  
-   Go  to **Microsoft Dynamics 365 > Settings > Security > Users**.  
  
 The following table describes the fields.  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|**Item**|**Description**|  
|**Account Information**|User Name: Validates the user record against [!INCLUDE[pn_Active_Directory](../includes/pn-active-directory.md)]. Users must be created in [!INCLUDE[pn_Active_Directory](../includes/pn-active-directory.md)] before being added to [!INCLUDE[pn_field_service](../includes/pn-field-service.md)].|  
|**User Information**|Enter the user’s name, title, email address, and phone numbers.|  
|**Organization Information**|Enter the user’s site, territory, business unit, and manager. Territory on a user record is a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] entity and will not add the associated resource record to the territory.  You must do this  in the **Resources** section of the **Field Service Administration** tile.|  
|**Mailing Address**|Enter the user’s address. This information can be used by the routing engine and scheduling assistant to calculate travel times and mileage. If the user is going to be a bookable resource, make sure to geocode the address. On the command bar at the top, click **More**, and then click **Geo Code**.|
