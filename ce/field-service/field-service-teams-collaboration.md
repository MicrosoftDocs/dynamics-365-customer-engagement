# Collaborate on work orders with Microsoft Teams

Integrate with Microsoft Teams to chat with team members about work orders. The Teams integration helps find answers and fix issues the first time without leaving the Field Service app. It also lists team members that have previously worked on a work order. Connecting all the associated chats to a work order provides all chats related to that work order in one place.

## Set up the Teams integration

An administrator must set up the overall integration between Microsoft Teams and Dynamics 365 apps. See [Install and set up Teams Integration](/dynamics365/teams-integration/teams-install-app).

## Enable and configure collaboration settings in Field Service

An administrator must enable collaboration in the Field Service settings.

1. In Field Service, go to **Settings** > **Integration** > **Teams Collaboration**. To enable or disable Microsoft Teams chat in other Dynamics 365 apps, see [Work with Microsoft Teams chat in Dynamics 365](/dynamics365/teams-integration/enable-teams-chat).

1. On the **Microsoft Teams collaboration and chat** page, turn on the toggle for **Turn on Microsoft Teams chats inside Dynamics 365**.

1. Select one of the following:

   - **Turn on for all Dynamics 365 apps** – Enables Teams chat for all supported Dynamics 365 apps in your organization, including any that you add in the future.
   - **Turn on for selected Dynamics 365 apps** – Enables Teams chat for the apps you choose. If your organization already uses Teams, the selection you made previously remains. If you haven't yet set up Teams, it's enabled by default.

1. In the **Connect Teams chats to Dynamics 365 records** section, add all the tables you'd like to collaborate on.

1. Save the changes.

## Customize welcome message

When you start a new chat, predefined information creates a welcome message in the chat panel. You can customize the welcome message.

1. In Field Service, go to **Settings** > **Integration** > **Teams Collaboration**.

1. Select the record type, such as Work Order.

1. Select **Message view**, and then select **Save**.

The first five columns in the view you choose appears in the welcome message when you invite someone to collaborate on a record.

## Create a new chat

To [start a new chat](/dynamics365/customer-service/use/use-teams-chat#start-a-new-connected-chat), open a record for a table that is connected to the Teams integration.
