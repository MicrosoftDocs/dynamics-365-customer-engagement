# Get started with Field Service

After you have [installed Dynamics 365 Field Service](install-field-service.md) and have assigned Field Service licenses to your users who need to use the app, you can get started with creating frontline workers and scheduling work orders. The best way to do this is to use the new _Getting Started_ page which can be found in the left navigation pane.

At the top of the page you will see Field Service tours and videos.  Each release we will highlight new features, so it is easy to continuously transform your business by leveraging the best of Dynamics 365 Field Service today and tomorrow. We strongly encourage you to come back to the Get Started page.



In the middle of the page you will see a set of action cards that will guide you through the core Field Service processes, like creating frontline workers (also called technicians), customers, work orders, and finally scheduling work orders to frontline workers. See more details in this article below.

At the bottom of the page you will see links to release notes to stay up to date with the latest improvements, a support community forum to post questions, and an ideas forum to give product feedback.

## Prerequisites

- You must have either System Administrator or Field Service - Administrator privileges to see and use the _Get Started_ page.




## Set up your frontline workers

By the end of this getting started page you will have successfully scheduled a work order to a frontline worker to resolve a customer's issue. 


Start by creating a frontline worker who represents someone in your company who completes work orders. Select the **Set Up** button.

In the form that displays, enter required information. Recommended values are prepopulated and should not be changed unless necessary.

Optionally you can send an email to the frontline worker user to download the mobile app if [mailboxes are set up](frontline-worker-set-up-email-approval.md).

## Create your accounts

Next create an account that represents one of your customers. Select the **Create** button.

Enter basic information into the form.
