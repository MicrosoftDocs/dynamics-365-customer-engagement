2. Find and buy whichever Field Service license works best for you and your organization. Visit the [Field Service pricing page](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/pricing/#FieldService) for more information. And for even more details, visit the [Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide (PDF)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544&clcid=0x409).

4. Purchase Resource Scheduling Optimization. Go to the **Microsoft 365 Admin Center** > **Billing** > **Purchase services**. The price of Resource Scheduling Optimization is based on the number of resources whose schedules are optimized. 

> [!NOTE]
> You are required to purchase as many licenses as the number of bookable resources that are to be optimized. One license provides Resource Scheduling Optimization capability for one bookable resource. The add-on purchase allows unlimited usage of Resource Scheduling Optimization for resources equal to the number of user licenses purchased, be it on a regular cadence or adhoc.

## Next steps

After purchasing Resource Scheduling Optimization, follow the [Resource Scheduling Optimization deployment steps](./rso-deployment.md).
