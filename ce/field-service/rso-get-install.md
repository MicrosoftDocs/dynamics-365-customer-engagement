# Get Resource Scheduling Optimization

In order to purchase access to Resource Scheduling Optimization, you must first have access to Field Service. If you've already acquired your Field Service license through a product bundle, you don't have to repurchase it. If you already have Field Service installed, skip to step 4.

1. Purchase Field Service. Go to the **Microsoft 365 Admin Center** > **Billing > Purchase Services**.
   
2. Find and buy whichever Field Service license works best for you and your organization. Visit the [Field Service pricing page](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/pricing/#FieldService) for more information. And for even more details, visit the [Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide (PDF)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544&clcid=0x409).   

3. After purchasing, install Dynamics 365 Field Service.
   
   - Go to **Admin Centers** > **Dynamics 365** > **Instances**.
   - Select your instance and choose **Solutions**.
   - Select Field Service and choose **Install**.

4. Purchase Resource Scheduling Optimization. Go to the **Microsoft 365 Admin Center** > **Billing** > **Purchase services**. The price of Resource Scheduling Optimization is based on the number of resources whose schedules are optimized. 

> [!NOTE]
> You are required to purchase as many licenses as the number of bookable resources that are to be optimized. One license provides Resource Scheduling Optimization capability for one bookable resource. The add-on purchase allows unlimited usage of Resource Scheduling Optimization for resources equal to the number of user licenses purchased, be it on a regular cadence or an ad-hoc basis. 

## Next steps

After purchasing Resource Scheduling Optimization, follow the [Resource Scheduling Optimization deployment steps](./rso-deployment.md). 
Note that Resource Scheduling Optimization isn't visible from the main product catalog. It can be found only on the Field Service product details page, via the **Add On** tab.
