# Track how an order is shipped with Ship Via (Field Service)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

When you create a [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_field_service](../includes/pn-dyn-365-field-service.md)] purchase order in the system, it's a good idea  to track how the order is shipped. This helps you track the purchase order. The ship-via option lets you specify different shipping methods used by your company.  
  
 For example, you might use freight shipping, USPS Ground, or FedEx when products are purchased. In this case, you can specify these shipping methods in the ship-via setting. When you create ship-via methods, you'll see this in the purchase order form.  
  
1.  From the main menu, click **Field Service** > **Administration**, and then choose **Ship Via**.  
  
2.  On the **Active Ship Via** screen, click **+New** in the upper left corner.  
  
3.  Use the tooltips to help you fill in your information, and then click **Save**.
