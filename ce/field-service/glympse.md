# Use the Glympse solution to track the location of a technician

Share your technicianâ€™s location with your customers with Integration with Glympse for [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)]. Glympse works with [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_field_service](../includes/pn-dyn-365-field-service.md)] and offers integration with Glympse services that allow you to track the location of technicians as they travel to customer sites. This is done by sharing a real-time map that continuously updates estimated time of arrival.
