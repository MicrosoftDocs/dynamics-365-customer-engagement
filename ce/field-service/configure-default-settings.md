# Configure default settings for work orders, bookings, schedule board, and agreements (Field Service)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

 Set default settings for work orders, bookings, schedule board settings, agreements, and more in [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-field_service](../includes/pn-dyn-365-field-service.md)].  
  
 For example, in the **Other** section, you may want to set **Auto Geo Code Addresses** to **Yes**. This will automatically geocode addresses.  
  
### To set default settings  
  
1.  From the main menu, click **Field Service** > **Administration**, and then choose **Field Service Settings**.  
  
2.  Fill in the information, as required.  Click a tab to see information on settings.  
  
3.  When youâ€™re done, click **Save**.
