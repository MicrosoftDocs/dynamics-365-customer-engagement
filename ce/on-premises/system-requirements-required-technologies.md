# Microsoft Dynamics 365 system requirements and required technologies

[!INCLUDE [cc_applies_to_on-prem-9_0_0](../includes/cc_applies_to_on-prem-9_0_0.md)]

This [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_op_edition](../includes/pn-crm-op-edition.md)] version requires the following software:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Windows_Server_long](../includes/pn-ms-windows-server-long.md)]  
  
-   A [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Windows_Server_long](../includes/pn-ms-windows-server-long.md)][!INCLUDE[pn_Active_Directory](../includes/pn-active-directory.md)] infrastructure  
  
-   An [!INCLUDE[pn_Internet_Information_Services](../includes/pn-internet-information-services.md)] website  
  
-   Claims-based security token service (required for Internet-facing deployments)  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_SQL_Server](../includes/pn-ms-sql-server.md)]  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_Reporting](../includes/pn-sql-server-reporting.md)]  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange_Server_full](../includes/pn-exchange-server-full.md)] or access to a POP3-compliant email server (required for email tracking)  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_Server_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-server-short.md)] (required for document management)  
  
-   Supported device, [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] app, or web browser, such as later versions of [!INCLUDE[pn_Internet_Explorer](../includes/pn-internet-explorer.md)] or the latest versions of [!INCLUDE[tn_Apple_Safari](../includes/tn-apple-safari.md)], [!INCLUDE[tn_Google_Chrome](../includes/tn-google-chrome.md)], and [!INCLUDE[tn_Mozilla_Firefox](../includes/tn-mozilla-firefox.md)]  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Office](../includes/pn-ms-office.md)] for [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_full](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-full.md)] and other [!INCLUDE[pn_office_shortest](../includes/pn-office-shortest.md)] integration features  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  For detailed hardware and software requirements or specific product versions and service pack levels that are supported, see the topics in this section.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Typically, [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] applications support the latest version and service pack (SP) for all required components, such as [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Server](../includes/pn-windows-server.md)], [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_SQL_Server](../includes/pn-ms-sql-server.md)], and [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Office](../includes/pn-ms-office.md)]. However, to fully support the latest version of a required component, you should apply the latest update for [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].  
>   
>  The optional and dependent products listed here that have reached their mainstream support end date might only receive full support with the [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] application. Updates may not be made available if Microsoft determines the issue is caused by the expired product. For more information about product lifecycles, see [Select a Product for Lifecycle Information](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=248439).  
  
 Before you install [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)], review the topics in this section, which provide detailed information about the products and technologies that are required or optional and supported configurations.
