# How to discover the URL for your organization using the Discovery Service 

Use the Discovery service to determine the organizations that a user is a member of, and the endpoint address URL to access the organization service for each of those organizations. This Discovery service is necessary because Dynamics 365 Server is a multi-tenant environment—a single Dynamics 365 Server can host multiple business organizations. By using the Discovery service, your application can determine the endpoint address URL to access the target organization’s business data.  
  
 For Dynamics 365 Server installations, server and organization allocation may change as part of datacenter management and load balancing. Therefore, the Discovery service provides a way to discover which Dynamics 365 Server is serving your organization at a given time.  
  
 For an Internet-facing deployment (IFD) installation, the Web service URL has the following form:  
```  
https://dev.<hostname[:port]>/XRMServices/2011/Discovery.svc  
```  

 For an on-premises installation, the web service URL has the following form:  
```  
http[s]://<hostname[:port]>/XRMServices/2011/Discovery.svc  
```  

 Consult the **Developer Resources** page in the Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) Web application for the correct URL of your installation.  
  
 To use the Discovery service, add a reference to the `Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.dll` assembly to your [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio](../includes/pn-visual-studio.md)] project, and then add a `using` or `imports` statement to access the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Discovery> namespace. The <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Discovery.IDiscoveryService> interface provides <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Discovery.IDiscoveryService.Execute*> method you will use to pass a instance of the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Discovery.DiscoveryRequest> class.
 
Alternatively, you can add the service references for the URLs described previously to your project.
