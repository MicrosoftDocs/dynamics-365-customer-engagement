# Extend Dynamics 365 for Outlook

[!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_dynamics_crm_for_outlook](../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-for-outlook.md)] lets users interact with data while they’re offline and not connected to a server. Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) includes features that let you extend your solutions to offline scenarios by calling the web services offline from your custom code. In addition, the <xref:Microsoft.Crm.Outlook.Sdk> assembly provides programmatic support for basic [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Outlook_Short](../includes/pn-ms-outlook-short.md)] actions such as synchronization, going offline or online, and [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] state verification. Offline programming uses the [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_asp_net_development_server](../includes/pn-ms-asp-net-development-server.md)].  
  
 Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) include features that allow administrators to customize and manage filters for their users. Filter templates provide the starting point for entity synchronization on [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)]. Filters determine which entity collections are synchronized to [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] and to [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_SQL_Express](../includes/pn-ms-sql-express.md)] for offline-enabled Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) solution.
