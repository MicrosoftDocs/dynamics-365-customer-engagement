# Schedule and appointment entities

[!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] provides capabilities to address appointment-based service scheduling. You can define services, resources and work schedules, and service locations. A scheduling engine manages booked appointments and service availability, and can be tuned to optimize scheduling to reduce costs and required resources.  
  
 The entity model for the scheduling engine includes a core set of entities: `Service`, `Resource`, `Calendar` and `Site`. Other entities describe resource requirements, constraints, calendar rules, and a schedule.  
  
 The following messages can be used for scheduling appointments, recurring appointments, and service appointments (service activity).  
  
|Message|Web API Operation|SDK Assembly|  
|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|  
|Creates an appointment, recurring appointment, or service appointment (service activity), and calls the scheduling engine to make sure that it is valid for all constraints without any scheduling conflicts.|<xref href="Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.Book?text=Book Action" />|<xref:Microsoft.Crm.Sdk.Messages.BookRequest>|  
|Reschedules an appointment, recurring appointment, or service appointment (service activity), and calls the scheduling engine to make sure that it is valid for all constraints without any scheduling conflicts.|<xref href="Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.Reschedule?text=Reschedule Action" />|<xref:Microsoft.Crm.Sdk.Messages.RescheduleRequest>|
