# Sample: Retrieve the roles for an organization

This sample shows how to retrieve the roles for an organization by using the [IOrganizationService.RetrieveMultiple](/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.iorganizationservice.retrievemultiple?view=dynamics-general-ce-9&preserve-view=true) method.

You can download the sample from [here](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/dataverse/orgsvc/CSharp/RetrieveRolesForOrganization).

## How to run this sample

[!include[cc-how-to-run-samples](includes/cc-how-to-run-PA-samples.md)]

## What this sample does

The [IOrganizationService.RetrieveMultiple](/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.iorganizationservice.retrievemultiple?view=dynamics-general-ce-9&preserve-view=true) message is intended to be used in a scenario where it contains data that is needed to retrieve a collection of records.

## How this sample works

In order to simulate the scenario described in [What this sample does](#what-this-sample-does), the sample will do the following:

### Setup

Checks for the current version of the org.

### Demonstrate

The `query` method retrieves all the roles that are present in an organization.

### Clean up

This sample creates no records. No cleanup is required.
