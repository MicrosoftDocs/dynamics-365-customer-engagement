# Discover the URL for your organization using the Discovery Service 

Use the discovery service to determine the organizations that a user is a member of, and the endpoint address URL to access the organization service for each of those organizations. This discovery service is necessary because [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] is a multi-tenant environment—a single [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] server can host multiple business organizations. By using the discovery service, your application can determine the endpoint address URL to access the target organization’s business data.  
  
 For [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)] installations, server and organization allocation may change as part of datacenter management and load balancing. Therefore, the discovery service provides a way to discover which [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] server is serving your organization at a given time.  
  
 For an Internet-facing deployment (IFD) installation, the Web service URL has the following form:  
```  
https://dev.<hostname[:port]>/XRMServices/2011/Discovery.svc  
```  

 For an on-premises installation, the web service URL has the following form:  
```  
http[s]://<hostname[:port]>/XRMServices/2011/Discovery.svc  
```  

 Consult the **Developer Resources** page in the [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] Web application for the correct URL of your installation.  
  
 To use the discovery service, add a reference to the `Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.dll` assembly to your [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio](../../includes/pn-visual-studio.md)] project, and then add a `using` or `imports` statement to access the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Discovery> namespace. The <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Discovery.IDiscoveryService> interface provides <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Discovery.IDiscoveryService.Execute*> method you will use to pass a instance of the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Discovery.DiscoveryRequest> class.
 
Alternatively, you can add the service references for the URLs described previously to your project.
