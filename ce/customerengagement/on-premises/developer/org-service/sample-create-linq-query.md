# Sample: Create a LINQ query

Download the complete sample from [Sample: Query data using LINQ](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/dataverse/orgsvc/CSharp/QueriesUsingLINQ).

[!INCLUDE[cc-sample-note](../includes/cc-sample-note.md)]

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE[sdk-prerequisite](../../includes/sdk-prerequisite.md)]

## Requirements

[!INCLUDE[cc-how-to-run-PA-samples](../includes/cc-how-to-run-PA-samples.md)]

## Demonstrates

This sample shows how to create simple [!INCLUDE[pn_LINQ](../../includes/pn-linq.md)] queries. The following queries are demonstrated:

- Retrieve all accounts that the calling user has access to.

- Retrieve all accounts owned by the user who has read access rights to the accounts and where the last name of the user is not “Cannon.”

- Return a count of all accounts that have a county specified in their addresses.

- Return a count of states in which we have an account. This uses the `distinct` keyword that counts a state only once.

- Return contacts where the city equals “Redmond” AND the first name is “Joe” OR “John.”

## Example
