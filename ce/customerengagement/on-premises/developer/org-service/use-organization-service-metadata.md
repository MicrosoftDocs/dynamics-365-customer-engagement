# Use the Organization service with Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement metadata

Metadata refers to the structure of entities used to manage data in [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)]. Virtually all tasks to manage metadata can be performed by using the customization tools in the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. This section describes how to programmatically access and modify the metadata model.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Adding, removing or changing entities, alternate keys, attributes, or relationships can interfere with normal system operation. If you’re applying changes to a production system we recommend that you schedule these operations when it’s least disruptive to users.
