# Site entity

The *site* entity represents a location or branch office where an organization does business. Many [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] customers have multiple sites. Sites enable resources, services, and appointments to be defined at a particular location with an associated time zone. Location, correct selection of resources, and time zone are important elements in the scheduling of service appointments when multiple locations of doing business are involved. You can use sites to limit what resources, such as users and equipment, can be scheduled for a specific service activity.  
  
 When you search for an available service activity resource calendar time slot, to avoid making an appointment in the wrong location, the scheduler must be able to select the site or delivery location as a constraint to the search. For example, a customer may ask for an appointment at the Seattle office. To support this, there must be a site named Seattle and there must be required resources assigned to the service type to be performed. When generating appointment proposals, [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] must be able to avoid proposing appointments with resources that canâ€™t physically be together to provide the service. The site entity serves this purpose. Sites provide for the grouping of resources, such as users and facility/equipment, services, and appointments, according to a location with an associated time zone and locale.
