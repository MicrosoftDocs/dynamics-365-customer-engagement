# Integrate Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) with SharePoint

[!INCLUDE[pn_ms_sharepoint_server](../includes/pn-ms-sharepoint-server.md)] is a collaboration and content management application that simplifies how people store, find, and share information. It helps people to collaborate effectively by having secure access to documents and information that they require to make business decisions.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration feature enables you to store and manage documents on [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] in the context of a Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) record, and use the [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] document management abilities in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises), such as checking the document in and out, viewing version history, and changing document properties.  
  
 Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) support two types of integration with [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)]: client-to-server and server-to-server (server-based). [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Enable SharePoint integration](integration-dev/get-started-sharepoint-integration.md#SPIntegration)  
  
 Use the `SharePointSite` and `SharePointDocumentLocation` entities to store and manage the [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_Server_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-server-short.md)] location records in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], and the `UserMapping` entity to define custom claim mappings to use a value other than the default value used by [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] to authenticate and authorize [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] user in [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)].
