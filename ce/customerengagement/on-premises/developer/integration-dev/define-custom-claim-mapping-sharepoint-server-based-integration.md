# Define custom claim mapping for SharePoint server-based integration

For server-based integration with [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)], [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]  uses claims to authenticate and authorize [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] users to access the documents stored in [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)]. For more information about claims-based authentication, see [Claims-based identity in SharePoint 2013](/sharepoint/dev/general-development/claims-based-identity-in-sharepoint).  

 By default, [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] uses the following claims  to integrate with [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)]:

 You can use the `UserMapping` entity to specify custom claim mappings in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] to use a value other than the default value used by [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] to authenticate and authorize [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] users in [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)]. For example, you can use the “last name” and “first name” of the user instead of “email” to authenticate [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] users in [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)]. Custom claim mappings override the default claim mappings used by [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. You can define multiple custom claim mappings in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. By default, only users having the System Administrator role have access to the `UserMapping` entity.  

 To define a custom claim mapping in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], create a `UserMapping` entity record, and specify the attribute values listed in the following table.  


|               Attribute               |                                                                     Value                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

In the current release, only `0` ([!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)]) is supported.                                                                                                                                                                                      |

For example, if you want to use the first name of the user as the attribute for custom claim mapping and a user’s first name is missing, [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] will use the default claim mapping (PUID or email). |
|        `UserMapping.ClaimType`        |                                                                  String value                                                                  |                     Specify the claim type to be sent to SharePoint. For a list of claim types, see [ClaimTypes Members](/previous-versions/windows-identity-foundation/ee727097(v=msdn.10)). **Note:**  The referred claim type list is just for reference. All the claim types listed there might not be supported by [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)], or might not contain all the claim types supported by [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)].                      |

 The following sample code shows how to define a custom claim mapping using the `UserMapping` entity.  

```csharp
UserMapping customMapping = new UserMapping  
{  
   PartnerApplicationType = new OptionSetValue(0),  
   SystemUserAttributeName = "personalemailaddress",  
   ClaimType = "smtp"  
};  
_serviceProxy.Create(customMapping);  
```  

> [!NOTE]
>  Any instance of the `UserMapping` entity with valid values will override the default claim mappings used by [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)].  

 By default, [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] supports the following claim types: NameId (PUID), SMTP (email), and UPN (user principal name). If you’re passing a claim of any other type, you must also create corresponding claim type mappings in [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)].
