# BusinessUnit entity

An organization in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)], such as a holding company or a corporation, is made up of business units. A *business unit* is a unit of the top-level organization. Business units can be parents of other business units (child business units). The first business unit created for an organization is called the root business unit. Business units can be deleted, however, the root business unit canâ€™t be deleted.  
  
 A *parent business unit* is any business unit with one or more business units that report to it in the hierarchy.  
  
 A *child business unit* is a business unit that is immediately under another business unit in the business hierarchy of an organization.  
  
 A business unit can own records as defined in the ownership type in the metadata definition for an entity. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Entity Ownership](introduction-entities.md#EntityOwnership)  
  
 You can call the <xref:Microsoft.Crm.Sdk.Messages.WhoAmIRequest> message to find out the business unit for the currently logged on or impersonated user.
