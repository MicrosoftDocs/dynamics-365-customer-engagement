# Sample: How to determine whether a user has a role

This sample code is for [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)]. Download the complete sample from [Work with Users and Roles](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365-Apps-Samples/tree/master/samples-from-msdn/UsersAndRoles).  

## Prerequisites
[!INCLUDE[sdk-prerequisite](../includes/sdk-prerequisite.md)]
  
## Requirements  
[!INCLUDE[sdk_SeeConnectionHelper](../includes/sdk-seeconnectionhelper.md)]
  
## Demonstrates  
 This sample shows how to determine whether a user in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] has been associated with a specific role. This is performed by using a query with the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.RetrieveMultiple*> method. A snippet that shows the key sections of the sample is shown first, followed by the [complete sample code](sample-create-on-premises-user.md#complete_sample). Note that this sample can only be run in an on-premises environment because it creates a user. However, the section of the sample that demonstrates retrieving the roles for a user will work for all environments.
