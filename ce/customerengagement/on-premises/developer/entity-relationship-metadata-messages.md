# Entity relationship metadata messages

Entity relationships define how entities are related to each other. This includes information about how relationships are represented in the application. Also, when actions are performed on a record, the relationship indicates what actions to perform on related records.  
  
## Entity relationship messages  
 The following table lists the messages that you can use to create, retrieve, update, and delete entity relationships.
