[!include[cc-sample-note](includes/cc-sample-note.md)]

## How to run this sample

[!include[cc-how-to-run-samples](includes/cc-how-to-run-PA-samples.md)]

## What this sample does

The `CreateRequiredRecords` method creates the sample data that is required for the sample. The `retrievedFax` method retrieves the fax. 
The `DeleteRequiredRecords` method gives an option to delete all the data that sample has created.

## How this sample works

In order to simulate the scenario described in [What this sample does](#what-this-sample-does), the sample will do the following:

### Setup

1. Checks for the current version of the org.
1. The `WhoAmIRequest` method gets the current user details.
1. The `ActivityParty` method creates the activity party for sending and receiving fax.
1. The `Fax` method creates the fax required for the sample.

### Demonstrate

1. Retrieves all the fax id's that are created in [Setup](#setup).
2. Creates a task and verifies whether the task has been created.

### Clean up

Displays an option to delete all the data created in the sample. The deletion is optional in case you want to examine the data created by the sample. You can manually delete the data to achieve same results.
