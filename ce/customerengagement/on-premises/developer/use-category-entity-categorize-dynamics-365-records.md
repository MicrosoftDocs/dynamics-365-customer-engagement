# Use the Category entity to categorize Customer Engagement (on-premises) records

Categorizing entity records helps you tag the records so that you can easily search them. Use the `Category` entity to create and manage a hierarchical structure of categories in Customer Engagement (on-premises), and then associate entity records to one or more categories.

 A category can have multiple child categories, but a child category can have only one parent category. Deleting a parent `Category` record automatically deletes all its child records and entity associations. You define a parent category for a category using the `Category.ParentCategoryId` attribute.  
  
 Use the `Category.SequenceNumber` attribute to programmatically define the display order for categories in the hierarchy.  When you a add a new category using the web client, it is automatically added after the last category in the hierarchy. You can also use the `Category.CategoryNumber` attribute to programmatically set or update a number for category to help you easily distinguish a group of categories. Category number can be set to any value programmatically, but is automatically set when you create a category using the web client based on the auto-numbering prefix specified by the administrator for categories in the web client (**Settings** > **Administration** > **Auto-Numbering** > **Categories** tab).  
  
 You can associate `Category` records with system and custom entity records by using relationships and connections. A category record can be associated with different entity records. For example, you can programmatically associate a `Category` record with an `Account`, `Contact` and `Incident` records.  
  
 By default, there is a many-to-many relationship available between the `Category` and `KnowledgeArticle` entity, and the entity record associations are stored in the `KnowledgeArticlesCategories` entity.
