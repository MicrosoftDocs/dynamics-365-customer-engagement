# Client scripting in Customer Engagement using JavaScript

Client-side scripting using JavaScript is one of the ways to apply custom business process logic for displaying data on a form in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises). Forms in Customer Engagement (on-premises) help display data to the user. A form in a Customer Engagement (on-premises) org can contain items such as fields, a quick form, or a grid.

You can also use business rules, which provides a way for someone, who does not know JavaScript and is not a developer, to apply business process logic in a form. More information: [Create business rules and recommendations to apply logic in a form](../../customize/create-business-rules-recommendations-apply-logic-form.md)

Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) provide you a rich set of **client APIs** to interact with form objects and events to control what and when to display on a form.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The client-side scripting concepts in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) are similar to what is applicable in the [model-driven apps](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-overview) in Power Apps. Refer to to the client API docs in the model-driven apps section of the Power Apps documentation here: [Apply business logic using client scripting in model-driven apps using JavaScript](/powerapps/developer/model-driven-apps/client-scripting)
  
Some client APIs are deprecated in the current release of Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises). Ensure that you are aware of these APIs as you write your client-side code for Customer Engagement. More information: [Deprecated client APIs](/dynamics365/get-started/whats-new/customer-engagement/important-changes-coming#some-client-apis-are-deprecated)
