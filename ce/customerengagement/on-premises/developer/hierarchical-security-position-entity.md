# Hierarchical security (position) entity

In [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)], hierarchy security enables you to model the manager/direct report structure that is often used in businesses. The *Position* entity provides the capability to model this type of relationship. A system user in a higher level position can access the business data being accessed by another user in a lower level position.
