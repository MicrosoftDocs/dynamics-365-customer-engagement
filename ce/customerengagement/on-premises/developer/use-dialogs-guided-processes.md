# Use dialogs for guided processes

Dialogs are the synchronous or interactive processes in [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)] that collect and process information by using step-by-step scripts to direct users through a process. For example, you can create dialogs to act as a guide for your service representatives for case resolution and case escalation. Similarly, you can create dialogs for standardizing sales processes such as opportunity qualification and lead scoring.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [Dialogs are deprecated](/dynamics365/get-started/whats-new/customer-engagement/important-changes-coming#dialogs-are-deprecated), and should be replaced by business process flows or canvas apps in Power Apps. More information: [Replace dialogs with business process flows or canvas apps](/flow/replace-dialogs).
  
 Every time that you run a dialog in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], a `ProcessSession` record is created. The process session stores the session log about the dialog process that was run.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Due to the interactive nature of the dialog process, you can’t run a dialog using the [!INCLUDE[cc-dyn365-ce-web-services](../includes/cc-dyn365-ce-web-services.md)]. A dialog can only be run through the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] web application. Dialogs aren’t supported in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)].
