# Actions on dialogs

This topic describes the actions you can perform on dialogs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [Dialogs are deprecated](/dynamics365/get-started/whats-new/customer-engagement/important-changes-coming#dialogs-are-deprecated), and should be replaced by business process flows or canvas apps in Power Apps. More information: [Replace dialogs with business process flows or canvas apps](/flow/replace-dialogs).

## Dialog-related activities

 These activities are available as steps in the Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) Process Designer.  

### Query Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) Data

 Enables you to define query variables that can be used to query Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) data. 
These query variables can either have pre-defined values or can be parameterized so that they accept values at the runtime, 
and fetch records accordingly.  

 You can parameterize a query variable by using the **Modify Query Variables** tab on the **Define Query** page, 
and then use the dynamic values section on the query form to associate the prompt and response variables with the query variables.  

 The query variable defined using the **Query Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) Data** step is available for all the prompts and responses from the point where they 
have been defined in the dialog definition.  

### Assign Value

 Enables you to perform simple arithmetic (increment, decrement, and multiply) and string (append) operations on the variables and input arguments 
in dialogs. You can also use the **Assign Value** step to clear any value that is stored in the variables or input parameters.  

### Link Child Dialog

 You can specify a dialog as a child dialog, and invoke it from within another dialog (parent) by using the **Link Child Dialog** step in the parent 
dialog.  

### Stop Dialog

 Enables you to end a dialog at a particular stage in the dialog flow. This step can be used in any conditional statement where you want a dialog to 
end at that point based on the response from the user.

## Workflow-related activities

 The following workflow-related activities can be used for dialogs: **Create Record**, **Update Record**, **Assign Record**, **Update Record**, 
**Send E-mail**, **Start Child Workflow**, and **Change Status**.

## Custom workflow activities

 You can create custom workflow activities to extend the dialogs in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises). For detailed 
information about custom workflow activities, see [Custom Workflow Activities](custom-workflow-activities-workflow-assemblies.md).  

<a name="StartDialog"></a>   

## Start a dialog by using a URL

 You can start an activated dialog by specifying the URL of the dialog. To do so, you must specify the URL in the following format:  

```
https://CRMServer_Name/Org_Name/cs/dialog/rundialog.aspx?DialogId=DialogID&EntityName=EntityLogicalName&ObjectId=EntityObjectId  
```

 Where,  

- *CRMServer_Name* is the name of your Dynamics 365 Server.  

- _Org_Name_ is the organization name.  

- _DialogID_ is GUID of the dialog that you want to run.  

- _EntityLogicalName_ is the entity logical name of the primary entity of the dialog that you want to run.  

- _EntityObjectId_ is the GUID of the primary entity record.  
  A sample URL to start a dialog:  
  `https://crmserver/AdventureWorksCycle/cs/dialog/rundialog.aspx?DialogId=9F53D2D8-AC54-46A6-A190-F23DE6677C65&EntityName=contact&ObjectId=aaaaaaaa-0000-1111-2222-bbbbbbbbbbbb`
