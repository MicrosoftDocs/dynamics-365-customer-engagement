# Customize Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement applications

[!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] client applications include the web application, [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Dynamics_CRM_Mobile](../../includes/pn-dyn-365-phones.md)], and [!INCLUDE[pn_moca_full](../../includes/pn-moca-full.md)]. Each of these clients reference a common set of data that controls visual elements of the clients. This *application metadata* is usually edited using customization tools in the application or third-party tools. Other clients can also reference this application metadata if they want to leverage configuration options defined for specific organizations.  
  
 For an in-depth guide to customization by using the tools available in the web application see [Getting started with customization](../../customize/getting-started-customization.md). The topics in this section describe the structure of the data edited by those tools or third-party tools.
