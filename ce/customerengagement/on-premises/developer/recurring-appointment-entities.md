# Recurring appointment entities

Recurring appointments occur more than once, and follow an occurrence pattern. For example, you can set up an appointment to discuss a project status that occurs every week on Friday. Recurring appointments provide the ability to add recurrence information (occurrence pattern) to a new or an existing appointment in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].
