 This sample shows how to associate a role with a user by using the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.Associate*> method. A snippet showing just the key portions of the sample is shown first, followed by the [Complete Sample Code](sample-create-on-premises-user.md#complete_sample).
