# Sample: How to disable a user

This sample code is for [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)]. Download the complete sample from [Sample: Work with Users and Roles](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365-Apps-Samples/tree/master/samples-from-msdn/UsersAndRoles).   
  
## Requirements  
[!INCLUDE[sdk_SeeConnectionHelper](../includes/sdk-seeconnectionhelper.md)]
  
## Demonstrates  
 This sample shows how to create a user in an [!INCLUDE[pn_Active_Directory](../includes/pn-active-directory.md)] environment using the <xref:Microsoft.Crm.Sdk.Messages.SetStateRequest> message. A snippet showing just the key sections of the sample is shown first, followed by the [complete sample code](sample-create-on-premises-user.md#complete_sample). Note that this sample can only be run in an on-premises environment because it creates a user. However, the portion of the sample that demonstrates disabling the user will work for all environments.
