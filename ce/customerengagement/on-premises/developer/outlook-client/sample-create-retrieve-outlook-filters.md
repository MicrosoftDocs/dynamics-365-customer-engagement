# Sample: Create and retrieve Outlook filters

[!include[cc-sample-note](../includes/cc-sample-note.md)]

## How to run this sample

[!include[cc-how-to-run-samples](../includes/cc-how-to-run-PA-samples.md)]

## How this sample works

In order to simulate the scenario described above, the sample will do the following:

### Setup

Checks for the current version of the org.

### Demonstrate

1. The `fetchXml` method creates asn retrieves offline filter. In your Outlook client, this will appear in System Filters tab under **File -> CRM -> Synchronize -> Outlook Filters**.
2. The `InstantiateFiltersRequest` method activates the selected offline templates for the current user.
3. The `ResetUserFilterRequest` method resets the current user's offline templates to the defaults.

### Clean up

Display an option to delete the sample data that is created in [Setup](#setup). The deletion is optional in case you want to examine the entities and data created by the sample. You can manually delete the records to achieve the same result.
