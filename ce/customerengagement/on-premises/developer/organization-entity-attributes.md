# Organization entity attributes

The following information is for the organization entity in a default, uncustomized installation of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]. The schema name and early bound class for this entity is `Organization`. The Web API uses [Organization Entity](entities/organization.md).  

 The values set for these attributes control behaviors for the organization. They are usually set via the organization settings page in the application.  

> [!NOTE]
>  These attributes may refer to planned capabilities for future versions, deprecated capabilities, or capabilities not available for your deployment type. Don’t experiment by changing these values programmatically unless you understand how they apply to your organization.
