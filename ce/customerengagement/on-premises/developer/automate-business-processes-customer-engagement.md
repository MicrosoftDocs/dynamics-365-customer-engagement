# Automate your business processes in Customer Engagement (on-premises)

Business processes are an integral part of any enterprise software application. A business process can be of two types: *automated* processes that rely solely on 
communication among applications based on a set of rules, and *interactive* processes that also rely on people to initiate and run the process, and to make the 
appropriate decisions during the running of the process.  
<!-- TODO: Do you really mean online here?-->  
 In Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises), a process enables you to create and manage your automated and 
interactive business processes. While the name has been changed from workflow to *process*, the entity thatâ€™s used to implement a process is still called 
*workflow*. A Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) process provides many out-of-the-box components that business users and administrators 
can use to model their business processes. Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) also offers developers a mechanism to extend and customize 
the standard behavior of processes to achieve the functionality that their business applications require by allowing them to develop custom components.  
  
 A Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) process is based on the 
[Windows Workflow Foundation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/aa663328.aspx) programming model. 
[!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Workflow_Foundation](../includes/pn-windows-workflow-foundation.md)] provides a runtime engine, a framework, a base library of activities, 
and default implementations of the runtime services. The [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Workflow_Foundation](../includes/pn-windows-workflow-foundation.md)] runtime engine 
manages process execution, and supports processes that can remain active for extended periods of time. It preserves the state of process execution during computer 
shutdown and restart.
