# Model your business data

Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) provides a robust and customizable data model that uses entities to define the data tracked in the system. This section describes the out-of-the-box entities that correspond to the areas shown in the web application. These entities are defined by metadata. For more information about how to customize entities, see [The Metadata and Data Models in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises)](metadata-data-models.md).
