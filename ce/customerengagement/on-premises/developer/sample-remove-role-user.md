# Sample: Remove a role for a user

This sample code is for [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)]. Download the complete sample from [Sample: Work with Users and Roles](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365-Apps-Samples/tree/master/samples-from-msdn/UsersAndRoles).

## Demonstrates  
 This sample shows how to disassociate a role from a user by using the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.Disassociate*> method. A snippet showing just the key sections of the sample is shown first, followed by the [complete sample code](sample-create-on-premises-user.md#complete_sample). Note that this sample can only be run in an on-premises environment because it creates a user. However, the section of the sample that demonstrates disassociating a role from a user will work for all environments.
