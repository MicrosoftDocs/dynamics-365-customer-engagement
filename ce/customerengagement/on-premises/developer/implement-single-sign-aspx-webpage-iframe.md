# Implement single sign-on from an ASPX webpage or IFRAME

This topic describes how to develop a custom webpage that can make SDK calls to Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) on behalf of the Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) user who is signed in. The typical use of this capability is to write a webpage that is displayed in an inline frame in the Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) web application user interface. That webpage performs its intended operation, for example, providing a store front, while being hosted on a website independent of the site that’s hosting [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. However, the webpage can perform its operations on behalf of the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] user who is signed in. The result is seamless integration between a webpage and Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises).  
  
## Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) with a separate website  
 This scenario is for a Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) Internet-facing deployment (IFD) where a separate website hosts a custom ASPX webpage that is optionally displayed in an inline frame of the Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) web application. This scenario uses federated claims. Therefore, you’ll have to set up a security token service (STS) server for identity management. You’ll also need a certificate to be used when making Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) and the website relying parties, which established cross-domain trust between these parties.  
  
### Background information  
 For more information about how to configure claims and a relying party, see the following topics in [Deploying and administering Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises)](/previous-versions/dynamicscrm-2016/deployment-administrators-guide/hh699811(v=crm.8)):

## Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) with an Azure-hosted webpage  
 This scenario is for use with Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) where [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Azure](../includes/pn-windows-azure.md)] hosts a custom webpage that’s optionally displayed in an inline frame of the Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) web application. This scenario uses federated claims, provided by the [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Live](../includes/pn-windows-live.md)] security token service (STS) server for identity management. You must provide a certificate to be used when making Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) and the [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Azure](../includes/pn-windows-azure.md)] website relying parties, which established cross-domain trust between these parties.  
  
### Background information  
 For more information about how to configure a relying party, see the following topic: [Secure Azure Web Role ASP.NET Web Application Using Access Control Service v2.0](/archive/technet-wiki/2590.secure-azure-web-role-asp-net-web-application-using-access-control-service-v2-0)

## Enable inline frame communication across domains  
 If you want to enable communication for an inline frame (iframe) that contains content from a different domain, you can use the `Window.postMessage` method. This browser method can be used for [!INCLUDE[pn_IE_8](../includes/pn-ie-8.md)]. [!INCLUDE[tn_Google_Chrome](../includes/tn-google-chrome.md)], [!INCLUDE[tn_Mozilla_Firefox](../includes/tn-mozilla-firefox.md)], and [!INCLUDE[tn_Apple_Safari](../includes/tn-apple-safari.md)] also support this method. For more information about using `postMessage`, see the following blog posts:
