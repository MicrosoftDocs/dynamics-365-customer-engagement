# Uninstall or delete a solution

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-on-premises](../includes/applies-to-on-premises.md)] [Uninstall or delete a solution](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/uninstall-delete-solution).

You delete managed and unmanaged solutions in the same way, but the resulting actions are very different. Deleting a managed solution will uninstall the managed solution.  
  
<a name="BKMK_DeleteSolution"></a>   
## Delete a solution  
 Depending on the type of solution that you want to delete, you'll see one of the following **Confirm Deletion** messages:  
  
 **Managed solution**  
 "You are deleting a managed solution. The solution and all its components will be deleted. This action cannot be undone. This solution might take several minutes to uninstall. You cannot cancel the uninstallation after it starts. Do you want to continue?"  
  
 **Unmanaged solution**  
 "You are deleting an unmanaged solution. The solution will be deleted but components that are contained in this solution will not be deleted. This action cannot be undone. Do you want to continue?"  
  
 To delete a solution programmatically use the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.Delete*> method. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Delete a Solution](work-solutions.md#BKMK_DeleteSolution)

### Uninstall a managed solution  
 Deleting a managed solution will uninstall the solution. All the solution components defined in it are deleted.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  When you uninstall a managed solution, the following data is lost: data stored in custom entities that are part of the solution and data stored in custom attributes on system entities that are part of the solution.  
  
<a name="BKMK_DeleteUnmanagedSolution"></a>   
### Delete an unmanaged solution  
 An unmanaged solution is a group of solution components. Deleting the solution deletes a single solution record in the database. Solution components are not affected by the solution being deleted, they remain in the system.

## Access the solutions list with a URL  
 If you need to navigate directly to the solutions list you can use the following URL:  
  
```
<organization root url>/tools/Solution/home_solution.aspx?etn=solution  
```
