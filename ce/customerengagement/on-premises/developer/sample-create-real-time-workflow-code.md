description: "The sample shows you how to create a real-time workflow in code instead of using the interactive workflow designer in the web application. This sample works only with an on-premises or an Internet-facing deployment (IFD) of Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement because custom XAML workflows aren’t supported in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises).
