# Prepare source files for import

Before you can import data into [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)], you must create the source data files.  
  
The data source files that you use in an import must be formatted as comma-separated values (.csv), XML Spreadsheet 2003 (.xml), or text files. The use of source files enables the transfer of data from database systems that use different formats into [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].  
  
A source file may contain data for one entity type or multiple entity types, such as accounts and contacts. For the source files that contain multiple entity data, you must provide a map that includes the `<EntitiesPerFile>` tag. Set the value of this tag to “Multiple” to indicate that there is more than one entity type in the source file. Add the `Dedupe = “Eliminate”` attribute to the `<EntityMap>` tag. This assures that if the file contains duplicate rows for the entity type, a single row is used to minimize lookup related errors.  
  
You can download an example of a data map with multiple entity types from [Microsoft Downloads: DataImportMaps.zip](https://download.microsoft.com/download/D/5/F/D5F73E15-439B-4EBC-BFFB-C6837B146C76/DataImportMaps.zip). Look at the `MapForSalesForceContactAccount.xml` file.  
  
 The field values in the source file can be separated by commas, tabs, or other characters that are defined in the `ImportFile.FieldDelimiterCode` attribute.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Do not use non-printable characters, **null** (\0) or break (\b), as delimiters for the field values.  
  
 The first row in the source file should contain column headings. If you do not include headings, use the `ImportFile.IsFirstRowHeader` attribute to specify that the first row represents actual data. In this case, default column headings are created with the names Col1, Col2, and so on.
