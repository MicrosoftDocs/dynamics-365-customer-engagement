# Privilege and role entities

A *privilege* is a permission to perform an action on a specific entity type in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]. The platform checks for the privilege and fails if the user does not hold the privilege. A privilege has an associated access level that determines the depth within the organization to which the privilege applies.  
  
 A *role*, or security role, is a grouping of security privileges. Users are assigned roles that authorize their access to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. A user must be assigned to at least one role. It isnâ€™t sufficient to be a member of a team that has an assigned role.  
  
 For more information about access levels and roles, see [How Role-Based Security Can Be Used to Control Access to Entities In Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises)](security-dev/how-role-based-security-control-access-entities.md).  
  
 The following illustration shows the entity relationships for this area. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Key to Entity Diagrams](/powerapps/developer/data-platform/use-metadata-generate-entity-diagrams#about-the-diagrams)
