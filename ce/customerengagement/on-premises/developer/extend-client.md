# Extend Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement on the client

This section contains information about changes developers and customizers can make to extend [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)] in the clients provided for [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] -- the web application, [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Dynamics_CRM_Mobile](../includes/pn-dyn-365-phones.md)], and [!INCLUDE[pn_moca_full](../includes/pn-moca-full.md)] -- by using [!INCLUDE[pn_JavaScript](../includes/pn-javascript.md)] and web resources. These clients are designed to allow you to add extensions that can be applied for all clients rather than each one separately.  
  
 Client extensions can provide a very rich and responsive experience for users because the code runs on their device. However, critical business logic should not be applied only by client-side scripts. Unlike extensions that are applied on the server, client extensions canâ€™t apply business logic for data entering the system by other means, such as integrations with other systems, custom clients, or data import.
