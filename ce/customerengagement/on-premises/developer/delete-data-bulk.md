# Delete data in bulk

The *bulk deletion* feature helps you to maintain data quality and manage the consumption of system storage in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) by deleting data that you no longer need.  
  
 For example, you can delete the following data in bulk:  
  
- Stale data.  
  
- Data that is irrelevant to the business.  
  
- Unneeded test or sample data.  
  
- Data that is incorrectly imported from other systems.  
  
  With bulk deletion you can perform the following operations:  
  
- Delete data across multiple entities.  
  
- Delete records for a specified entity.  
  
- Receive email notifications when a bulk deletion finishes.  
  
- Delete data periodically.  
  
- Schedule the start time of a recurring bulk delete.  
  
- Retrieve the information about the failures that occurred during a bulk deletion.  
  
## Run bulk delete

To delete data in bulk, you have to submit a bulk delete job by using the BulkDeleteRequest message. The bulk delete job runs asynchronously in the background without blocking other activities. The query expressions that describe the records on which to run the bulk delete job are specified in the QuerySet property of this request. To learn more, see [Running Bulk Delete](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/delete-data-bulk#run-bulk-delete) in the Dataverse documentation.
