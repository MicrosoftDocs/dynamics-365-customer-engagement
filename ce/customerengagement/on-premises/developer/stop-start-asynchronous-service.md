# Stop and start the asynchronous service

[!INCLUDE[cc_sdk_onpremises_note](../includes/cc-sdk-onpremises-note.md)] 

For Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) (including IFD) deployments, the asynchronous service can be stopped and restarted by using the Services administrative tool. The service should be stopped before a plug-in assembly that contains asynchronous plug-ins is deleted.  
  
### Stop and restart the service  
  
1. Navigate to **Start**, select **Administrative Tools**, then click **Services**.  
  
2. Right-click **Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement Asynchronous Processing Service** in the **Name** column of the service listing.  
  
3. Click **Start** or **Stop**. Or, you can click **Properties** in the shortcut menu and then click **Start** or **Stop** in the dialog box.  
  
   You must have System Administrator privileges to stop or start the service.
