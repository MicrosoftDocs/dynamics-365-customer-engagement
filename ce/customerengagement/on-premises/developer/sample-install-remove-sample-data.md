# Sample: Install or remove sample data

This sample shows how to install or uninstall the sample data for an organization by using the [InstallSampleDataRequest](/dotnet/api/microsoft.crm.sdk.messages.installsampledatarequest?view=dynamics-general-ce-9&preserve-view=true) message. You can download the sample from [here](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/dataverse/orgsvc/CSharp/InstallOrRemove).

## How to run this sample

[!include[cc-how-to-run-samples](includes/cc-how-to-run-PA-samples.md)]

## What this sample does

The `InstallSampleDataRequest` message is intended to be used in a scenario where it contains data that is needed to install the sample data.

## How this sample works

In order to simulate the scenario described in [What this sample does](#what-this-sample-does), the sample will do the following:

### Setup

1. Checks for the current version of the org.

### Demonstrate

1. Prompts users to install or remove sample data.
2. If the user opts to install sample data, the `InstallSampleDataRequest` message installs the sample data.
3. If the user opts to uninstall the sample data, the `UninstallSampleDataRequest` message removes the sample data.

### Clean up

Display an option to delete the records in [Setup](#setup). The deletion is optional in case you want to examine the entities and data created by the sample. You can manually delete the records to achieve the same result.
