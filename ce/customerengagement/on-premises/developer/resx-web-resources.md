# String (RESX) web resources

Use these web resources to manage localized strings in any user interface you define or with error messages you will display. 

> [!NOTE]
> String (RESX) web resources were added with the [!INCLUDE[../includes/pn-crm-9-0-0-online.md](../includes/pn-crm-9-0-0-online.md)].

## Using RESX web resources

RESX web resources contain the keys and localized string values for a single language defined using the RESX XML format. RESX is a common format for defining localized resources for windows applications, so there is common tooling available to work with this type of file and localization vendors will be familiar with working with them. When the file is published as a web resource in CRM, it will be converted to a JSON format, which will be downloaded to the application when needed.

When you create RESX web resources, you must explicitly set the language value and include the locale identifier (LCID) for the appropriate language in the name of the web resource. For example, `new_/strings/MyAppResources.1033.resx` would contain resources for English language. See [Microsoft Locale ID Values](/previous-versions/windows/embedded/ms912047(v=winembedded.10)) for a list of LCID values.

To extract the localized value, use the [Xrm.Utility.getResourceString](/powerapps/developer/model-driven-apps/clientapi/reference/Xrm-Utility/getResourceString) function. This function accepts two parameters: `WebResourceName` and `keyValue`. 

For example, `Xrm.Utility.getResourceString("new_/strings/MyAppResources","hello")` will return the localized string value for the resource key hello within the `new_/strings/MyAppResources.1033.resx` web resource if the user’s preferred language is English. Notice that the function doesn’t refer to any specific language or full name of any RESX web resource. This functionality depends on the RESX web resource being associated to the calling JavaScript web resource as a dependency. More information: [Web Resource dependencies](web-resource-dependencies.md).

The appropriate string value will be determined by the individual user’s language preference and the languages available in the organization. If a localized string is not found that matches the user’s language preference, the localized string will automatically fallback to the base language for the organization. If no matching localized string is found for the organizations base language, a null value will be returned.
