# Modify the messages for an entity

When you customize system entity or system attribute display names, some messages displayed by Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) will reference the default display names. Edit the default messages to match your customized display names.  
  
## Edit messages by exporting, editing, and importing translations

 You can edit text values for the base language exported by using the feature that allows for exporting and importing translations. When you export translations, you will download a compressed file. Extract the files and edit the CRMTranslations.xml file by using [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Excel_Full](../includes/pn-ms-excel-full.md)]. You can edit display strings and localized labels. After editing the base language data in the exported file, you must compress the XRMTranslations.xml and [Content_Types].xml files and import them.
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You should evaluate each instance of the strings you want to change and look for variants that include uppercase letters or plural references. Avoid using a global find/replace.
  
## Manually edit entity messages

 For entity messages related to a specific entity, you can manually edit these messages in the entity customization user interface. You must save and publish each message and then publish customizations for your changes to be applied.

> [!NOTE]
> The messages displayed in the user interface for a particular entity may not include every instance of the entity name for that entity.  
  
 <!-- Remove the section below if Bug 700890 is not fixed -->

## Programmatically update entity display strings

 The display strings are stored in the `DisplayString` entity. Note this entity doesnâ€™t contain the default display strings. The two attributes for this entity that contain text are `CustomDisplayString` and `PublishedDisplayString`. By default, these attribute values are `null` unless the display string has been customized.
