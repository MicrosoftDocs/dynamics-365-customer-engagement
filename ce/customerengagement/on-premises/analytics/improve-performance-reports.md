# Improve performance of reports

Here are some guidelines that can help you improve the performance of the report.  
  
## General  
 These guidelines are applicable for both Fetch-based reports.  
  
- Limit a report to display information from a specified time period, instead of displaying all records in the apps database.  
  
- Pre-filter a report so that the dataset is limited.  
  
- Calculate aggregate totals by using aggregations in a FetchXML query, instead of passing raw data to Reporting Services and grouping.  
  
- Limit the number of datasets used, if possible.  
  
- When you compare dates, use the UTC date fields for comparisons. For example, compare the `createdonutc` fields and not the `createdon` fields in the FetchXML query or a filtered view.
