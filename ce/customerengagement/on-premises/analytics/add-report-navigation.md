# Add report navigation

Report navigation enables a dynamic and interactive reporting experience. By using various types of actions, reports let the user navigate to detailed reports, records, or other websites.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  For more information about report navigation, see [Drillthrough, Drilldown, Subreports, and Nested Data Regions (Report Builder and SSRS)](/sql/reporting-services/report-design/drillthrough-drilldown-subreports-and-nested-data-regions) in the [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_SQL_Server](../includes/pn-ms-sql-server.md)] documentation. This topic describes report navigation that is specific to [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps reports.  
  
## Dynamic drill through  
 You can drill through a report to navigate to an apps web form. A drill-through report is implemented in the following steps:  
  
1. An image or value item (such as a text box) is added to a report. The `Value` property of this item contains code that builds a URL by using the base address of the app plus parameters that refer to a specific record.  
  
2. When the user selects the report item, a new browser window is opened by using the constructed URL passed as the target web address.  
  
3. Customer Engagement (on-premises) load the information for the specified entity into a web form that is displayed in the browser window.  
  
### To set up a drill-through report in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) 
  
1. Create a hidden parameter of type string in the report that has the name CRM_URL. For more information about adding parameters, see [Use Parameters in Reports](../analytics/use-parameters-in-reports.md). When the report is run, this parameter is automatically set to the web address of [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps.  
  
2. Add a report item, such as a **Textbox**.  
  
3. Right-click the drill-through report item and select **Properties** from the shortcut menu.  
  
4. Click **Advanced**.  
  
5. In the **Navigation** tab, click **Jump to URL** and enter an expression in the following format:  
  
   ```sql  
   = Parameters!CRM_URL.Value & "?ID={"& GUID &"}&LogicalName=entity logical name"  
   ```  
  
    The entity GUID and entity logical name have to be added to the URL to be able to drill through. For example:  
  
   ```sql  
   = Parameters!CRM_URL.Value & "?ID={"&Fields!Opportunityid.Value.ToString()&"}&LogicalName=opportunity"  
   ```  
  
6. Click **OK**.  
  
   In this example code, the value of a dataset field that contains the GUID of an `Opportunity` object is converted to a string and used as an ID parameter in the URL. A parameter that contains the LogicalName value for an opportunity entity is also appended.  
  
   The GUID of a record can be obtained from the appropriate filtered view, for example, `FilteredOpportunity`.
