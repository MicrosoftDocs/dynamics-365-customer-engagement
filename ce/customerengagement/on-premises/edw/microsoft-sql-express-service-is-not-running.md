# Microsoft SQL Express service is not running

## Cause
  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_SQL_Server_Express_long](../includes/pn-ms-sql-server-express-long.md)] service is not running on this computer.  
  
 ## Solution
  
 Setup will try to start the service. To verify, click **Back** to restart the check. If [!INCLUDE[pn_Setup](../includes/pn-setup.md)] cannot start the service, in the Windows **Run** box, type `services.msc`, and try to start [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_short](../includes/pn-sql-server-short.md)] (Express instance) manually.
