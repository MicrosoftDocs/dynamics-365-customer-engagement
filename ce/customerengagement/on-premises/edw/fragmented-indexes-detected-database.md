# Fragmented indexes were detected in the Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement database

## Cause
  
 This warning can occur when the indexes in the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] database are significantly fragmented. Heavily fragmented indexes can degrade query performance.  
  
 ## Solution
  
 This is a warning and Setup can continue. However, we recommend that you remedy the index fragmentation by either reorganizing or rebuilding the indexes. After you have successfully defragmented the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] database, run Setup again. For more information see [Reorganize and Rebuild Indexes](/sql/relational-databases/indexes/reorganize-and-rebuild-indexes) in SQL Server Books Online.
