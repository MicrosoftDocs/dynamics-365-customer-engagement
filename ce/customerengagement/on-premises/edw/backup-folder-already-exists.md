# Backup folder already exists

## Cause
  
 During upgrade, Setup backs up the existing deploymentâ€™s files to the C:\program files\MSCRM\backup folder.  
  
 If this folder already exists, Setup cannot back up the program files before the upgrade.  
  
 ## Solution
  
1.  Stop and exit Setup.  
  
2.  Copy the files that are in the C:\program files\MSCRM\backup folder to another location and then manually delete the folder.  
  
3.  Run Setup again.
