# The account specified for the service is a member of the PrivUserGroup and is used by another service

## Cause
  
 The account specified for the service described in Setup is a member of the [!INCLUDE[pn_Active_Directory](../includes/pn-active-directory.md)] PrivUserGroup and is being used or specified to be used by another service.  
  
 ## Solution
  
 For a more secure deployment, we recommend that you specify a separate least-privileged domain user account.
