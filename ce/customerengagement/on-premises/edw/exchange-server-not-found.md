# Microsoft Exchange Server not found or is not a supported version

## Cause
  
 The [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange_Server_full](../includes/pn-exchange-server-full.md)] specified in a previous setup screen is either not a valid [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange_Server_short](../includes/pn-exchange-server-short.md)], is a version that is not supported, or is a version that has limited support.  
  
 ## Solution
  
 If this is an error, you must specify a version of [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Exchange](../includes/pn-microsoft-exchange.md)] that is supported. If this is a warning, see the following link.
