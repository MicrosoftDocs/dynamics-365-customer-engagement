# Business Intelligence Development Studio is not installed for Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services

## Cause
  
 SQL Server Data Tools is not installed on the computer. This application is required to install [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-reporting-extensions-server-side](../includes/pn-crm-reporting-extensions-server-side.md)].  
  
 ## Solution
  
 To resolve this requirement, install SQL Server Data Tools. More information: [Report writing environment using SQL Server Data Tools](../analytics/report-writing-environment-using-sql-server-data-tools.md).
