# This version of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Server does not support installing separate server roles

## Cause
  
 The edition of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] does not support installing server roles on separate computers.  
  
## Solution
  
 Select the needed solution.  
  
-   Remove the element that is named Roles in the XML configuration file. Then, run Setup again to install all server roles on the computer.  
  
-   Obtain a [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)] Edition license. This version of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] supports installing server roles on separate computers.
