# Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement log file does not exist

## Cause
  
 Setup cannot find the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] database file (.mdf) or the transaction log file (.ldf) for the selected database.  
  
 ## Solution
  
 To resolve this issue, perform one of the following actions:  
  
-   Restore the database or transaction log file for the associated database, and then run Setup again.  
  
-   Remove the .mdf or .ldf file from the folder, and then run Setup again and choose to create a new database.
