# Could not find file install.xml

## Cause
  
 Setup cannot find the &lt;path&gt;\install.xml file. This file is required to complete the upgrade.  
  
 ## Solution
  
 Locate the install.xml file in the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] installation media and copy the file to the path that is specified in the error message.
