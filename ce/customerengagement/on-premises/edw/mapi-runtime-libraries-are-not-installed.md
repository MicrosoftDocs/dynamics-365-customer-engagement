# MAPI runtime libraries are not installed

## Cause

 The Messaging Application Program Interface (MAPI) runtime libraries are not installed. This component is required by the [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_E-Mail_Router](../includes/pn-crm-e-mail-router.md)].  
  
 ## Solution
  
 For download information and installation instructions, see [MAPI client runtime libraries](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=78805).
