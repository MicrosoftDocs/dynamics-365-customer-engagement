# One or more Microsoft Dynamics 365 Servers are disabled

## Cause
  
 The operation canâ€™t be completed because one or more [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] servers are in a disabled state.  
  
 ## Solution
  
 Start [!INCLUDE[pn_deploymentmanager](../includes/pn-deploymentmanager.md)], and, in the **Servers** area, enable each [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)] that is disabled. Alternatively, you can use the [Enable-CrmServer](/powershell/module/microsoft.crm.powershell/enable-crmserver?view=dynamics365ce-ps&preserve-view=true) [!INCLUDE[pn_PowerShell](../includes/pn-powershell.md)] cmdlet or the methods that are described in the [!INCLUDE[pn_sdk](../includes/pn-sdk.md)].
