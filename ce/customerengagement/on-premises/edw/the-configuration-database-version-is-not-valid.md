# The configuration database version is not valid

## Cause
  
 The [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] configuration database (MSCRM_CONFIG) is not the correct version.  
  
 This issue can occur for the following reasons:  
  
-   The existing database version is later than the version of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] you are installing.  
  
-   You are attempting to install [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-reporting-extensions-server-side](../includes/pn-crm-reporting-extensions-server-side.md)] before upgrading [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)].  
  
## Solution
  
 Select the following solution that is most appropriate for you.  
  
-   Redeploying [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] by installing an earlier version of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)] is not supported. You must use a version that is supported by the existing configuration database.  
  
-   You must first upgrade [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)] before you install [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-reporting-extensions-server-side](../includes/pn-crm-reporting-extensions-server-side.md)].
