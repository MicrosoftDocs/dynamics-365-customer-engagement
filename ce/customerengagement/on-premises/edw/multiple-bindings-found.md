# Multiple bindings found
[!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)] must run on a website that has a single binding. Although IIS supports multiple HTTP and HTTPS bindings, there is a limitation in using additional bindings with [!INCLUDE[pn_WCF_long](../includes/pn-wcf-long.md)]. Multiple IIS bindings, such as a website with two HTTPS or two HTTP bindings, are not supported for running [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)].  
  
 Before you install or upgrade, you must remove the additional bindings from the website used for [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] or select a different website.
