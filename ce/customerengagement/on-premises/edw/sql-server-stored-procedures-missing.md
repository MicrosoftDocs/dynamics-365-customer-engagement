# One or more Microsoft SQL Server stored procedures are missing

## Cause
  
 Setup cannot find one or more [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_short](../includes/pn-sql-server-short.md)] stored procedures that are required to upgrade the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] database.  
  
## Solution
  
 This is a warning message. [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] should still upgrade successfully.  
  
 To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Customer Support Services. For a complete list of Microsoft Customer Support Services telephone numbers and information about support costs, visit the Microsoft [Help and Support Contact](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=99244) webpage.
