# Invalid customization of metadata configured

## Cause
  
 There is an invalid customization of metadata configured (a timestamp data type) in the organization database. This customization will be lost if you continue with the organization import.  
  
 ## Solution
  
 This is a warning and you can continue with the import. However, we recommend that you review the Setup log file (c:\Users\\<user\>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\MSCRM\Logs) to determine whether the customization can be removed. If the customization is removed, such as a customization created from a solution, the solution may not work after the organization database is imported.
