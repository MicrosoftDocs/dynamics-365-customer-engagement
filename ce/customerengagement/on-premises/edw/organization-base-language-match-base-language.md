# The organization base language does not match the server base language

## Cause
  
 The organization base language does not match the server base language. To complete the operation, the base languages must match.  
  
## Solution
  
 Performing this operation, such as importing an organization, by using a different base language than that of the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] deployment is not supported. Additionally, you cannot change the base language of a [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] deployment or an organization once it is created. To complete the operation, you must use a [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] deployment that has the same base language as the organization.
