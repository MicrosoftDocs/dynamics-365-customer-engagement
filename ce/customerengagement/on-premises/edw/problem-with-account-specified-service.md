# There is a problem with the account specified to run the Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement service
Review the message in the [!INCLUDE [pn-environment-diagnostics-wizard](../includes/pn-environment-diagnostics-wizard.md)] and select the cause and associated solution that is most appropriate.  
  
 ## Cause 1
  
 The account specified for the service displayed in the [!INCLUDE [pn-environment-diagnostics-wizard](../includes/pn-environment-diagnostics-wizard.md)] message is not valid.  
  
 ## Solution 1
  
-   Verify that the user account name is valid and the password is correct. Additionally, the user account logon must use one of the following formats.  
  
    -   Domain\user  
  
    -   user@domain.com  
  
-   Verify that the user account is a domain user in the same [!INCLUDE[pn_Active_Directory](../includes/pn-active-directory.md)] domain as the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] deployment.  
  
-   Verify that the user account is not a local system account.  
  
-   Verify that the credentials specified in the XML Setup configuration file or on the **Specify Service Accounts** page in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] Setup are valid. For more information, see [Minimum permissions required for Microsoft Dynamics CRM Setup, services, and components](/previous-versions/dynamicscrm-2016/deployment-administrators-guide/hh699825(v=crm.8)).  
  
 ## Cause 2
  
 Setup has detected that the specified user account is the same account that is running Setup.  
  
 ## Solution 2
  
 Using the account specified for the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] service described in Setup can cause unexpected behavior. We strongly recommend that you specify an account that is not also the user who is running Setup.  
  
 ## Cause 3
  
 The account specified for the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] service displayed in the [!INCLUDE [pn-environment-diagnostics-wizard](../includes/pn-environment-diagnostics-wizard.md)] message doesnâ€™t have permission to use performance counters. The service needs this permission to function correctly. By default, the Performance Log Users and Administrators groups on the local computer have this permission.  
  
 ## Solution 3
  
 Add the service account to the **Performance Log Users** local group or specify an account that already has this permission. Alternatively, you can use the Network Service account.
