# The organization already has another Reporting Services instance configured

## Cause 
  
 [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-reporting-extensions-server-side](../includes/pn-crm-reporting-extensions-server-side.md)] Setup is about to be installed for a [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-reporting-extensions-server-side](../includes/pn-crm-reporting-extensions-server-side.md)] instance that is different from the one that is being used by the organization.  
  
## Solution
  
 There are two possible solutions.  
  
1.  Configure all organizations to set the specified [!INCLUDE[pn_reporting_services_short](../includes/pn-reporting-services-short.md)] instance as the [!INCLUDE[pn_reporting_services_short](../includes/pn-reporting-services-short.md)] by using the **Edit Organization Wizard** in [!INCLUDE[pn_deploymentmanager](../includes/pn-deploymentmanager.md)].  
  
2.  Specify the [!INCLUDE[pn_reporting_services_short](../includes/pn-reporting-services-short.md)] that is already defined for the organizations.  
  
 This is a warning and Setup can continue. [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-reporting-extensions-server-side](../includes/pn-crm-reporting-extensions-server-side.md)] Setup will install the [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-reporting-extensions-server-side](../includes/pn-crm-reporting-extensions-server-side.md)] but will not publish the reports for the organizations. Notice that the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] out-of-box reports will not work until they are published.
