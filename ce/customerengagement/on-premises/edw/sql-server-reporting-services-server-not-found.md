# Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services server was not found

## Cause
  
 Setup cannot find [!INCLUDE[pn_reporting_services_short](../includes/pn-reporting-services-short.md)] server by using the specified URL. The following causes are possible reasons for this failure:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[pn_reporting_services_short](../includes/pn-reporting-services-short.md)] server is not installed on the specified computer.  
  
-   If the [!INCLUDE[pn_reporting_services_short](../includes/pn-reporting-services-short.md)] server is installed on a different computer, a network connectivity problem is preventing this test from completing.  
  
-   The URL specified is incorrect or invalid.  
  
-   You may not have sufficient permissions for the specified [!INCLUDE[pn_reporting_services_short](../includes/pn-reporting-services-short.md)] server.  
  
-   The default website does not exist, is not running, or is not valid.  
  
## Solution
  
 Verify the following conditions, and then run Setup again:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[pn_reporting_services_short](../includes/pn-reporting-services-short.md)] is installed on the specified computer.  
  
-   If the [!INCLUDE[pn_reporting_services_short](../includes/pn-reporting-services-short.md)] server is installed on a different computer, verify network connectivity.  
  
-   Verify that you have at least local administrator group membership on the [!INCLUDE[pn_reporting_services_short](../includes/pn-reporting-services-short.md)] server.  
  
-   Verify that you can connect to the [!INCLUDE[pn_reporting_services_short](../includes/pn-reporting-services-short.md)] server by entering the [!INCLUDE[pn_reporting_services_short](../includes/pn-reporting-services-short.md)] URL in a web browser.
