# Connections to the computer running Microsoft SQL Server must be closed

## Cause
  
 There are active connections to the computer that is running [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_SQL_Server](../includes/pn-ms-sql-server.md)]. All connections must be closed before Setup can continue.  
  
 ## Solution
  
 To resolve this problem, specify a different computer that is running [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_short](../includes/pn-sql-server-short.md)] or contact Microsoft Customer Support Services.
