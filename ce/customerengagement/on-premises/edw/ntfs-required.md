# NTFS required

## Cause
  
 The file system on the hard-disk partition running [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] must be NTFS.  
  
 ## Solution
  
 For more information about how to convert a FAT or FAT32 file system to NTFS, see [Reformatting or converting a partition to use NTFS](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc783213(v=ws.10)).
