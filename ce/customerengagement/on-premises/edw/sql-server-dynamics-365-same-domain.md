# Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft Dynamics 365 Server must be in the same domain

## Cause
  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)] and the instance of [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_SQL_Server](../includes/pn-ms-sql-server.md)] that is being used for the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] data must be in the same [!INCLUDE[pn_Active_Directory](../includes/pn-active-directory.md)] directory service domain.  
  
## Solution
  
 Make sure that the computer you are trying to connect to (the one that is running [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_short](../includes/pn-sql-server-short.md)]) is in the same [!INCLUDE[pn_Active_Directory](../includes/pn-active-directory.md)] domain as the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)].
