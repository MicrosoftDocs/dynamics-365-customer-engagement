# The version of Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement that is installed cannot be upgraded

## Cause
  
 The version of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] that is installed cannot be upgraded to the version youâ€™ve selected.  
  
## Solution
  
 You must first upgrade your version of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] to a suitable version. For more information, see [Plan your upgrade to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Server](../deploy/plan-your-upgrade-to-microsoft-dynamics-365-server.md).
