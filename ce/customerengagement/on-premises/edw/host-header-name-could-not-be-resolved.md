# Host header name could not be resolved

## Cause

Setup cannot resolve the host header name because a Domain Name System (DNS) entry does not exist.  
  
## Solution

Host header names must be mapped by using a DNS server or a Hosts file. For more information about configuring a DNS server, view the Help in the DNS service documentation.
