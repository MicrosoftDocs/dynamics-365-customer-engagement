# SQL Server plan guides were detected

## Cause
  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_SQL_Server](../includes/pn-ms-sql-server.md)] plan guides where detected on the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] database stored procedures and functions.  
  
## Solution
  
 Remove [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_short](../includes/pn-sql-server-short.md)] plan guides from the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] database stored procedures and functions. More information: [Delete a Plan Guide](/sql/relational-databases/performance/delete-a-plan-guide?view=sql-server-2017)
