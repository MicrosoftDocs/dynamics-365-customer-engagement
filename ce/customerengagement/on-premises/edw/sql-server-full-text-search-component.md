# Microsoft SQL Server full-text search component is not installed

## Cause
  
 The [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_short](../includes/pn-sql-server-short.md)] full-text search service is not installed. This service is required for searching articles in the knowledge base in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].  
  
## Solution
  
 Install or enable full-text search. For information about full-text search with [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_short](../includes/pn-sql-server-short.md)], see [Get Started with Full-Text Search](/sql/relational-databases/search/get-started-with-full-text-search?view=sql-server-2017&preserve-view=true).
