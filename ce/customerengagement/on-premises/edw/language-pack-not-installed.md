# Language Pack not installed

## Cause
  
 The organization you are importing does not have a [!INCLUDE[pn_Language_Pack_short](../includes/pn-language-pack-short.md)] installed that matches the base language of the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] deployment. This issue can occur when you import an organization into a new [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] deployment.  
  
 ## Solution
  
 Install the language pack that is referenced in the details of this check. This language matches the base language of the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] deployment.
