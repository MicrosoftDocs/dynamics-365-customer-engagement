# Windows Search Service is installed

## Cause
  
 Setup has detected that the Windows Search Service role service is installed on this computer. This service cannot be installed on the same computer as the Indexing Service, which is required for the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] Help Server role.  
  
## Solution

### Uninstall Windows Search Service  
  
1.  Start Server Manager.  
  
2.  Expand **Roles**, right-click **File Services**, and then select **Remove Role Services**.  
  
3.  In the Select Role Services wizard, clear the option for **Windows Search Service**, and then select **Next**.  
  
4.  Select **Remove** and follow the instructions on your screen. You will be required to restart your computer.
