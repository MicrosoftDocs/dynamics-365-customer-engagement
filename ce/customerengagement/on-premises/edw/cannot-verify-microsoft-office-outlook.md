# Cannot verify Microsoft Office Outlook

## Cause
  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Outlook_Full](../includes/pn-ms-outlook-full.md)] is either not installed, is not the correct version or service pack level, or has not been started at least one time before installing [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)].  
  
 ## Solution
  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] requires that Outlook be installed and started before you install [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)]. Starting Outlook for the first time configures a default user profile.
