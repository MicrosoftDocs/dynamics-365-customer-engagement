# Language inconsistency

## Cause
  
 Setup has detected that you are trying to upgrade [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] to a different language. Setup will succeed only if the language edition you are upgrading to is the same as your existing [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] language edition.  
  
 ## Solution
  
 Upgrade using the same language edition as your [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] language edition. For example, if your [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] language edition is Spanish, then you must upgrade to the Spanish edition of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].  
  
 The exception is upgrading from an International English edition of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] to a US English edition of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]. This upgrade is supported and recommended.
