# Verify Service Principal Name for Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement service accounts
The [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] services are described below. For information on permissions for service accounts, see [Minimum permissions required for Microsoft Dynamics CRM Setup and services](/previous-versions/dynamicscrm-2016/deployment-administrators-guide/hh699825(v=crm.8)).  
  
-   **Application Service**. This service runs the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] Web application that is used to connect users to [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] data.  
  
-   **Deployment Web Service**. Manages the deployment by using the methods described in the [!INCLUDE[pn_sdk](../includes/pn-sdk.md)], such as create an organization or remove a Deployment Administrator role from a user.  
  
-   **Sandbox Processing Service**. Enables an isolated environment to allow for the execution of custom code, such as plug-ins. This isolated environment reduces the possibility of custom code affecting the operation of the organizations in the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] deployment.  
  
-   **Asynchronous Processing Service**. Processes queued asynchronous events, such as bulk e-mail or data import.  
  
-   **Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement VSS Writer Service**. Provides the interface to back up and restore [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] databases through the Windows Server Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) infrastructure.  
  
-   **Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement Monitoring Service**. Provides diagnostic services for the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] services.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  -   We strongly recommend that you select a low-privilege domain account that is dedicated to running these services and is not used for any other purpose. Additionally, the user account that is used to run a [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] service cannot be a [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] user. This domain account must be a member of the Domain Users group. Additionally, if the Asynchronous Service and Sandbox Processing Service roles are installed, such as in a Full Server or a Back End Server installation, the domain account must a member of the Performance Log Users security group.  
> -   If you select to run the ASP.NET service under a domain user account that is not a domain administrator or a local administrator, you must set a local security policy after you install [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)] for the ASP.NET service to work correctly. Also, depending on the password policies that you have implemented for your organization, the password for the user may expire.  
> -   The service account may need an SPN for the URL used to access the Web site that is associated with it.  
  
 You use the setspn.exe command-line tool to read, modify, and delete the Service Principal Names (SPN) directory property for an [!INCLUDE[pn_Active_Directory](../includes/pn-active-directory.md)] service account. Setspn is included with [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Windows_Server_long](../includes/pn-ms-windows-server-long.md)]. Notice that you must have **Validated write to service principal name** permissions to complete operations using setspn. For more information about setspn, see [Setspn](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc731241(v=ws.10)).
