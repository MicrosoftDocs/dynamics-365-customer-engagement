# Microsoft SQL Server language identifier is not valid

## Cause
  
 The Language ID registry setting that indicates the language edition of the installed [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)] is not consistent with any of the languages that [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] is available in. Without the correct language ID, Setup cannot determine local functions or authenticate that [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_SQL_Server](../includes/pn-ms-sql-server.md)] collation will work with your selected language.  
  
 ## Solution
  
 To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Customer Support Services. For a complete list of Microsoft Customer Support Services telephone numbers and information about support costs, visit the Microsoft [Help and Support Contact](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=99244) webpage.
