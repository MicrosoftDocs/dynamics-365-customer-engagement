# Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement Reporting Extensions must be installed

## Cause
  
  [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-reporting-extensions-server-side](../includes/pn-crm-reporting-extensions-server-side.md)] are not installed on the [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_Reporting](../includes/pn-sql-server-reporting.md)] instance specified for the organization. This feature is required for [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] reports functionality.  
  
 ## Solution
  
 Install [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-reporting-extensions-server-side](../includes/pn-crm-reporting-extensions-server-side.md)]. For information about how to install [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-reporting-extensions-server-side](../includes/pn-crm-reporting-extensions-server-side.md)], see [Install Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement Reporting Extensions](../deploy/install-microsoft-dynamics-365-reporting-extensions.md).
