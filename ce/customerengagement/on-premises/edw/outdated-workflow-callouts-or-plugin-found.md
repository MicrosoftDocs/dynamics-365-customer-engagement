# Outdated workflow callouts or plug-in callouts were found

## Cause
  
 Workflow callouts (Microsoft CRM 3.0 callout workflow custom activities) or plug-in callouts (Microsoft.Crm.Extensibility.V3CalloutProxyPlugin) were found in the system. These customizations will no longer work after this operation completes.  
  
## Solution
  
 Upgrade or remove the callout. If there are outdated plug-ins, upgrade or uninstall the plug-in. For more information, see [Removal of the 2007 Endpoint and Legacy Features](/previous-versions/dynamicscrm-2016/developers-guide/dn281891(v=crm.8)) and [Upgrade Your Code from Microsoft Dynamics CRM 4.0 to Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011](/previous-versions/dynamicscrm-2013/developers-guide/gg334220(v=crm.6)).
