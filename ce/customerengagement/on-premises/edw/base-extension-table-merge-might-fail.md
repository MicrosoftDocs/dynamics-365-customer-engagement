# The Base Extension table merge process might fail due to limits on SQL Server table row size

## Cause
  
 Combining the Base and Extension tables might exceed SQL Server limits and cause the merge operation to fail. This can be caused by a large number of attributes on the reported entities.  
  
 ## Solution
  
 Remove unused attributes or move some of the attributes to a related entity. You can also disable the Base Extension table merge process for your import.
