# There is insufficient disk space to install Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement

## Cause
  
 To install [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)], you must have at least 10 gigabytes (GB) of free disk space.  
  
 To install [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] for [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Outlook_Full](../includes/pn-ms-outlook-full.md)], you must have at least 1.5 GB of free disk space.  
  
 ## Solution
  
 Make more disk space available or install [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] on a drive that has sufficient space.
