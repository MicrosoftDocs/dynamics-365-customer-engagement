# Pending asynchronous events were detected

## Cause
  
 There are unprocessed asynchronous events, such as workflows, pending in the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] system. These events should complete before [!INCLUDE[pn_Setup](../includes/pn-setup.md)] can continue.  
  
## Solution

 Exit [!INCLUDE[pn_Setup](../includes/pn-setup.md)] and wait for these events to finish processing. If needed, you can cancel the asynchronous event. For more information, see [Monitor or manage workflow processes](/flow/monitor-manage-processes).
