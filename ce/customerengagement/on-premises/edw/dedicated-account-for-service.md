# We recommend a dedicated domain user account for this Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement service

## Cause
  
 Setup has detected that a dedicated least-privileged domain user account is not specified for the service listed in the warning message.  
  
 ## Solution
  
 This is a warning and Setup can continue. However, for a more secure deployment of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)], we recommend that you specify a separate least-privileged user account for each [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] service. For more information, see [Minimum permissions required for Microsoft Dynamics CRM Setup and services](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=306136).
