# Installation folder location is not valid

## Cause
  
 Setup has detected a problem with the installation folder location.  
  
 ## Solution
  
 Make sure the installation folder meets the following requirements:  
  
-   The folder must exist and have a valid path.  
  
-   The folder path specified must be an absolute path.  
  
-   The folder name must contain valid characters. For more information, see [Using special and extended characters](using-special-and-extended-characters.md).  
  
-   The user must have write privileges for the folder.  
  
-   The folder should be empty when Setup starts.
