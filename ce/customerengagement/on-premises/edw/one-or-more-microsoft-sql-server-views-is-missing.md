# One or more Microsoft SQL Server views is missing

## Cause
  
 Setup cannot find one or more [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_short](../includes/pn-sql-server-short.md)] views for the existing [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] database.  
  
 ## Solution
  
 This is a warning message. [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] should still install successfully.
