# Stay up-to-date with customer news with the activity feed

Monitor real-time updates in the activity feed to stay current with fast-moving sales, customer projects, and marketing campaigns at your organization.  
  
 You'll find the activity feed on your dashboard under the heading **What's new**.  
  
 The activity feed includes automatic updates about the work your colleagues are doing. You can also choose to "follow" updates for up to 1,000 of the contacts, colleagues, and customer records you care most about.  
  
## Like or unlike a post in the activity feed  
  
1. Under **What's new**, point to the post.  
  
2. Select **Like** or **Unlike**.  
  
   Below a post, you'll see the number of people who have liked it, and the names of people who liked the post most recently. Select the counter to see more names.  
  
## Comment on someone's post in the activity feed  
  
1.  Under **What's new**, point to the post.  
  
2.  Select **Reply**.  
  
3. Type your comment. You can use up to 250 characters.

## Control which types of posts you see in the activity feed  
 At the top of the activity feed, you'll see commands that let you control whether you see posts about everything you follow or a smaller subset.  
  
-   Under **What's new**, select one of the following:  
  
    - **All records**, and then select the type of records  
  
    - **Both** to see automatic posts and posts for the additional things you're following
