# Collaborate with your team

Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) offers a number of tools for collaboration. Through integration with other Microsoft collaboration tools, users of Customer Engagement (on-premises) can work closely with team members, even if they're not also users of Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises).

See [Collaborate with your colleagues using Microsoft 365 Groups](../basics/collaborate-with-colleagues-using-office-365-groups.md).
