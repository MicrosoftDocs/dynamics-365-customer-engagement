# Product reports

Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) includes many system reports that you can use to gain insights into how your business is doing. The product reports provides information on your product catalog. 


## Products by Account report
Use this report to see which products are used by an account. For each account, the report lists the products associated with the account.  
  
 By default, this report displays only line items for orders that don't have a status of **Canceled**, and line items for opportunities that have a status of **Won**.  


## Products by Contact report
Use this report to see which products are used by a contact. For each contact, the report lists the associated products.  
  
 The report shows orders that have not been cancelled and opportunities that you have won.
