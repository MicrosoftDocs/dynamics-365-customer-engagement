# Create a signature for your email or for a queue

Use an email signature in Customer Engagement (on-premises) Customer Engagement to save time and be consistent in your responses. The owner of an email signature can be a user or a team.  
  
## Create an email signature  
 To edit a signature if you are not a system administrator:  
  
1. Select the **Settings** button ![Options button for Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises).](../basics/media/optionsbutton.png "Options button for Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises)") in the upper-right corner of the screen.  
  
2. Select **Options**, and then select the **Email Signatures** tab.  
  
3. Choose **Email Signatures**.  
  
   To create a new email signature:  
  
4. On the Actions toolbar, select **New**.  
  
5. On the **Email Signature: New Email Signature** page, enter the following values:  
  
   - **Owner:** The user or team that owns this signature.  
  
   - **Language:** If you have multiple language packages installed, select the language for the signature you're composing.  
  
   - **Title:** The title for this email signature.  
   
6. Select **Save and Close**. Or, select > **Save** > **Set as Default** to make this the default email signature. 

## To edit a signature if you are a system administrator
  
1. Go to **Settings** > **Templates** > **Email Signatures**.
2. Select the signature that you wnat to update.
  
## Using email signatures  
 If you have a default signature, when you create a new email in Customer Engagement (on-premises) (for example, **Sales** > **Activities** > **Email**), an email signature is automatically added to the email based on the user you enter in the **From** field. An email signature must be defined for the user.  
  
 To change or add a signature, select **Insert Signature** on the menu bar on an email form.  
  
 When you open the Email Signatures page, email signatures you own are displayed. Change the view to **All Email Signatures** to see signatures created by others.  
  
## Things to know about email signatures  
  
- The owner of an email signature can create, update, or delete it.  
  
- Each user or team can have no more than one default email signature.  
  
- When you change the owner of an email signature, the signature reverts to non-default. For example, a signature is a default for user A. User A assigns it to queue X and queue X already has a default signature. The signature  assigned will be non-default for queue X. If queue X does not have a default signature, the new signature will become the default signature.  
  
- If the **From** field is changed to a user, the user email signature will appear. When you select **Insert Signature**, all the signatures that the user owns will appear. If the **From** field is changed to a queue,  the default email signature of the owner of the queue will appear. The owner of a queue can be a user or a team. When you select **Insert Signature**, all the email signatures that are owned by the queue owner (user or a team) will appear.
