# Enter new records fast with Quick Create

::: moniker range=">= op-9-1"


[!INCLUDE [applies-to-unified-interface](../includes/applies-to-unified-interface.md)]  [Create a new record](/powerapps/user/create-a-record)

The Quick Create command makes it fast and easy to enter almost any type of information into the system. The command is on the nav bar, so it's always available whenever you need to enter new info into the system.  
  
 With Quick Create, you need to complete only a few fields. Later, when you have more time or information, you can fill in more details.  
  
 You can quickly create:  
- Contacts  
- Accounts  
- Leads  
- Opportunities  
- Campaign responses  
- Competitors  
- Activities: tasks, phone calls, email, or appointments  
  <!--In [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_2015_and_online_full](../includes/pn-crm-2015-and-online-full.md)] or later, when you add a new sales opportunity to the system by using the **Create** command on the nav bar, you can now create a contact at the same time. In previous versions, you had to create the contact before using the Quick Create command to add an opportunity.  
  -->  
1.  On the nav bar, select the **plus sign**![Quick Create button.](../basics/media/filter-button.png "Quick Create button"), and then click the item you want.  
  
2.  Fill in the fields, and then click **Save**.  
  
3.  If you would like to continue adding information, select **View Record**. To create another one, select **Create Another**.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> ![Required Field button.](../basics/media/required-field-button.png "Required Field button") next to the field on the screen means it is a **Required** field.  
>   
> ![Recommended Field button.](../basics/media/recommended-field-button.png "Recommended Field button") next to the field on the screen means it is a **Recommended** field.
