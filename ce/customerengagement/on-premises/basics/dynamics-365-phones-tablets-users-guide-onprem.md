1. On the sign-in screen, select **Sign in with a web address instead**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Enter user name and password address](media/userandpassword.png "Enter your user name and password"). 

2. Enter the URL for your web address for the Dynamics 365 app that you use, and then select ![Sign in](media/signinarrow.png "Dynamics 365  for phones and tablets Preview sign-in"). 
3. Enter your user name and password.

## Clear cache from the device

If you used the mobile app on a phone or tablet temporarily and want to remove all your cached data before giving the device to someone else, you need to reconfigure the app.

Reconfiguring deletes data and metadata for the current organization from the cache, however do not rely on this as a security measure.

Make sure you use the **Reconfigure** option before you sign out. If you sign in to another organization but you wanted to delete data for the previous organization that you were logged into, then you will need to sign back into that organization and use the **Reconfigure** option to delete data and metadata for that organization from the cache.

## Search for records

You can search for records across multiple entities by using Relevance search or Categorized search. Relevance search delivers fast and comprehensive results across multiple entities, in a single list, sorted by relevance. Categorized search returns search results grouped by entity types, such as accounts, contacts or leads.

Normally, Categorized search is the default search option. However, if Relevance search is enabled by your organization, it becomes the default search experience.   
  
### Normal quick find (Categorized search) 
  
- **Begins with**: Results include records that begin with a specific word. For example, if you want to search for “Alpine Ski House,” type **alp** in the search box; if you type **ski**, the record won’t show up.  
  
- **Wildcard**: For example, *ski or *ski\*  
  
### Relevance search
  
- **Search within**: Results include records that contain a field with all of the words in the search term.  The individual words can appear anywhere in the string and in any order.  For example, if you search for “Alpine Ski House,” you could find results for “I left the house today to go skiing in the Alpine Meadows,” since all of the search words appear somewhere in the string.  

### Switch between Relevance and Categorized search

If your organization has turned on both search options (Relevance and Categorized search), then you can switch between the two.

1. To switch between search types, on the nav bar, select the Search button ![Search button](media/searchbutton.png).

2. At the top select the drop-down to switch between **Relevance Search** or **Categorized Search**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Switch between search type](media/switchsearch.png "Switch between search type")

### Start a search  
  
1.  On the nav bar, select the Search button ![Search button](media/searchbutton.png).
  
2.  Type your search words in the search box and then select Search button.  


### Search using the barcode scanner

Rather than manually typing a barcode number into a field, you can scan barcodes by using your device's camera. This makes it easy to capture info about inventory and other issues when you're out in the field. 

- To use the barcode scanner, when you are in search mode, select the Barcode Scanner button ![Bar code scanner button](media/barcodescannerbutton.png) and then follow the prompts on your device.


## Relationship Assistant

The relationship assistant is designed to deliver the most important and relevant information in relation to what you are doing right now. The assistant works by analyzing all of the data at its disposal and generating a collection of action cards, each of which includes a message summarizing what the card is about, plus a set of links for taking action. The assistant sorts the cards by priority and filters them for your current context.

The assistant reminds you of upcoming activities; it evaluates your communications and suggests when it might be time to reach out to a contact that’s been inactive for a while; it identifies email messages that may be waiting for a reply from you; it alerts you when an opportunity is nearing its close date; and much more.

The assistant draws your attention to your most important items and tasks, drawn from all areas of the app.

- To access the assistant, on the nav bar, select the More button  ![Dynamics 365 apps ellipsis](media/mobile-ellipsis.png "Dynamics 365 apps ellipsis") > **Relationship Assistant**.
