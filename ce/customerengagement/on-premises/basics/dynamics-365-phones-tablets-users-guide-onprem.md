# Use Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets to run Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) apps


Use the Dynamics 365 for phones and Dynamics 365 for tablets mobile app to run Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) apps when you're on the go. With one download from your app store, you’ll automatically have access to all the apps you need for your role. 


> [!NOTE]
> There are separate mobile apps for:
>   - Power Apps mobile: [Run model-driven apps and canvas apps on Power Apps mobile](/powerapps/mobile/run-powerapps-on-mobile)
>   - Dynamics 365 Field Service: [Field Service mobile app](../../../field-service/field-service-mobile-app-user-guide.md)
>   - Finance and Operations applications: [Finance and Operations mobile app](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/mobile-apps/mobile-app-home-page) 

    
## Install the app from your device’s app store  
[!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Install Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets](../../../mobile-app/install-dynamics-365-for-phones-and-tablets.md)    

## Sign in 

Sign in using your web address for the Dynamics 365 app and user name and password. If you need help with your sign-in information, contact your Dynamics 365 administrator. 

1. On the sign-in screen, enter the URL for your web address for the Dynamics 365 app that you use, and then select ![Sign in.](media/signinarrow.png "Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets Preview sign-in"). 
2. Enter your user name and password.
3. From the list of apps that you have access to, select the app that you want to use.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Select an app that you want to use.](media/navwebsignin.png "Select an app to use"). 

### Sign out 

- From the navigation bar, select ![Sign out button.](media/settingsmorebutton.png "Sign out button") > **User Information** > **Sign out**.

  > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
  > ![Sign out.](media/previewsignout.png "Sign out")
  
## Clear cache from the device

If you used the mobile app on a phone or tablet temporarily and want to remove all your cached data before giving the device to someone else, you need to reconfigure the app.

- From the nav bar, select ![Dynamics 365 apps ellipsis.](media/mobile-ellipsis.png "Dynamics 365 apps ellipsis")  > **User Information** > **Reconfigure**. 

     > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
     > ![Reconfigure the mobile app.](media/reconfigure.png "Reconfigure the mobile app")

Reconfiguring deletes data and metadata for the current organization from the cache, however do not rely on this as a security measure.

Make sure you use the **Reconfigure** option before you sign out. If you sign in to another organization but you wanted to delete data for the previous organization that you were logged into, then you will need to sign back into that organization and use the **Reconfigure** option to delete data and metadata for that organization from the cache. 
  
## Navigation

For phones, portrait mode is set as the default screen orientation. For tablets, landscape mode is set as the default. Screen orientation for phone and tablet apps cannot be changed. 

Use the navigation bar to get to your work area, create a new record, search, switch app, and more.

  > ![Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets task flows.](media/TaskBasedFlow.png "Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets task flows")

> [!NOTE]
>  Tasked based flows need to be turned on by your admin. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Create a mobile task flow](../customize/create-mobile-task-flow.md)


## Search for records

You can search for records across multiple entities by using Relevance search or Categorized search. Relevance search delivers fast and comprehensive results across multiple entities, in a single list, sorted by relevance. Categorized search returns search results grouped by entity types, such as accounts, contacts or leads.

Normally, Categorized search is the default search option. However, if Relevance search is enabled by your organization, it becomes the default search experience.   
  
### Normal quick find (Categorized search) 
  
- **Begins with**: Results include records that begin with a specific word. For example, if you want to search for “Alpine Ski House,” type **alp** in the search box; if you type **ski**, the record won’t show up.  
  
- **Wildcard**: For example, *ski or *ski\*  
  
### Relevance search
  
- **Search within**: Results include records that contain a field with all of the words in the search term.  The individual words can appear anywhere in the string and in any order.  For example, if you search for “Alpine Ski House,” you could find results for “I left the house today to go skiing in the Alpine Meadows,” since all of the search words appear somewhere in the string.  

### Switch between Relevance and Categorized search

If your organization has turned on both search options (Relevance and Categorized search), then you can switch between the two.

1. To switch between search types, on the nav bar, select the Search button ![Search button.](media/searchbutton.png).

2. At the top select the drop-down to switch between **Relevance Search** or **Categorized Search**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Switch between search type.](media/switchsearch.png "Switch between search type")

### Start a search  
  
1.  On the nav bar, select the Search button ![Search button.](media/searchbutton.png).
  
2.  Type your search words in the search box and then select Search button.  


### Search using the barcode scanner

Rather than manually typing a barcode number into a field, you can scan barcodes by using your device's camera. This makes it easy to capture info about inventory and other issues when you're out in the field. 

- To use the barcode scanner, when you are in search mode, select the Barcode Scanner button ![Bar code scanner button.](media/barcodescannerbutton.png) and then follow the prompts on your device.


## Relationship Assistant

The relationship assistant is designed to deliver the most important and relevant information in relation to what you are doing right now. The assistant works by analyzing all of the data at its disposal and generating a collection of action cards, each of which includes a message summarizing what the card is about, plus a set of links for taking action. The assistant sorts the cards by priority and filters them for your current context.

The assistant reminds you of upcoming activities; it evaluates your communications and suggests when it might be time to reach out to a contact that’s been inactive for a while; it identifies email messages that may be waiting for a reply from you; it alerts you when an opportunity is nearing its close date; and much more.

The assistant draws your attention to your most important items and tasks, drawn from all areas of the app.

- To access the assistant, on the nav bar, select the More button  ![Dynamics 365 apps ellipsis.](media/mobile-ellipsis.png "Dynamics 365 apps ellipsis") > **Relationship Assistant**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
