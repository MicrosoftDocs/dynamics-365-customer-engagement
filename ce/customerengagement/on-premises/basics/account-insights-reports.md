# Reports for account insights

Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) includes many system reports that you can use to gain insights into how your business is doing.


## Account Distribution report
See which account generates the most revenue for your business. Then use the information to identify patterns – so that you leverage the information and apply it to accounts that are not so doing well.  
  
 This report is generated from revenue based on opportunities that have been won.

## Account Overview report
Get a one-page overview of everything that's happening with an account. The report shows a profile of the account, contact information, and a summary of opportunities and case activities.  
  
- For opportunities, the report shows charts with active opportunities grouped by the probability of the opportunities turning into a sale and the state the opportunities are currently in.  
  
- For support cases, the report shows a chart with closed cases grouped by customer satisfaction level and also by the case status.

## Neglected Accounts report
Use this report to find accounts that haven't been contacted recently so that you can follow up on those accounts.  
  
 When you run the report, select how many days the account has been neglected for. The report shows accounts that have no recent activity, including notes.
