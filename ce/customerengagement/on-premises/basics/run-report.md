Reports help you manage your progress towards your goals by helping you see how you're doing. You can also track trends - which can give you an advantage over your competitors.  
  
For example it's important for a sales team to know which product or service is selling and which is not doing so well. For a customer service team, it's important to track the average time it takes to resolve an issue.  

  
## To run a report  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_reports](../includes/proc-reports.md)]  
  
2. Choose the report you want > **Run Report**.  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   >  In **Report Viewer** dialog box, you can leave the search criteria as is, or change it as needed.
