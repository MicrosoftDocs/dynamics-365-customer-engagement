# Use OneNote in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises)

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-on-premises](../includes/applies-to-on-premises.md)] [Take notes by using OneNote](/powerapps/user/onenote)

If your administrator has set up [!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)] integration with [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)], you can access a [!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)] notebook directly from the activities area in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)]. This doesn't replace the current Notes feature, but gives you another way to access notes stored in [!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)]. When you add a [!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)] section to a notebook, it's shown individually within Customer Engagement (on-premises) and in order of last modified time.

 More information about setting up [!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)] integration if you're a system administrator: [Set up OneNote integration in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises)](../admin/set-up-onenote-integration-in-dynamics-365.md)

>  If you aren't signed in to [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)], you'll go to the [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] sign-in page when you select the title of the [!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)] notebook. When you sign in, you'll go directly to the notebook.  
  
[//]: # (In step 2, I replaced the graphic with the plus sign in parentheses. That's all you need for this button and similarly, for the ellipsis. If you put the graphic back, you'll want to use a different one--icon.png included the tooltip in addition to the icon, and you only need the graphical element here.)
### Get started with OneNote (mobile-optimized app)

1. Open the record you want to open or edit the [!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)] notebook for.  

2. In the **Timeline** section, select **Add info and activities (+)**, and then select **OneNote**.
  
   ![Choose OneNote in the Timeline section](media/onenote-option-in-timeline.png "Choose OneNote in the Timeline section")  
  
   If a notebook is already associated with the record, the notebook opens. Otherwise, a new notebook is created and opened.   
  
   ![Notebook linked to the record is opened](media/open-onenote.png "Notebook linked to the record is opened") 
  
3. The notebook is stored in the associated [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] folder for the record. If there is more than one associated folder, the notebook is created in the first folder.  
  
   ![Notebooks in Document Associated Grid](media/document-associated-grid.png "Notebooks in Document Associated Grid")

### Get started with OneNote (web app)  

1. In the activities area of a record, select **OneNote**.  
  
   ![Choose OneNote on the activity wall](../basics/media/use-onenote.PNG "Choose OneNote on the activity wall")  
  
2. Select a notebook to make entries.  
  
   ![Select a notebook](../basics/media/select-notebook.PNG "Select a notebook")  
 
3. The notebook is stored in the associated [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] folder for the record. If there is more than one associated folder, the notebook is created in the first folder.  
  
   ![Notebooks in associated SharePoint folder](../basics/media/use-onenote.PNG "Notebooks in their associated SharePoint folder")  
  
> [!NOTE]
> - You can't edit the [!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)] file from within Customer Engagement (on-premises). This can be done only from the [!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)] app that opens when you choose the [!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)] link. In the web app, [!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)] is opened in the [!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)] app of [!INCLUDE[pn-ms-office-365](../includes/pn-ms-office-365.md)] in a separate tab.  
> - Don't delete any [!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)] .onetoc2 or .one file types in the **OneNote** section in Customer Engagement (on-premises). If you do, you won't be able to access your Customer Engagement (on-premises) [!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)] notebook.  
> - Section groups that keep related sections together in [!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)] aren't supported in Customer Engagement (on-premises).  
> - You can only rename a section in the desktop version of [!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)]. If you rename a section in [!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)] online, you won't see the updated section name in Customer Engagement (on-premises).
