# Export to an Excel PivotTable

::: moniker range=">= op-9-1"


[!INCLUDE [applies-to-unified-interface](../includes/applies-to-unified-interface.md)] [Export to an Excel PivotTable](/powerapps/user/export-excel-pivottable)

You can export Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) data to a [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Excel_Full](../includes/pn-ms-excel-full.md)] PivotTable to see patterns and trends in data. An [!INCLUDE[pn_Excel_short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)] PivotTable is a great way to summarize, analyze, explore, and present your Customer Engagement (on-premises) data. You can export up to 100,000 records at a time.  
  
## Prerequisites  
  
- On a default Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) installation, before you export data to an [!INCLUDE[pn_Excel_short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)] PivotTable, make sure that your [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_SQL_Server](../includes/pn-ms-sql-server.md)] allows remote connections.  
  
   ### Allow remote connections to SQL Server
  
  1. Start [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_SQL_Management_Studio_long](../includes/pn-ms-sql-management-studio-long.md)].  
  
  2. Connect to the [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_short](../includes/pn-sql-server-short.md)] instance.  
  
  3. Right-click the [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_short](../includes/pn-sql-server-short.md)] instance name, select **Properties**, select **Connections**, and then select the **Allow remote connections to this server** check box.  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Firewall](../includes/pn-windows-firewall.md)] allows remote [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_short](../includes/pn-sql-server-short.md)] connections. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [How to: Configure a Windows Firewall for Database Engine Access](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms175043.aspx).  
  
## Export to an [!INCLUDE[pn_Excel_short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)] PivotTable  
 The option to export data to an [!INCLUDE[pn_Excel_short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)] PivotTable isn't available in all Customer Engagement (on-premises) record types. If you don't see the option, it's not available for that record.  
  
1. Open a list of records. 
  
2. On the command bar, select **Export to Excel** > **Dynamic PivotTable**.  
  
3. In the **Select PivotTable Columns** list, clear the check boxes for the fields as needed, and then select **Export**.  
  
    By default, the **PivotTable Field List** includes only fields that are displayed in the **Select PivotTable Columns** list.  
  
4. Select **Save** and then save the .xlsx file. Make note of the location where you saved the file.  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   >  If you're going to edit the data file later, it's recommended that you save the file before you open it. Otherwise, you may get this error message: **[!INCLUDE[pn_Excel_short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)] cannot open or save any more documents because there is not enough available memory or disk space**.  
   > 
   >  To fix the issue do this:  
   > 
   > 1. Open [!INCLUDE[pn_Excel_short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)] and go to **File** > **Options** > **Trust Center**  
   >    2.  Select **Trust Center Settings**, and then select **Protected View**.  
   >    3.  Under **Protected View**, clear the check boxes for all three items.  
   >    4.  Select **OK**, and then **OK**.  
   > 
   >    We still strongly recommend that you save and then open the data file, rather than disabling protected view, which may put your computer at risk.  
  
5. Open [!INCLUDE[pn_Excel_short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)] and then open the .xlsx file you saved in the previous step.  
  
6. If you see the security warning **External Data Connections have been disabled**, select **Enable Content**.  
  
7. To refresh data in the file, on the **Data** tab select **Refresh from CRM**.  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   >  To view and refresh dynamic data, [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_dynamics_crm_for_outlook](../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-for-outlook.md)] must be installed. If it is already installed and configured, select **Refresh from CRM** to sign in to Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises).  If you do not want to be prompted again to sign in, select **Save my email address and password** in the Sign-In page. 

8. To add a PivotTable, on the **Insert** tab, select **PivotTable**.

    > [!Note]
    > You must complete this step to insert the PivotTable.  The PivotTable is not created automatically.
  
9. Drag the fields from the PivotTable Field List to the PivotTable. For more information, see [!INCLUDE[pn_Excel_short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)] Help.  
  
## Tips  
  
- If you export a list to a dynamic worksheet or PivotTable that you think will be useful to other Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) users, you can add the list as a report, and then share it with others or make it available to all Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) users.  
  
   If the recipients are in the same domain as you, and are Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) users, you can email a dynamic [!INCLUDE[pn_Excel_short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)] file, or store it as a shared file. When recipients open the dynamic file, they will see data they have permission to view in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises), so the data they see may be different from what you see.  
  
- In Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises), money values are exported to [!INCLUDE[pn_Excel_short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)] as numbers. After you have completed the export, to format the data as currency, see the [!INCLUDE[pn_Excel_short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)][!INCLUDE[pn_doc_help_long](../includes/pn-doc-help-long.md)] topic titled "Display numbers as currency."  
  
- The data and time values that you see in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) show up as "Date" only when you export the file to [!INCLUDE[pn_Excel_short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)] but the cell actually shows both the date and time.  
  
- If you're going to make changes and import the data file back in to Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises), remember that secured, calculated, and composite fields (such as Full Name) are read-only and can't be imported in to Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises). You'll be able to edit these fields in Excel but when you import the data back in to Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) these fields won't be updated. If you want to update these fields such as a contact's name, it's recommend that you use that view to export your data, update them in [!INCLUDE[pn_Excel_short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)], and import them back to Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) for changes.  
  
- Some system views, such as Accounts: No Campaign Activities in Last 3 Months, can be exported only to a static [!INCLUDE[pn_Excel_short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)] worksheet.  
  
- Your operating system region settings (in Windows, **Control Panel** > **Region**) and Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) region settings (**Settings** (![Settings button on the nav bar.](../basics/media/settings-gear-icon.png "Settings button on the nav bar")) > **Options** > **Languages**) should be the same. If not, refreshing dynamic data with **Refresh from CRM** might cause data changes.
