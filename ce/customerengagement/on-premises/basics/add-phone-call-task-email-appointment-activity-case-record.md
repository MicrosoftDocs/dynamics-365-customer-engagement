# Add a phone call, task, email, or appointment activity to a record 

::: moniker range=">= op-9-1"

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-unified-interface](../includes/applies-to-unified-interface.md)] [Add an appointment, email, phone call, note, or task activity to the timeline](/powerapps/user/add-activities)

The activity and notes area helps you keep track of all the interactions with your customers. Record all important conversations with the customer or the communication with your team members regarding a record in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises). Add a phone call, task, notes, email, or appointments right within the case, account, contact, lead, or opportunity records without navigating to a different area and opening another form.  
  
All activities that you add from within a record appear in the **Activities** area. If the **Regarding** field of an activity is set, the activity appears in the activity wall of the regarding record. You can filter the list to show just the activities that are in progress or the ones that are overdue. Select the inline **Complete** link to close the activity as **Completed**.  
  
 ![Add activities in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises).](media/add-activities-dynamics-crm.png "Add activities in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises)")  

  
## Add a phone call  
  
1.  Open the record you want to add the activity to.  
  
2.  If you do not see the **Add Phone Call** area open in the middle of the page, select **Activities** > **Add Phone Call**.  
  
3.  In the Description area, provide a summary of the conversation with the customer. You must fill in this area before you can save the phone call.  
  
     The **Call With** field is automatically populated with the customer name you select in the account or contact field. You can select a different contact, account, lead, or user record if required.  
  
4.  By default, the direction is set to **Outgoing**. You can change it to **Incoming** by selecting the **Phone Support** button in the list of case records. To select multiple records, select **Look Up More Records**, and then in the **Look Up Records** dialog box, select the records.  
  
5.  Select the **Left voice mail** check box if you make an outgoing call to a customer and leave a voice mail for them. You can also select this check box if a customer leaves a voice mail message when they call you.  
  
6.  Select **OK** to save the activity.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  By default, every phone call activity that you add in context of a record is marked Completed when the record is saved at least once. If you do not want every phone call activity to be marked Completed by default, you can use the OrgDBOrgSetting MakeSocialPanePhoneCallCompleted and set it to **false**.  [Learn more about OrgDBOrgSettings](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2691237/orgdborgsettings-tool-for-microsoft-dynamics-crm). 
> 
>  However, if you add a phone call activity to an unsaved record, or if you create a new activity and then set the **Regarding** field of the activity to another entity record, the activity is set to an Open state. You can select the **Complete** link to close the activity as **Completed**. The **Complete** link is available only after you save the case record at least once.

## Add notes  
 You can also easily add notes in the activities area.

 This doesn't replace the current Notes feature, but gives you another way to access notes stored in OneNote.
