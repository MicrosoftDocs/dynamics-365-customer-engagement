# Deactivate or activate an account or contact

::: moniker range=">= op-9-1"

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-unified-interface](../includes/applies-to-unified-interface.md)]  [Deactivate or activate an account or contact](/powerapps/user/deactivate-activate-account-contact)

In Customer Engagement (on-premises), you deactivate an account or contact rather than deleting it. This ensures the integrity of the audit trail associated with that record.  
  
When a deactivated account or contact becomes inactive, it can still be used to establish new relationships with other records. All relationships created with the deactivated item are still available.
  
 Deactivated accounts can subsequently be reactivated should the need arise.  
  
## Deactivate an account or contact  
  
1.  Go to Sales > **Accounts** or **Contacts**. 
  
2.  Select the active account or contact that you want to deactivate, select **Deactivate**, and then confirm the deactivation.  
  
## Activate an account or contact  
  
1.  Go to Sales > **Accounts** or **Contacts**.
  
2.  To view a deactivated account or contact, in the **System Views** list, select **Inactive Accounts** or **Inactive Contacts**.  
  
3.  Select the inactive accounts or contacts you want to activate, select **Activate**, and then confirm the activation.
