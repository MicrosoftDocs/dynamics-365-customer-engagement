# Where to find your business apps

::: moniker range=">= op-9-1"


Business apps are available to users based on their security roles. If your system administrator has created any new apps, they will be visible to you if your security role has been given access to those apps. When you use an app, you'll see only those entities in the site map and other places in the app that your system administrator has added while designing the app. 

The Apps page shows all published apps based on your organization's licensing options, and your security role. The Apps page has two views: 

- **Published Apps**: All published apps that are available.
- **Apps Being Edited**: All draft apps that are available.   

If you are a system administrator, a customizer, or a user with equivalent privileges, you'll see published apps and apps that are in draft state.  

With Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises), version 9.1 your system administrator has the option to enabled the new Unified Interface for your apps. For more information, see [About Unified Interface in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises)](../admin/about-unified-interface.md).

The easiest way to tell whether you're on Unified Interface or the legacy web client is to look at the site map. In Unified Interface the site map is on the left.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Unified interface for on-prim.](media/uci-onprem-interface.png "Unified interface for on-prem")


The site map for the legacy web client is at the top.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Web client interface.](media/web-client-interface.png "Web client interface")


## Find apps in Unified Interface

Use the app-selector menu to switch between apps.

1. Sign in to Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises).  
2. Select the current app name.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Select the current app name.](media/access-site-map.png "Select the current app name")

3. On the **Apps** page select an app. You will only see apps for your organization.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Select an app to use.](media/access-site-map-1.png "Select an app to use")

## Find apps in the legacy web client

1. Sign in to Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises).  
  
2. Go to **Settings** > **Apps**.  
  
    You can also directly open the My Apps page by entering the following URL in your browser:  https://\<server name>/\<orgName>/apps.  
  
3. In the **Published Apps** view, select the app that you want to use.  
  
  
> [!NOTE]
> - The Quick Create menu, Global Search, and Recent Records within the app aren't filtered. These show and can be searched on all entities instead of only the entities that are added to the app.  
>   -   When you search using Advanced Find, it searches all entities and not just the entities added to the app.
