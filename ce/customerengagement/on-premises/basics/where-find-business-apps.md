# Where to find your business apps

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-on-premises](../includes/applies-to-on-premises.md)] [Use model-driven apps in Power Apps](/powerapps/user/use-model-driven-apps)

Business apps are available to users based on their security roles. If your system administrator has created any new apps, they will be visible to you if your security role has been given access to those apps. 
  
1. Sign in to Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises).  
  
2. Go to **Settings** > **My Apps**.  
  
    The page shows all published Customer Engagement (on-premises) based on your organization's licensing options, and your security role.  
  
    You can also directly open the My Apps page by entering the following URL in your browser:  https://\<server name>/\<orgName>/apps.  
  
    The My Apps page has two views: Published Apps and Apps Being Edited. All draft apps are available in the **Apps Being Edited** view. All published apps are available in the **Published Apps** view.  
  
3. In the **Published Apps** view, click the app that you want to use.  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   >  If you are a system administrator, a customizer or a user with equivalent privileges, you'll see apps in published as well as draft states.  
  
When you use an app, you'll see only those entities in the site map  and other places in the app that your system administrator has added while designing the app.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> - The Quick Create menu, Global Search, and Recent Records within the app aren't filtered. These show and can be searched on all entities instead of only the entities that are added to the app.  
>   -   When you search using Advanced Find, it searches all entities and not just the entities added to the app.
