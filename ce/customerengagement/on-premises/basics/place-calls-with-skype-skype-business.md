# Place calls with Skype or Skype for Business

If your organization is set up to use [!INCLUDE[pn_skype](../includes/pn-skype.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_skype_for_business](../includes/pn-skype-for-business.md)], you can select a phone number to call your contacts from within Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises). This capability is called "click to call."  
  
> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[cc_lync_rebranded_skype_for_business](../includes/cc-lync-rebranded-skype-for-business.md)]  
  
 To place calls from within Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) on your computer, you either need to [install Skype](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=246141); or you need to check with your system administrator for steps to install [!INCLUDE[pn_skype_for_business](../includes/pn-skype-for-business.md)].  
  
 To place calls from within [!INCLUDE[pn_moca_short](../includes/pn-moca-short.md)], you'll need to download the [!INCLUDE[pn_skype](../includes/pn-skype.md)] app. If you don't already have the app when you tap a phone number, you'll have the opportunity to download the app before the call is placed.  
  
 These versions of [!INCLUDE[pn_Lync_Short](../includes/pn-lync-short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_skype](../includes/pn-skype.md)] are supported:  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_lync_2010](../includes/pn-microsoft-lync-2010.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_lync_2013](../includes/pn-microsoft-lync-2013.md)]  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_skype_60](../includes/pn-skype-60.md)]
