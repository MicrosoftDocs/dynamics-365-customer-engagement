You can enable or disable them for SLA-enabled entity records in your organization. For example, you might want to disable SLAs during maintenance activities or when you're importing records and you don't want the SLAs to apply to the records. To disable, select **Yes**. To enable, select **No**. **Note:**  When SLAs are disabled, SLA records can still be created or modified. SLAs wonâ€™t be applied to  records, however.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Automatically apply SLA on entity record update after SLA was manually applied **Important:** This feature is only available if you've updated to CRM 2016. Interested in getting this feature? [Find your administrator or support person](../basics/find-administrator-support.md). |                                                                                                                                                                             This setting determines if an SLA should automatically be applied to a  record when an SLA is manually selected in the record's SLA field. The automatic SLA application can either be through the entitlement applied to the case (for theCase entity) or with the default SLA.<br /><br /> Either way, the manual SLA takes precedence over any other way of SLA application.<br /><br /> When set to **No**, SLAs wonâ€™t be applied automatically to records after an SLA is manually applied. **Note:**  For Case entity records, when both entitlement and customer, and manual SLA are changing, the manual SLA is used regardless of this setting.                                                                                                                                                                              |

Double-click the statuses in the **Available Values** column. When the user sets a record to one of the pause status values you set here, Customer Engagement (on-premises) pauses the SLA calculation. When the user changes the status of the case back to a status other than a pause status, Customer Engagement (on-premises) updates the failure and warning time in the enhanced SLA  KPIs. It also tracks the total time for which a  record is in the pause status. **Important:**  This feature of enabling other entities for SLA was  introduced in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_8_1_0_online_subsequent](../includes/pn-crm-8-1-0-online-subsequent.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_8_1_0_op_subsequent](../includes/pn-crm-8-1-0-op-subsequent.md)].
