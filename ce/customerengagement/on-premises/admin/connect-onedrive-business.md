# Enable OneDrive for Business in Customer Engagement apps

Users can create and manage private documents with [!INCLUDE[pn_onedrive_for_business](../includes/pn-onedrive-for-business.md)]. Those documents can be accessed within [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] apps after the system administrator has enabled [!INCLUDE[pn_onedrive_for_business](../includes/pn-onedrive-for-business.md)].  
  
## Requirements  
 The following are required to use [!INCLUDE[pn_onedrive_for_business](../includes/pn-onedrive-for-business.md)] with [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_dynamics_crm_2016_server](../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-2016-server.md)].  
  
> [!NOTE]

> This topic applies to organizations deploying on-premises versions of [!INCLUDE[pn_onedrive_for_business](../includes/pn-onedrive-for-business.md)] and [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] apps or an online/on-premises mix of these products.   

- [Set up SharePoint integration with Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement](/power-platform/admin/set-up-sharepoint-integration) and have at least one team site.  
  
- Set up permission on the root [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] team site for all users who will use [!INCLUDE[pn_onedrive_for_business](../includes/pn-onedrive-for-business.md)] in [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] apps. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Plan sites and manage users](https://support.office.com/article/Plan-sites-and-manage-users-95F9EB7A-4AC8-4DD5-A883-17686CBF8FFF)  
  
- For SharePoint on-premises, enable the Search service to access shared documents from other users. It is enabled by default on [!INCLUDE[pn_sharepoint_online](../includes/pn-sharepoint-online.md)] but not on [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] on-premises.

## Enable OneDrive for Business  
 You enable [!INCLUDE[pn_onedrive_for_business](../includes/pn-onedrive-for-business.md)] as follows:  
  
1. Click **Settings** > **Document Management** > **Enable OneDrive for Business**  
  
2. Click **Enable OneDrive for Business** to enable it, and then click **OK**.  
  
   **If youâ€™re running [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_Server_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-server-short.md)] on-premises**, on the Windows Server where [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_Server_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-server-short.md)] is running, open the [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] Management Shell and run the following commands to set up permissions between [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_dynamics_crm_2016_server](../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-2016-server.md)].  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You might have already set up permissions and can skip the following if you completed the steps in [Configure server-based authentication with Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps Online and SharePoint on-premises](/power-platform/admin/configure-server-based-authentication-sharepoint-on-premises).  
  
```  
Add-Pssnapin *  
# Access WellKnown App principal  
[Microsoft.SharePoint.Administration.SPWebService]::ContentService.WellKnownAppPrincipals  
  
# Create WellKnown App principal  
$ClientId = "00000007-0000-0000-c000-000000000000"  
$PermissionXml = "<AppPermissionRequests AllowAppOnlyPolicy=""true""><AppPermissionRequest Scope=""https://sharepoint/content/tenant"" Right=""FullControl"" /><AppPermissionRequest Scope=""https://sharepoint/social/tenant"" Right=""Read"" /><AppPermissionRequest Scope=""https://sharepoint/search"" Right=""QueryAsUserIgnoreAppPrincipal"" /></AppPermissionRequests>"  
  
$wellKnownApp= New-Object -TypeName "Microsoft.SharePoint.Administration.SPWellKnownAppPrincipal" -ArgumentList ($ClientId, $PermissionXml)  
  
$wellKnownApp.Update()  
  
```  
  
## Controlling access to OneDrive for Business in Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps 
 You can toggle availability of [!INCLUDE[pn_onedrive](../includes/pn-onedrive.md)] in [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] apps for end users through the **OneDrive for Business** privilege.  
  
1. Click **Settings** > **Security** > **Security Roles**  
  
2. Choose a security role, and then click the **Core Records** tab.
