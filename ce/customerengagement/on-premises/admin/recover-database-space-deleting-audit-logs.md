When you enable auditing, Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) stores the change history for transactions in the form of audit logs in the database. You can delete old and unwanted logs to clean up your database space.  
  
> [!CAUTION]
>  When you delete an audit log, you can no longer view the audit history for the period covered by that audit log.
