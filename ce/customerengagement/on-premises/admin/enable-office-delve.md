# About Office Delve/Graph

*This content also applies to the on-premises version.*

Office Graph integration for Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps will be removed on August 31, 2017, at the same time that [Office ends GQL query support](/graph/api/resources/social-overview). Customers can continue to use Office Graph integration through August 31, 2017. After August 31 that date, the Office Graph trending documents component will cease to function and you’ll see the following error message:

**We can't get to the trending documents. Try again later.**

To disable Office Graph:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Document Management** > **Office Graph Integration**.
2. Remove the Trending Documents dashboard component from existing dashboards.

For more information, see the blog: [Office Graph integration removal](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/crm/2017/07/31/office-graph-integration-removal/).
