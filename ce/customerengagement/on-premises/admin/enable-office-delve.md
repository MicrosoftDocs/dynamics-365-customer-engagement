Office Graph integration for Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps will be removed on August 31, 2017, at the same time that [Office ends GQL query support](/graph/api/resources/social-overview). Customers can continue to use Office Graph integration through August 31, 2017. After August 31 that date, the Office Graph trending documents component will cease to function and youâ€™ll see the following error message:

**We can't get to the trending documents. Try again later.**

To disable Office Graph:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Document Management** > **Office Graph Integration**.
2. Remove the Trending Documents dashboard component from existing dashboards.
