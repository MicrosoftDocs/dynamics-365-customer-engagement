## Using Skype for Business with Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps 

 When you use [!INCLUDE[pn_skype_for_business](../includes/pn-skype-for-business.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps together, you can use [!INCLUDE[pn_skype_for_business](../includes/pn-skype-for-business.md)] presence and click-to-call from within [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps.  
  
### Requirements and Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps configuration  

- Your organization must have a Skype for Business Online license.
  
- To use click-to-call, [!INCLUDE[pn_skype_for_business](../includes/pn-skype-for-business.md)] must be selected as the telephony provider in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps. You can set this on the General tab at Settings > Administration > System Settings.  
  
- By default, [!INCLUDE[pn_skype_for_business](../includes/pn-skype-for-business.md)] presence is enabled in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps. System administrators can enable or disable presence in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps. To do this, click **Settings** > **Administration** > **System Settings** and on the **General** tab, **Set the IM presence option** to **Yes** or **No**.  
  
- Each user must have the [!INCLUDE[pn_skype_for_business](../includes/pn-skype-for-business.md)] client installed and running on their PC.  
  
- For [!INCLUDE[pn_skype_for_business](../includes/pn-skype-for-business.md)] presence, [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] apps users must have `https://*.dynamics.com` added to their web browsers trusted sites list in Internet options in [!INCLUDE[pn_Internet_Explorer](../includes/pn-internet-explorer.md)].
