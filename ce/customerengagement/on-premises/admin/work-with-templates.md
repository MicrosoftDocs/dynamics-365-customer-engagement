# Use templates to improve consistency and speed

You can use templates in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) in a variety of ways to speed your work and improve consistency.

## Article templates

Article templates help you create new articles for your organization's knowledge base library. You can also create templates with boilerplate text to help article writers use consistent language and messaging.

More information: [Create templates for articles](/power-platform/admin/create-templates-articles) in the Power Platform admin documentation

## Knowledge article templates

Knowledge article templates help knowledge authors by simplifying the process of creating knowledge articles. Templates also help knowledge managers and authors in maintaining consistency in branding, language, and structure.

More information: [Create knowledge article template](../../../customer-service/use/create-templates-knowledge-article.md) in Dynamics 365 Customer Service documentation

## Email templates

Save time when creating multiple email messages by making email templates. Email templates contain pre-filled data that you specify, so you don't have to re-enter the same information for each article.

More information: [Create templates for email](/power-platform/admin/create-templates-email) in the Power Platform admin documentation.

## Mail merge templates

You can use mail merge templates with Office Word to create customer-ready letters, faxes, e-mail messages, and quotes.

More information: [Work with mail merge templates](/power-platform/admin/work-mail-merge-templates) in the Power Platform admin documentation

## Campaign templates

Save time when creating multiple campaigns by creating a campaign template. Campaign templates contain pre-filled data that you specify, so you don't have to reenter the same information for each campaign. You can either create a new campaign template or copy an existing campaign to use as a template.  
  
### Create a campaign template  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_marketing_campaigns](../includes/proc-marketing-campaigns.md)]  
  
2. Click **New Template**.  
  
    \- OR -  
  
    Open the campaign you want to edit.  
  
3. Add information in the template form just as you do when creating a campaign. In the template form, enter the information you want to appear in campaigns based on this template, and add items such as planning tasks, campaign activities, and marketing lists.  
  
4. Click **Save** or **Save and Close**.  
  
### Copy an existing campaign as a template  
  
- Open the campaign that you want to copy. Click **Copy as Template**, type a name for the template, and click **Save**.  
  
  If you need to back up your templates, or use them in a different implementation of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps, you can export them as part of exporting customizations. More information: [Export your customizations as a solution](../customize/use-solutions-for-your-customizations.md)  
  
> [!NOTE]
> This section applies to the Marketing work area under Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premise). If you use Dynamics 365 Marketing, which provides a full-scale set of functionality, automation, and analytical insights for multistage and multichannel campaigns, see [Marketing help and training](../../../marketing/help-hub.yml).

## Entitlement templates

Quickly create other entitlements pre-filled with the basic information like the start and end date, service level agreement (SLA), allocation type, and total term by using an entitlement template in Customer Engagement.

More information: [Use entitlement templates to set up entitlements quickly](../../../customer-service/administer/set-up-entitlements-templates.md) in the Dynamics 365 Customer Service documentation.

## Excel templates

Excel provides powerful ways to analyze and present your Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement data. With Excel templates, you can easily create and share your customized analysis with others in your organization.

More information: [Analyze and share your data with Excel templates](/power-platform/admin/analyze-your-data-with-excel-templates) in the Power Platform admin documentation

## Word templates

After you create and import Office Word templates into Customer Engagement, with one click users can generate standardized documents automatically populated with Customer Engagement data.

More information: [Use Word templates to create standardized documents](/power-platform/admin/using-word-templates-dynamics-365) in the Power Platform admin documentation.
