# Connect Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps (online) to Exchange Online 

::: moniker range="op-9-1"
[!INCLUDE [cc-use-advanced-settings](../includes/cc-use-advanced-settings.md)]
::: moniker-end

With both [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] apps and [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Exchange_Online](../includes/pn-microsoft-exchange-online.md)] hosted as online services, connecting the two is a simpler, more straightforward configuration.  
  
> [!TIP]
> ![Video symbol](../admin/media/video-thumbnail-4.png "Video symbol") Check out the following video: [Connect Dynamics 365 (online) to Exchange Online using server-side sync](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=836831).

## Get Exchange ready  
 To use [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange_Online](../includes/pn-exchange-online.md)] with Customer Engagement apps, you must have an [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange_Online](../includes/pn-exchange-online.md)] subscription that comes as part of an [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] subscription or that can be subscribed to separately. For information on [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange_Online](../includes/pn-exchange-online.md)], see:  
  
-   [Exchange Online](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj200580\(v=exchg.150\).aspx)

> [!TIP]
>  To make sure youâ€™ve got a good connection to [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange_Online](../includes/pn-exchange-online.md)], run the [Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer](https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/). For information on what tests to run, see [Test mail flow with the Remote Connectivity Analyzer](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn305950\(v=exchg.150\).aspx).  
  
<a name="BKMK_VerifyProfile"></a>   

## Verify you have the profile: Microsoft Exchange Online  
 If you have an [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange_Online](../includes/pn-exchange-online.md)] subscription in the same tenant as your Customer Engagement apps subscription, Customer Engagement apps creates a default profile for the email connection: **Microsoft Exchange Online**. To verify this profile:  
  
1. Go to **Settings** > **Email Configuration** > **Email Server Profiles**.  
  
2. Select **Active Email Server Profiles** and check that the **Microsoft Exchange Online** profile is in the list.  
  
   ![Verify the Microsoft Exchange Online profile.](../admin/media/exchange-online-profile.png "Verify the Microsoft Exchange Online profile")  
  
    If the [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Exchange_Online](../includes/pn-microsoft-exchange-online.md)] profile is missing, verify you have an [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange_Online](../includes/pn-exchange-online.md)] subscription and that it exists in the same tenant as your Customer Engagement apps subscription.  
  
3. If there are multiple profiles, select the **Microsoft Exchange Online** profile and set it as default.  
  
<a name="BKMK_ConfigureDefault"></a>   

## Configure default email processing and synchronization  
 Set server-side synchronization to be the default configuration method for newly created users.  
  
1. Go to **Settings** > **Email Configuration** > **Email Configuration Settings**.  
  
2. Set the processing and synchronization fields as follows:  
  
   - **Server Profile**: [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Exchange_Online](../includes/pn-microsoft-exchange-online.md)]  
  
   - **Incoming Email**: Server-Side Synchronization or Email Router  
  
   - **Outgoing Email**: Server-Side Synchronization or Email Router  
  
   - **Appointments, Contacts, and Tasks**: Server-Side Synchronization or Email Router  
  
   ![System Settings for server-side synchronization.](../admin/media/exchange-online-sss-settings.png "System Settings for server-side synchronization")  
  
3. Select **OK**.  
  
All new users will have these settings applied to their mailbox.  
  
<a name="BKMK_ConfigureMailboxes"></a>   

## Configure mailboxes  
 New users will have their mailboxes configured automatically with the settings you made in the prior section. For existing users added prior to the above settings, you must set the Server Profile and the delivery method for email, appointments, contacts, and tasks.  
  
 In addition to administrator permissions, you must have Read and Write privileges on the Mailbox entity to set the delivery method for the mailbox.  
  
 Choose **one** of the following methods:  
  
### Set mailboxes to the default profile  
  
1. Go to **Settings** > **Email Configuration** > **Mailboxes**.  
  
2. Choose **Active Mailboxes**.  
  
3. Select all the mailboxes that you want to associate with the [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Exchange_Online](../includes/pn-microsoft-exchange-online.md)] profile, select **Apply Default Email Settings**, verify the settings, and then select **OK**.  
  
   ![Apply default email settings.](../admin/media/apply-default-email-settings.png "Apply default email settings")  
  
    By default, the mailbox configuration is tested and the mailboxes are enabled when you select **OK**.  
  
### Edit mailboxes to set the profile and delivery methods  
  
1.  Go to **Settings** > **Email Configuration** > **Mailboxes**.  
  
2.  Select **Active Mailboxes**.  
  
3.  Select the mailboxes that you want to configure, and then select **Edit**.  
  
4.  In the **Change Multiple Records** form, under **Synchronization Method**, set **Server Profile** to **Microsoft Exchange Online**.  
  
5.  Set **Incoming** and **Outgoing** **Email** to **Server-Side Synchronization or Email Router**.  
  
6.  Set **Appointments, Contacts, and Tasks** to **Server-Side Synchronization**.  
  
7.  Select **Change**.

## Approve email  

You only need to approve the email address for a user when their email address has changed in Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement.

To approve emails for Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps, a Dynamics 365 user requires:

1. The **Approve Email Addresses for Users or Queues** privilege. 
2. The permissions as described in the table below.

### Require admin approval?

Decide which approach you want your organization to follow for mailbox approval.

![Decide on mailbox approval approach.](media/approval-flow-chart.png "Decide on mailbox approval approach")

### Permission model
The following table describes the permissions required to approve emails.

**Terminology**
- **Yes**: can approve email
- **No**: cannot approve email
- **n/a**: not applicable

> [!NOTE]
> This permission model is being gradually rolled out and will be available once it is deployed to your region. Check the version number provided below for when the change will be provided.

<sup>1</sup> We recommend you include your Exchange admin in custom business processes your organization follows for this configuration. <br />
<sup>2</sup> We are updating for Customer Engagement Online/Exchange Online, for Customer Engagement version 9.1.0.5805 or later.  <br />
<sup>3</sup> We will be updating for Customer Engagement Online/Exchange On-premises. Check back for version information.

 To determine your version, sign in to Customer Engagement apps, and in the upper-right corner of the screen, select the **Settings** button (![User profile Settings button.](media/user-profile-settings-button.gif)) > **About**.  

### Require and configure mailbox approval 

Follow these steps to approve email addresses for users and queues. By default, admins, as described in the Permission model table, are required to approve emails.

#### Add Approve Email Addresses for Users or Queues privilege

To approve emails for Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps, a Dynamics user requires the **Approve Email Addresses for Users or Queues** privilege.  A system admin can assign the **Approve Email Addresses for Users or Queues** privilege to any security role and assign the security role to any user. 

To manually assign the **Approve Email Addresses for Users or Queues** privilege to a security role: 
1. In Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement, go to **Settings** > **Security** > **Security Roles**. 
2. Select a security role, and then select the **Business Management** tab. 
3. Under **Miscellaneous Privileges**, set the privilege level for **Approve Email Addresses for Users or Queues**.
  
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Approve Email Address for User or Queues.](media/approve-email-address-for-user-queues.png "Approve Email Address for User or Queues")

#### Approve mailboxes

1. Go to **Settings** > **Email Configuration** > **Mailboxes**.  
  
2. Select **Active Mailboxes**.  
  
3. Select the mailboxes that you want to approve, and then select **More Commands** (**â€¦**) > **Approve Email**.  
  
4. Select **OK**.  

### Remove requirement to approve mailboxes

Admins, as described in the Permission model table, can change the settings so mailbox approval is not required.

1. Go to **Settings** > **Administration** > **System Settings** > **Email tab**. 

2. Under **Email processing for unapproved user and queues**, uncheck **Process emails only for approved users** and **Process emails only for approved queues**. These settings are enabled by default.

3. Select **OK**.

   > ![Email processing for unapproved user and queues.](media/email-processing-for-unapproved.png "Email processing for unapproved user and queues")   

<a name="BKMK_TestConfiguration"></a>   

## Test configuration of mailboxes  
  
1. Go to **Settings** > **Email Configuration** > **Mailboxes**.  
  
2. Select **Active Mailboxes**.  
  
3. Select the mailboxes you want to test, and then select **Test & Enable Mailbox**.  

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Test and enable mailboxes.](media/test-enable-mailbox85.png "Test and enable mailboxes")
  
   This tests the incoming and outgoing email configuration of the selected mailboxes and enables them for email processing. If an error occurs in a mailbox, an alert is shown on the Alerts wall of the mailbox and the profile owner. Depending on the nature of the error, [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps tries to process the email again after some time or disables the mailbox for email processing.  
  
   To see alerts for an individual mailbox, open the mailbox and then under **Common**, select **Alerts**.  
  
   The result of the email configuration test is displayed in the **Incoming Email Status**, **Outgoing Email Status**, and **Appointments, Contacts, and Tasks Status** fields of a mailbox record. An alert is also generated when the configuration is successfully completed for a mailbox. This alert is shown to the mailbox owner.

> [!TIP]
>  If youâ€™re unable to synchronize contacts, appointments, and tasks for a mailbox, you may want to select the **Sync items with Exchange from this Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps org only, even if Exchange was set to sync with a different org** check box. [Read more about this check box](when-would-want-use-check-box.md).

## Test email configuration for all mailboxes associated with an email server profile  
  
1. Go to **Settings** > **Email Configuration** > **Email Server Profiles**.  
  
2. Select the [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Exchange_Online](../includes/pn-microsoft-exchange-online.md)] profile, and then select **Test & Enable Mailboxes**.  
  
    When you test the email configuration, an asynchronous job runs in the background. It may take a few minutes for the test to be completed. [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps tests the email configuration of all the mailboxes associated with the [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Exchange_Online](../includes/pn-microsoft-exchange-online.md)] profile. For the mailboxes configured with server-side synchronization for synchronizing appointments, tasks, and contacts, it also checks to make sure theyâ€™re configured properly.  
  
> [!TIP]
>  If youâ€™re unable to synchronize contacts, appointments, and tasks for a mailbox, you may want to select the **Sync items with Exchange from this Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps org only, even if Exchange was set to sync with a different org** check box.
