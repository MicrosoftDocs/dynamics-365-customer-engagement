# Software requirements for SharePoint document management

If you want to use [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_SharePoint_long](../includes/pn-ms-sharepoint-long.md)] document management functionality with Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises), you must meet the requirements listed here:  

- To use server-based integration with SharePoint, you can use Microsoft SharePoint Online or Microsoft SharePoint 2013 SP1 on-premises (or a later version).

     > [!IMPORTANT]
     > SharePoint Foundation versions aren’t supported for use with Customer Engagement (on-premises) document management.

<br />

- A SharePoint site collection. You also need at least one site collection configured and available for Customer Engagement (on-premises).
- Server-based SharePoint integration must be enabled. More information: [Manage your documents using SharePoint](manage-documents-using-sharepoint.md)
- Users who access SharePoint from Customer Engagement (on-premises) must have appropriate permissions on the SharePoint site collection where the document management components are installed. For more information about how to grant membership on a site collection, see the SharePoint Help.

## About server-based SharePoint integration

 Earlier versions of Customer Engagement (on-premises) document management use a client-to-server strategy to authenticate and transmit data from Customer Engagement (on-premises) to [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)]. Server-based (using server-to-server authentication) [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration provides the following benefits:  

- User interface that is consistent with the newly-updated Customer Engagement (on-premises) user interface.  

- Users can create and view folders when using document management within Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps.

- To configure and use document management, you do not need to be signed in to both Customer Engagement (on-premises) and [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)].

## Dynamics CRM List Component for SharePoint  
 The [!INCLUDE[pn_list_component_short](../includes/pn-list-component-short.md)] makes Customer Engagement (on-premises) documents that are stored on [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] available to you in a format that has the look and feel of Customer Engagement (on-premises). This feature also lets Customer Engagement (on-premises) automatically create folders that will be used to store documents related to Customer Engagement (on-premises) records on [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)].  

 The [!INCLUDE[pn_list_component_short](../includes/pn-list-component-short.md)] has the following benefits:  

- Users can create and view folders when using document management within Customer Engagement (on-premises).  

- Users can create [custom content types](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=396378) such as a Sales Contract content type.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Notice that the [!INCLUDE[pn_list_component_short](../includes/pn-list-component-short.md)] isn’t required when you use server-based integration with [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)]. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Server-based SharePoint integration](../admin/sharepoint-document-management-software-requirements.md#BKMK_enable_servertoserver)  
> - Cient-to-server authentication strategies that require [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] server sandboxing, like those used with the [!INCLUDE[pn_list_component_short](../includes/pn-list-component-short.md)],  may be deprecated soon.
