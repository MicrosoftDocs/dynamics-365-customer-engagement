# Create or edit a security role to manage access

::: moniker range="op-9-1"
[!INCLUDE [cc-use-advanced-settings](../includes/cc-use-advanced-settings.md)]
::: moniker-end

You can create new security roles to accommodate changes in your business requirements or you can edit the privileges associated with an existing security role.
  
 If you need to back up your security role changes, or export security roles for use in a different implementation of Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises), you can export them as part of exporting customizations. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Export your customizations as a solution](../customize/use-solutions-for-your-customizations.md)  
  
## Create a security role  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_permissions_system_admin_and_customizer](../includes/proc-permissions-system-admin-and-customizer.md)]  
  
    Check your security role  
  
   - [!INCLUDE[proc_check_your_security_role](../includes/proc-check-your-security-role.md)]  
  
   - [!INCLUDE[proc_dont_have_correct_permissions](../includes/proc-dont-have-correct-permissions.md)]  
  
2. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_security](../includes/proc-settings-security.md)]  
  
3. Click **Security Roles**.  
  
4. On the Actions toolbar, click **New**.  
  
5. Set the privileges on each tab.  
  
    To change the access level for a privilege, click the symbol until you see the symbol you want. The possible access levels depend on whether the record type is organization-owned or user-owned.  
  
   > [!TIP]
   >  To cycle through the access levels, you can also click the privilege column heading, or click the record type multiple times.  
   >  There are a set of minimum privileges that are required in order for the new security role to be used - see below Minimum Privileges for common tasks.
  
6. When you have finished configuring the security role, on the toolbar, click or tap **Save and Close**.  
  
## Create a security role by Copy Role

1. [!INCLUDE[proc_permissions_system_admin_and_customizer](../includes/proc-permissions-system-admin-and-customizer.md)]  
  
    Check your security role  
  
   - [!INCLUDE[proc_check_your_security_role](../includes/proc-check-your-security-role.md)]  
  
   - [!INCLUDE[proc_dont_have_correct_permissions](../includes/proc-dont-have-correct-permissions.md)]  
  
2. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_security](../includes/proc-settings-security.md)]

## Edit a security role  
 Before you edit an existing security role, make sure that you understand the principles of data access. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Controlling Data Access](../admin/security-roles-privileges.md)  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You canâ€™t edit the System Administrator security role. To create a security role similar to the System Administrator security role, copy the System Administrator security role, and make changes to the new role.  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_permissions_system_admin_and_customizer](../includes/proc-permissions-system-admin-and-customizer.md)]  
  
    Check your security role  
  
   - [!INCLUDE[proc_check_your_security_role](../includes/proc-check-your-security-role.md)]  
  
   - [!INCLUDE[proc_dont_have_correct_permissions](../includes/proc-dont-have-correct-permissions.md)]  
  
2. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_security](../includes/proc-settings-security.md)]  
  
3. Click **Security Roles**.  
  
4. In the list of security roles, double-click or tap a name to open the page associated with that security role.  
  
5. Set the privileges on each tab.  
  
    To change the access level for a privilege, click the symbol until you see the symbol you want. The possible access levels depend on whether the record type is organization-owned or user-owned.  
  
   > [!TIP]
   >  To cycle through the access levels, you can also click the privilege column heading, or click the record type multiple times.  
   >  There are a set of minimum privileges that are required in order for the new security role to be used - see below Minimum Privileges for common tasks. 
    
6. When you have finished configuring the security role, on the toolbar, click or tap **Save and Close**.  
  
## Minimum privileges for common tasks  
 It's helpful to keep in mind the minimum privileges that are needed for some common tasks. This means that a user is required to have a security role with these privileges in order to run applications. 
 
 We've created a solution you can import that provides a security role with the required minimum privileges.

Start by downloading the solution from the Download Center: [Dataverse minimum privilege security role](https://download.microsoft.com/download/6/5/5/6552A30E-05F4-45F0-AEE3-9BB01E13118A/MinprivilegeSecRole_1_0_0_2.zip).

Then, follow the directions to import the solution: [Import, update, and export solutions](../customize/import-update-upgrade-solution.md).

When you import the solution, it creates the **min prv apps use** role which you can copy (see: [Create a security role by Copy Role](#create-a-security-role-by-copy-role)). When Copying Role is complete, navigate to each tab - Core Records, Business Management, Customization, etc - and set the appropriate privileges. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should try out the solution in a development environment before importing into a production environment. 
  
- When logging in to Customer Engagement (on-premises):  
  
  -   Assign the min prv apps use security role or a copy of this security role to your user.
  
  -   To render an entity grid (that is, to view lists of records and other data), assign the following privileges on the Core Records tab: Read privilege on the entity, Read Saved View, Create/Read/Write User Entity UI Settings
      and assign the following privilege on the Business Management tab: Read User   

- When logging in to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)]:

   - To render navigation for Customer Engagement (on-premises) and all Customer Engagement (on-premises) buttons: assign the min prv apps use security role or a copy of this security role to your user   
  
  - To render an entity grid: assign Read privilege on the entity  
  
  - To render entities: assign Read privilege on the entity
