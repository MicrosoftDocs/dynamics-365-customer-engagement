To accommodate changes in sales territories or the representatives that are assigned to each territory, you can add or remove territory members in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises).  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_bus_management](../includes/proc-settings-bus-management.md)]  
  
2. Choose **Sales Territories**.  
  
3. In the list of territories, under **Territory Name**, double-click or tap the entry for the territory you want to add people to or remove people from.  
  
4. In the Navigation Pane, expand **Common** if necessary, and then choose **Members**.  
  
5. Follow the steps for the task you’re performing:  
  
   **Add people to a sales territory**  
  
   1.  On the ribbon, choose **Add Members**, view the text in the **Message from webpage** dialog box, and then choose **OK** to close the dialog box.  
  
   2.  In the **Look Up Records** dialog box, in the **Search** text box, type in the name or a part of the name of the user you want to add to the sales territory, and then choose the **Start search** icon ![54934](../admin/media/search-button.png "54934").  
  
   3.  In the list of records, select the people you want to add to the sales territory, and then tap or click **Add**.  
  
   **Remove people from a sales territory**  
  
   1.  In the list of members, select the people you want to remove from the sales territory, and then on the ribbon, choose **Remove Members**.  
  
   2.  In the **Remove Members** dialog box, choose **Remove**.  
  
       > [!NOTE]
