# Onboard your organization and users

New to Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises)? We've put together step-by-step guidance, whether you’re still evaluating Customer Engagement apps, ready to make a purchase, or preparing to onboard your organization and users.  
  
## Step 1: Try out Customer Engagement (on-premises) in a free 90-day trial  
New customers and partners not already enrolled in a Microsoft Volume Licensing program can access Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) trial software.

Trials for all editions of Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) is available at the [Microsoft Download Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2025342).

## Step 2: Buy and manage Customer Engagement (on-premises)   
 With Customer Engagement (on-premises)), you can evolve your business on your terms. Start with just what you need to run your business. For example, you might want to start with the [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] apps for Sales app or the [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] apps for Customer Service app, and then add more apps as your needs change. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement](https://www.microsoft.com/dynamics365/home)  
  
 There are four ways to buy a subscription of Customer Engagement apps:  
  
-   Convert from a trial  
-   Buy direct  
-   Buy through volume licensing  
-   Buy through a cloud solution provider  


### Convert from a trial  
Trials can be converted to a full version by applying a commercial product key in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Deployment Manager. See [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544).

### Buy direct  
 To buy direct, go to the [Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps pricing page](https://www.microsoft.com/dynamics365/pricing). This page includes several different plans to fit your organization’s needs.  

### Buy through volume licensing  
 If your organization has 250 or more [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] apps users, you may be interested in [purchasing a Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps enterprise licensing agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing).  
  
### Buy through a cloud solution provider  
 A cloud solution provider can work closely with you to understand the needs of your business or organization. [Learn how to find a Dynamics 365 partner](/partner-center/).

## Step 3: Plan your deployment 
 Many decisions you make at the beginning and throughout the deployment process can have downstream effects and impact other phases of the plan. Developing a plan to deploy Customer Engagement (on-premises) is important in determining the actions to take from inception to go live. The amount of resources involved in planning depends on the size and scope of the project. Large organizations may need a deployment team, while a small organization may assign these functions to a key person.  
  
 Often times an organization will employ an independent software vendor (ISV), value-added reseller, or partner to help implement and maintain a Customer Engagement (on-premises) deployment. Partners bring experience, best practices, and industry expertise that will be valuable in the planning and deployment process.
