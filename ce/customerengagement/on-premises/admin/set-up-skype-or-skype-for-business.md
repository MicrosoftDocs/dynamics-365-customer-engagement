- Real-time communications with customers, colleagues, and team members without leaving [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps. Click or tap a personâ€™s phone number to call them.

- Get Presence information for members of the same email domain you are signed in with in [!INCLUDE[pn_skype_for_business](../includes/pn-skype-for-business.md)].
