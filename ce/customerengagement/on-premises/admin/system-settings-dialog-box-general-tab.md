| For compatibility, use the legacy form rendering engine. Note that performance may be adversely affected. | We made enhancements to Dynamics 365 apps forms so that they load faster. However, if you have forms that include unsupported customizations, these enhancements can cause compatibility problems. To avoid this, you can temporarily turn the form enhancements off by choosing **Yes**. We recommend that you reset this setting to **No** after addressing scripting problems so you can take advantage of optimized forms. <br/>**Note:**  When a form that includes unsupported customizations is used, such as unsupported [!INCLUDE[pn_JavaScript](../includes/pn-javascript.md)], the form may fail to load or the user will receive an error message. <br/>If the form just fails, set the **Use legacy form rendering** option to **Yes**. If the form loads after you select this option, you may have unsupported customizations. If the user receives an error, click "View the data that will be sent to Microsoft" and see the details in the \<CrmScriptErrorReport> tags.  |
