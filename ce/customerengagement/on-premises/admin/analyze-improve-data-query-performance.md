# Data query performance

To improve query performance, index management is executed automatically using Azure SQL Database automatic tuning. Subsequently, there’s no need to manually configure recommendations to create or drop indexes in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) or Azure SQL Database. More information: [Automatic tuning in Azure SQL Database](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-automatic-tuning)
