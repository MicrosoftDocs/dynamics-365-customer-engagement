# Data query performance and index management

To improve query performance, index management is executed automatically using Azure SQL Database automatic tuning. Subsequently, thereâ€™s no need to manually configure recommendations to create or drop indexes in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) or Azure SQL Database.
