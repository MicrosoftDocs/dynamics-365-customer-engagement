# Copy a security role to save time

If you want to create a security role that's similar to another, you can copy an existing security role and save it with a new name. You can then modify the privileges and access levels to accommodate the new role.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> - You canâ€™t copy a security role to a different business unit.  
> - Security role privileges are subject to change with updates and the copied security role could become out-of-date. You should periodically check security role privileges. See [Create an administrative user and prevent elevation of security role privilege](prevent-elevation-security-role-privilege.md) for an alternative method to assign security role privileges that will change dynamically.

    Check your security role

2. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_security](../includes/proc-settings-security.md)]  
  
3. Click **Security Roles**.  
  
4. In the list of security roles, under **Name**, click or tap to select the security role you want to copy, and then on the Actions toolbar, click or tap **More Actions** > **Copy Role**.  
  
5. In the **Copy Security Role** dialog box, in the **New Role Name** text box, type in the name for the new security role.  
  
6. To modify the new security role after creating a copy, verify that the **Open the new security role when copying is complete** check box is selected; otherwise, clear the check box.  
  
7. Click **OK**.
