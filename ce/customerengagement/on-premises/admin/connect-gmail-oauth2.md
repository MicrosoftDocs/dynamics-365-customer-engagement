# Connect Customer Engagement (on-premises) to Gmail accounts using OAuth 2.0

Follow these steps to set up server-side synchronization to send and receive email in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) from Gmail accounts using OAuth 2.0 as the authorization mechanism.

> [!NOTE]
> The Gmail OAuth email server profile requires version 9.1 or later and works for up to 100 users. Create multiple OAuth profiles to associate the same profile with multiple users.

An admin should perform the following procedures:

1. [Turn on IMAP or POP in Gmail](#turn-on-imap-or-pop-in-gmail)
1. [Create a Google API Console project](#create-a-google-api-console-project)
1. [Set up OAuth consent](#set-up-oauth-consent)
1. [Create an email server profile](#create-an-email-server-profile)

A mailbox user should perform the following procedure:

- [Set up and test the mailbox](#set-up-and-test-the-mailbox)

## Turn on IMAP or POP in Gmail

- IMAP: [Check Gmail through other email platforms](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7126229)

- POP: [Read Gmail messages on other email clients using POP](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7104828)

## Create a Google API Console project

[Create a project](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6251787?ref_topic=7014522#zippy=%2Ccreate-a-project) in the Google API Console using the Google account that will send and retrieve email.

## Set up OAuth consent

1. In the left navigation pane of the API Console, select **OAuth consent screen**.
1. Select the user type:
   - Select **Internal** if you're using a GSuite admin tenant and are creating the app exclusively for your organization.
   - Select **External** if you're testing using a standalone Gmail account.
1. Select **Create**.
1. Enter the name of the app that's asking for consent.
1. Enter the support address your users should email if they have questions about their consent.
1. Under **Authorized domains**, select **ADD DOMAIN** and then enter your environment's top private domain name; for example, `dynamics.com`.
1. Under **Developer contact information**, enter your email address.
1. Select **SAVE AND CONTINUE**.
1. In the left navigation pane, select **Credentials**.
1. Select **CREATE CREDENTIALS** > **OAuth client ID**.
1. Select or enter the following values:

   | Setting | Use |
   |---------|-----|
   | Application type | Web application |
   | Name | The name of your web client |
   | Authorized JavaScript origins | Your environment's URL; for example, `https://contoso.crm.dynamics.com` |
