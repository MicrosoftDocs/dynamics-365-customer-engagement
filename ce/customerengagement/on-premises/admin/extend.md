# Extend Customer Engagement (on-premises)

Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) is a very powerful business tool right out of the box. It becomes even more so when you extend it by: 

1. Integrating Customer Engagement (on-premises) with your email system such as Exchange Online or Gmail.
2. Adding solutions by Microsoft like Office 365 Groups or solutions from other companies.
3. Integrating with Office 365 features such as SharePoint, Skype, OneDrive, or OneNote.
