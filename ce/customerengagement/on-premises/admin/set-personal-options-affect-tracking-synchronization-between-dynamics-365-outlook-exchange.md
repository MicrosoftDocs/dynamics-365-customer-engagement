# Set personal options that affect tracking and synchronization with Outlook or Exchange

You can use the **Set Personal Options** dialog box in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) to set many options that affect tracking and synchronization.  
  
 To open the **Set Personal Options** dialog box:  
  
- In Customer Engagement (on-premises), click the **Settings** button ![Options button for Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement.](media/optionsbutton.png "Options button for Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement") in the upper-right corner of the screen, and then click **Options**.  
  
  The following table summarizes the tracking and synchronization options available in the **Set Personal Options** dialog box. The **Available** column indicates whether the option is available in Customer Engagement (on-premises). This column also indicates if the option is available for [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] synchronization, server-side synchronization (also known as “[!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] synchronization”), or both.
