To improve accessibility when reading and editing email in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises), we're introducing an app that provides an accessible email flow. This topic explains how admins can enable this flow and how end users can access it.

## For admins: Install the app

Follow these steps to deploy the solution and enable users to use the accessible flow.

**Install the app**

1. Sign in with the Customer Engagement (on-premises) system administrator or a delegated admin security role.  
  
2. Select **Admin centers** > **Dynamics 365**.  

3. Select the **Instances** tab, select the instance to add the app to, and then select **Manage your solutions** ![Manage your solutions.](media/manage-solution.png "Manage your solutions").

4. Select the **Email in Unified Interface** app, and then select **Install**.  

You can now see the app in the list of published apps. Go to **Settings** > **My Apps** to see it.

**Provide users with permissions for the accessible email access flow**

For users who want to have accessible email access, follow these steps.

1.  Go to **Settings** > **Security** > **Users**.  
  
2.  In the list, select the user or users that you want to assign a security role to.  
  
3.  Select **Manage Roles**.  
  
    Only the security roles available for a user's business unit are displayed.  
  
4.  In the **Manage User Roles** dialog box, select the **Email app access role** security role, and then select **OK**.  

**Notify users**

Once the app is installed, notify users that they need to reload the web application to see and use the accessible email flow.

## For end users: Use the accessible email flow

Users with the **Email app access role**, go to **Sales**, **Service**, or **Marketing**. Select **Email Messages** to open emails.

> [!NOTE]
> - If you don't see **Sales**, **Service**, or **Marketing**, your Customer Engagement (on-premises) has been customized. Talk to your administrator or customizer.
> - **Email Messages** will not appear if **Activities** has been customized to not be included in the sitemap.
