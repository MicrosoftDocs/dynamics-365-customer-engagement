# Manage your documents using SharePoint

Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) document management with SharePoint lets users manage common document types, such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and create folders to save and manage those documents in Customer Engagement (on-premises) that are seamlessly stored in [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)].
