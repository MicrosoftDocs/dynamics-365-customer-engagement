# Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) reporting requirements

[!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Reporting_Extensions_server_side](../includes/pn-crm-reporting-extensions-server-side.md)] are data processing extensions that are installed on the [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_Reporting](../includes/pn-sql-server-reporting.md)] server. The [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Reporting_Extensions_server_side](../includes/pn-crm-reporting-extensions-server-side.md)] accept authentication information from [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)] and pass it to the [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_Reporting](../includes/pn-sql-server-reporting.md)] server.  

::: moniker range="op-9-1"
 Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) Reporting Extensions includes two data processing extensions: [!INCLUDE[pn_Fetch_data_processing_extension](../includes/pn-fetch-data-processing-extension.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_data_processing_extension](../includes/pn-sql-data-processing-extension.md)]. By default, these extensions are installed during Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) Reporting Extensions Setup:  
  
-   The [!INCLUDE[pn_Fetch_data_processing_extension](../includes/pn-fetch-data-processing-extension.md)] is required to create, run, and schedule Fetch-based reports.  
  
-   The [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_data_processing_extension](../includes/pn-sql-data-processing-extension.md)] is required to create, run, and schedule the default (out-of-the-box) or SQL-based custom reports in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].  
  
 You don’t need [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Reporting_Extensions_server_side](../includes/pn-crm-reporting-extensions-server-side.md)] to run [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]. However, if you want to create, use, or schedule reports in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)], you need to install [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Reporting_Extensions_server_side](../includes/pn-crm-reporting-extensions-server-side.md)]. Additionally, you need to install these extensions if you want to create or import an organization, like when you migrate from an earlier version of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] using [!INCLUDE[pn_deploymentmanager](../includes/pn-deploymentmanager.md)].

## SQL Server Reporting Services

 [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_Reporting](../includes/pn-sql-server-reporting.md)] is required for reporting features in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].  
  
 For [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] reporting, you can use the following [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_SQL_Server](../includes/pn-ms-sql-server.md)] editions running on a [supported version of Windows Server](software-requirements-for-microsoft-dynamics-365-server.md#windows-server-operating-system):  

- Microsoft SQL Server 2022 Enterprise<sup>1</sup>
- Microsoft SQL Server 2022 Standard<sup>1</sup>
- Microsoft SQL Server 2022 Developer (for nonproduction use only)<sup>1</sup>
- Microsoft SQL Server 2019 Enterprise
- Microsoft SQL Server 2019 Standard
- Microsoft SQL Server 2019 Developer (for non-production use only)
- Microsoft SQL Server 2017 Enterprise
- Microsoft SQL Server 2017 Standard
- Microsoft SQL Server 2017 Developer (for non-production use only)
- Microsoft SQL Server 2016 Enterprise, with Service Pack 2 or Service Pack 3 
- Microsoft SQL Server 2016 Standard, with Service Pack 2 or Service Pack 3
- Microsoft SQL Server 2016 Developer, with Service Pack 2 or Service Pack 3 (for non-production use only) 

<sup>1</sup>Requires [Service Update 1.25 for Microsoft Dynamics Customer Engagement v9 (on-premises)](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/-service-update-1-25-for-microsoft-dynamics-crm-on-premises-9-1-54bbb86c-1e34-4bea-92b9-dd2f45b74358)

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_short](../includes/pn-sql-server-short.md)] Compact or [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_SQL_Server_Express_long](../includes/pn-ms-sql-server-express-long.md)] editions are not supported for use with [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)].  
> - Using a [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_short](../includes/pn-sql-server-short.md)] [!INCLUDE[pn_reporting_services_short](../includes/pn-reporting-services-short.md)] server running in [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] mode isn't supported with [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]. For more information about SQL Server [!INCLUDE[pn_reporting_services_short](../includes/pn-reporting-services-short.md)] [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] mode, see [Reporting Services Report Server (SharePoint Mode)](/sql/reporting-services/report-server-sharepoint/reporting-services-report-server-sharepoint-mode?view=sql-server-2016&preserve-view=true).

## Dynamics 365 Reporting Extensions requirements

 The [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Reporting_Extensions_server_side](../includes/pn-crm-reporting-extensions-server-side.md)] component has the following requirements:  
  
-   You must complete [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Dynamics_CRM_Server_Setup](../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-server-setup.md)] *before* you run Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) Reporting Extensions Setup.  
  
-   You can install and run [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Reporting_Extensions_server_side](../includes/pn-crm-reporting-extensions-server-side.md)] on only one instance of [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_Reporting](../includes/pn-sql-server-reporting.md)] on a computer.  
  
-   The identity account running the instance of [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_Reporting](../includes/pn-sql-server-reporting.md)] where the [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Reporting_Extensions_server_side](../includes/pn-crm-reporting-extensions-server-side.md)] are running can’t be the local system or a virtual account. This is required for [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] reporting to work because the identity account must be added to the `PrivReportingGroup` Active Directory security group that is used by [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].  
  
-   Separate deployments of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] cannot share one [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_Reporting](../includes/pn-sql-server-reporting.md)] server. However, a single deployment of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] that has multiple organizations can use the same [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_Reporting](../includes/pn-sql-server-reporting.md)] server.  
  
-   You must run the Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) Reporting Extensions Setup on a computer that has a supported version and edition of [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_Reporting](../includes/pn-sql-server-reporting.md)] installed. More information: [SQL Server Reporting Services](microsoft-dynamics-365-reporting-requirements.md#sql_server_reporting_services)  
  
-   For smaller data sets and fewer users, you can use a single-server deployment or a multi-server deployment. With larger data sets or more users, performance decreases quickly when running complex reports. Use a multi-server deployment with one computer that is running [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_short](../includes/pn-sql-server-short.md)] for [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)], and another server for [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_Reporting](../includes/pn-sql-server-reporting.md)].
