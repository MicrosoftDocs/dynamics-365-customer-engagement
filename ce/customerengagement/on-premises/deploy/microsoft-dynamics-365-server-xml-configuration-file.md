# Microsoft Dynamics 365 Server XML configuration file

::: moniker range="op-9-1"
[!INCLUDE [applies-not-to-9-1](../includes/applies-not-to-9-1.md)]

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="op-9-0"

The /config [drive:] [[path] configfilename.xml]] command-line parameter provides [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Dynamics_CRM_Server_Setup](../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-server-setup.md)] with required information. The information supplied by the XML configuration file is required by each installation screen.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The XML elements must be in English (US). An XML configuration file that has localized XML elements won’t work correctly. For example, if you have a German version of [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_legacy](../includes/pn-crm-legacy.md)], the XML file elements must still be English (US).  
>   
>  By default, Setup will use UTF-8 encoding for the Setup XML configuration file. Setup can’t load an XML configuration file when there are extended characters in the file. You’ll receive an error message from Setup that the XML file is invalid. If the XML configuration file contains extended characters, you can work around this issue by saving the XML configuration file by using **Unicode** encoding. To do this, open the XML configuration file in [!INCLUDE[pn_Notepad](../includes/pn-notepad.md)], select **Save As**, in the **Encoding** list select **Unicode**, and then select **Save**.  
  
 An explanation of each XML element and a sample XML file for a Full Server installation follows. For information about how to install separate server roles by using the command prompt, see [Install Microsoft Dynamics 365 Server roles](install-using-command-prompt.md) in this guide.  
  
<a name="BKMK_ConfigRef"></a>   
## Configuration file reference  
 **\<CRMSetup> \</CRMSetup>**  
 The configuration file must be a valid XML file that uses **\<CRMSetup>** as the root element.  
  
 **\<Server> \</Server>**  
 Specifies a Dynamics 365 Server installation. All the  entries that follow must be inside the **\<Server>** elements.  
  
 **\<InstallType>Uninstall/Repair/Configure\</InstallType>**  
 Specifies the type of installation that Setup will perform. The following options are available:  
  
-   **Uninstall**. Uninstalls [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)].  
  
-   **Repair**. Starts Setup in repair mode.  
  
-   **Configure**. Starts Setup in configuration mode.  
  
 **\<Patch update="true"/"false">\\\ServerName\ShareName\Patch_Location\</Patch>**  
 Determines the behavior of the update [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Dynamics_CRM_Server_Setup](../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-server-setup.md)] technology. This feature lets Setup perform a one-time search for, and if applicable, download and apply the latest installation files for Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises).  
  
 By default, this element doesn’t specify a location, which configures Setup to search for available updates by using [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Update](../includes/pn-microsoft-update.md)]. If you want Setup to install updates from another location, such as a share on your network, add the file paths to the .msp file in the element, as shown in the following topic.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The patch update feature can only be used  for updates to [!INCLUDE[pn_Setup](../includes/pn-setup.md)], also known as self-healing [!INCLUDE[pn_Setup](../includes/pn-setup.md)]. It cannot be used to apply application updates. More information: [Update Microsoft Dynamics 365](update-microsoft-dynamics-crm.md)  
  
 *update*  
  
 Specifies whether Setup will look for, download, and apply updates for [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Dynamics_CRM_Server_Setup](../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-server-setup.md)]. We recommend that you let Setup download the latest version by specifying **true**. By default, this value is set to **false**. If the value is set to **false**, Setup ignores this step and continues with the installation. However, if you run Setup by using the */Q* or */QR* parameter, you must specify this element.  
  
 **\<SqlServer>SQLServername\InstanceName\</SqlServer>**  
 Specifies the name of the instance of [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_SQL_Server](../includes/pn-ms-sql-server.md)] that will manage the  database files. If you use the default instance, you can provide the name of the computer where [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_short](../includes/pn-sql-server-short.md)] is installed. If [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_short](../includes/pn-sql-server-short.md)] is running on the computer where you’re installing , you can specify ". " or "localhost".  
  
 **\<Database create="true"/"false" update="true"/"false"/>**  
 *create*  
  
 Values for this parameter are either **true** or **false**. **True** causes Setup to create a new configuration database. **False** causes Setup to connect to an existing  configuration database.  
  
 *update*  
  
 Values for this parameter are either `true` or `false`. When you select `true`, Setup writes the appropriate server deployment information to the configuration database (MSCRM_CONFIG). Select `false` only when you are using a pre-existing configuration database and you don’t want Setup to update the server deployment information. When you select `false`, the appropriate server deployment information for the computer where Dynamics 365 Server is being installed must already exist in the configuration database for Setup to complete successfully. The default value is `true`.  
  
 **\<Organization>Organization friendly or long name\</Organization>**  
 Specifies the long name of your organization. The name can be up to 250 characters long and extended characters are supported.  
  
 **\<OrganizationUniqueName>Unique name\</OrganizationUniqueName>**  
 *UniqueName*  
  
 Specifies the name of your organization in the URL that users will use to access the deployment. There is a 30 character limit. Extended characters or spaces are not allowed. If you don’t specify this element or leave the value blank, Setup will generate a short name based on the **\<Organization>** element value.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The unique organization name will be used to construct the URL for users to sign-in to the application. Therefore, we recommend that you limit the length of the unique organization name to reduce the overall length of the URL.  
  
 **\<muoptin optin="true”/“false" />**  
 Specifies whether to use [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Update](../includes/pn-microsoft-update.md)] to download and install updates to Dynamics 365 Server and other installed applications. After the installation is completed, this feature helps keep your computer up-to-date on an ongoing basis.  
  
-   **True**. When you specify this option, Setup will opt in to [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Update](../includes/pn-microsoft-update.md)] as the update service and use the Windows automatic updating settings on the computer. Windows automatic update settings can be viewed in [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Windows_Update](../includes/pn-ms-windows-update.md)] in [!INCLUDE[pn_Control_Panel](../includes/pn-control-panel.md)]. [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Update](../includes/pn-microsoft-update.md)] helps make sure that your computer has the latest technology, which can help reduce the risk of vulnerabilities and security issues.  
  
-   **False**. When you specify this option, Setup won’t change the existing Windows automatic update settings. If the computer isn’t already configured to use [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Update](../includes/pn-microsoft-update.md)] as the update service, we recommend that you have another method to install updates on the computer, such as by using [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Windows_Update_Srvcs_short](../includes/pn-ms-windows-update-srvcs-short.md)]. If left blank, a value of **false** will be selected.  
  
 **\<OU> OU=value,DC=value,DC=value,DC=value,DC=value\</OU>**  
 The \<OU> element specifies the [!INCLUDE[pn_Active_Directory](../includes/pn-active-directory.md)] organizational unit (OU) where the security groups will be created, for example, \<OU> OU=Dynamics CRM, DC=MySubDomain, DC=MyDomain, DC=com\</OU>.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  You can’t use the \<Groups> element with the \<OU> element. Setup won’t continue if you specify both elements together.  
  
 **\<PreferredDC>servername.domain.com\</PreferredDC>**  
 Specifies the domain controller to contact when performing operations that require [!INCLUDE[pn_Active_Directory](../includes/pn-active-directory.md)]. If not specified, Setup will use the first domain controller available. This setting is only available when you use a configuration file.  
  
 **\<LicenseKey>KeyValue\</LicenseKey>**  
 Specifies the product key for this deployment. The configuration file can contain only one  product key. For example:  
  
 \<licenseKey>XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX\</licenseKey>  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If you purchase [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] through a Microsoft Volume Licensing program, the product key is provided in the license.txt file. The license.txt file is included in the Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) installation files.  
  
 **\<WebsiteUrl Create="true"/"false" port="TCPportnumber">path\</WebsiteUrl>**  
 Specifies the website to be used for the application. Use **Create="true"** to create a new  website and leave the value between the element tags blank. Use **port**="*TCPportnumber*", where *TCPportnumber* is a valid and available [!INCLUDE[pn_TCP](../includes/pn-tcp.md)] port number, to specify the port for connecting to the  application. If left blank, the port number that will be used is 5555.  
  
 Specify **Create="false"** to use an existing website and then you must type the website path in the element tags by using one of the following formats. When you use the **Create="false"** attribute, the port attribute is ignored.  
  
 For example:  
  
-   https://*server:port*/ or https:// *server.contoso.com*  
  
-   /LM/W3SVC/*n*, where *n* is the website ID. 1 is the default website.  
  
 **\<Help anonymous="true"/"false">https://host/Help\</Help>**  
 Optional element to specify a different URL where Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) [!INCLUDE[pn_doc_help_long](../includes/pn-doc-help-long.md)] is located. This setting is typically used in a multiserver deployment or to replace the default URL such as when using a host header. If you select `false` to disable anonymous access, it may produce repeated logon prompts for users who access  [!INCLUDE[pn_doc_help_long](../includes/pn-doc-help-long.md)]. This setting is only available when you use a configuration file.  
  
 **\<InstallDir>c:\program files\Microsoft Dynamics CRM\</InstallDir>**  
 Specifies the folder in which application files will be installed. By default, Setup will use the folder C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics CRM.  
  
 **\<basecurrency isocurrencycode="CurrencyCode"  currencyname="CurrencyName" currencysymbol="CurrencySymbol" currencyprecision=”2"/"3"/"4”/>**  
 *isocurrencycode*  
  
 Specifies the ISO three-letter currency-code, display name, and symbol to use for the base currency. For example, if you want to use U.S. dollars as the base currency, use **isocurrencycode="USD"**. You must use a valid ISO currency description for the **isocurrencycode** attribute.  
  
 *currencyname* and *currencysymbol*  
  
 You must also specify the currency-name and currency-symbol display names for the ISO base currency. For example, if the ISO currency code is USD, the currency name should be "US Dollar" and the currency symbol should be "$". However, you can use any string that you want for these attributes.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  After Setup is complete, you cannot change the base ISO currency code. However, you can change the base-currency name, base-currency symbol, and base-currency precision.  
  
 The currency codes are provided from [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_.Net_Framework](../includes/pn-microsoft-net-framework.md)] and may change.  
  
 *currencyprecision*  
  
 You must specify the precision for the base currency that you specified in the **currencycode** attribute. Valid values depend on the type of currency that you specify. For example, USD valid values are 1 – 9 and the default value is 2.  
  
 **\<OrganizationCollation>CollationName\</OrganizationCollation>**  
 This optional element specifies the [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_short](../includes/pn-sql-server-short.md)] database collation name to use for the organization database. The default collation depends on the language of Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) that you’re installing, for example, Latin1_General_Cl_Al, which is the default collation for English (US) language deployments. For more information about database collation, see  [Collation and Unicode Support](/sql/relational-databases/collations/collation-and-unicode-support?view=sql-server-2016&preserve-view=true).  
  
 **\<CrmServiceAccount type="DomainUser"/"NetworkService">**   
 **\<ServiceAccountLogin>Domain\User\</ServiceAccountLogin>**   
 **\<ServiceAccountPassword>password\</ServiceAccountPassword>**   
 **\</CrmServiceAccount>**  
 Specifies the service account used to run the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] Unzip Service and [!INCLUDE[pn_ASP.NET_short](../includes/pn-asp-net-short.md)] AppPool application pool identity.  
  
 Accepted values are DomainUser, which will use the specified domain user provided in the \<*prefixServiceAccount*> element or *NetworkService*, which uses the Network Service system account. However, using the Network Service system account isn’t recommended because it may limit some database operations such as organization create, import, upgrade, or update. By default, Setup will use the *DomainUser* option. If *DomainUser* or no type is specified, \<**ServiceAccountLogin**> and \<**ServiceAccountPassword**> are required. When you run Setup by using the */Q* or */QR* parameter, if this element isn’t specified, the Network Service account will be used.  
  
> [!WARNING]
>  Maintaining the configuration file that has \<**ServiceAccountLogin**> and \<**ServiceAccountPassword**> values specified is a security risk because you’re storing a password in plain text. Delete these elements as soon as the configuration file is used to install Dynamics 365 Server.  
>   
>  We strongly recommend that you select a low-privilege domain account that is dedicated to running these services and isn’t used for any other purpose. Additionally, the user account that is used to run a [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] service can’t be a [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] user. This domain account must be a member of the Domain Users group. Additionally, if the [!INCLUDE[pn_Asynchronous_Service](../includes/pn-asynchronous-service.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_Sandbox_Processing_Service](../includes/pn-sandbox-processing-service.md)] roles are installed, such as in a Full Server or a [!INCLUDE[Back_End_Server](../includes/back-end-server.md)] installation, the domain account must a member of the Performance Log Users security group.  
  
 **\<SandboxServiceAccount type="DomainUser"/"NetworkService">**   
 **\<ServiceAccountLogin>Domain\User\</ServiceAccountLogin>**   
 **\<ServiceAccountPassword>password\</ServiceAccountPassword>**   
 **\</SandboxServiceAccount>**  
 Specifies the service account to use for the [!INCLUDE[pn_Sandbox_Processing_Service](../includes/pn-sandbox-processing-service.md)].  
  
 Accepted values are *DomainUser*, which will use the specified domain user provided in the \<*prefixServiceAccount*> element or *NetworkService*, which uses the Network Service system account. By default, Setup will use the *DomainUser* option. If *DomainUser* or no type is specified, \<**ServiceAccountLogin**> and \<**ServiceAccountPassword**> are required. When you run Setup by using the */Q* or */QR* parameter, if this element isn’t specified, the Network Service account will be used.  
  
> [!WARNING]
>  Maintaining the configuration file that has \<**ServiceAccountLogin**> and \<**ServiceAccountPassword**> values specified is a security risk because you’re storing a password in plain text. Delete these elements as soon as the configuration file is used to install Dynamics 365 Server.  
>   
>  If you don’t specify this element, Setup will use the account specified in the \<**CrmServiceAccount**> element to run this service. Therefore, we recommend that you specify a different low-privilege user account for each of the service accounts.  
  
 **\<DeploymentServiceAccount type="DomainUser"/"NetworkService">**   
 **\<ServiceAccountLogin>Domain\User\</ServiceAccountLogin>**   
 **\<ServiceAccountPassword>password\</ServiceAccountPassword>**   
 **\<DeploymentServiceAccount>**  
 Specifies the service account to use for the [!INCLUDE[pn_Deployment_Web_Service](../includes/pn-deployment-web-service.md)].  
  
 Accepted values are *DomainUser*, which will use the specified domain user provided in the \<*prefixServiceAccount*> element or *NetworkService*, which uses the Network Service system account. However, using the Network Service system account isn’t recommended because it may limit some database operations such as organization create, import, upgrade, or update. By default, Setup will use the DomainUser option. If DomainUser or no type is specified, \<**ServiceAccountLogin**> and \<**ServiceAccountPassword**> are required. When you run Setup by using the */Q* or */QR* parameter, if this element is not specified the Network Service account will be used.  
  
> [!CAUTION]
>  Maintaining the configuration file that has \<**ServiceAccountLogin**> and \<**ServiceAccountPassword**> values specified is a security risk because you’re storing a password in plain text. Delete these elements as soon as the configuration file is used to install Dynamics 365 Server. If you don’t specify this element, Setup will use the account specified in the \<**CrmServiceAccount**> element to run this service. Therefore, we recommend that you specify a different low-privilege user account for each of the service accounts. In addition to the permissions required by the other  service accounts, the [!INCLUDE[pn_Deployment_Web_Service](../includes/pn-deployment-web-service.md)] account requires system administrator permission on the [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_short](../includes/pn-sql-server-short.md)], and must be a member of the local administrator group where [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_short](../includes/pn-sql-server-short.md)] is running to be able to create or import organizations.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  To perform organization operations through the [!INCLUDE[pn_Deployment_Web_Service](../includes/pn-deployment-web-service.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_PowerShell](../includes/pn-powershell.md)], the Deployment Service account must have system administrator permissions on the computer that is running [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_short](../includes/pn-sql-server-short.md)] and must be a member of the local administrators group where [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_short](../includes/pn-sql-server-short.md)] is installed. Additionally, the user that is performing the organization operations should be a [!INCLUDE[pn_Deployment_Administrator](../includes/pn-deployment-administrator.md)].  
>   
>  The [!INCLUDE[pn_Deployment_Administrator](../includes/pn-deployment-administrator.md)] role can be granted in [!INCLUDE[pn_deploymentmanager](../includes/pn-deploymentmanager.md)].  
  
 \<**AsyncServiceAccount type="DomainUser"/"NetworkService">**  
**\<ServiceAccountLogin>Domain\User\</ServiceAccountLogin>**  
**\<ServiceAccountPassword>password\</ServiceAccountPassword>**  
**\<AsyncServiceAccount>**  
 Specifies the service account to use for the asynchronous processing services.  
  
 Accepted values are *DomainUser*, which will use the specified domain user provided in the \<*prefixServiceAccount*> element or *NetworkService*, which uses the Network Service system account. However, using the Network Service system account isn’t recommended because it may limit some database operations such as organization create, import, upgrade, or update. By default, Setup will use the *DomainUser* option. If *DomainUser* or no type is specified, \<**ServiceAccountLogin**> and \<**ServiceAccountPassword**> are required.

For information about the permissions required for [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] services and what type of account to use, see [Security considerations for Dynamics 365](security-considerations-for-microsoft-dynamics-365.md).  
  
 **\<SQM optin=" true / false"/>**  
 Specifies whether you will participate in the Customer Experience Improvement Program. If you specify **true**, you’ll participate in the program.  
    
 **\<Reporting URL="https://srsserver1/ReportServer"/>**  
 *URL*  
  
 Specifies the URL of the Report Server.  
  
 **\<Groups autogroupmanagementoff="true/false">**   
**\<PrivUserGroup>CN=value,OU=value,DC=value,DC=value,DC=value\</PrivUserGroup>**   
**\<SQLAccessGroup>CN=value,OU=value,DC=value,DC=value,DC=value\</SQLAccessGroup>**

**\<PrivReportingGroup>CN=value,OU=value,DC=value,DC=value,DC=value\</PrivReportingGroup>**   
**\</Groups>**  
 When specified, Setup will use the existing groups in [!INCLUDE[pn_Active_Directory](../includes/pn-active-directory.md)] instead of creating them during installation. If \<**automanagegroupsoff**> is **true**, Setup will not add or remove any members to those groups. If you specify \<**automanagegroupsoff**> as **true**, you must manually create and add the appropriate membership to these groups for users to be able to run the application, and you must continue to do so as new members are added or removed from [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  -   You can’t use the **\<Groups>** element with the **\<OU>** element.  Setup won’t continue if you specify both elements together.  
> -   [!INCLUDE[cc_privusergroup_nesting](../includes/cc-privusergroup-nesting.md)]  
  
 This setting is only available when you use a configuration file.  
  
 **\<remoteinstall>"true" / "false" \</remoteinstall>**  
 This option is required when you run  a remote installation by using [!INCLUDE[pn_PowerShell](../includes/pn-powershell.md)] remoting. The default value is **false**.  
  
 **\<Reboot>"true" / "false"\</Reboot>**  
 If this option is not specified, the default is **false**. This means that the server won’t automatically restart at the end of Setup. Also, this option applies only to a final install restart, and not previous restarts that may be required for other components.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The installation of [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_.Net_Framework](../includes/pn-microsoft-net-framework.md)] may require you to restart your computer before you can continue to run [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Dynamics_CRM_Server_Setup](../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-server-setup.md)].  
  
 **\<Email>**   
**\<IncomingExchangeServer name="ServerName"/>**  
 This optional element specifies the [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange_Server_full](../includes/pn-exchange-server-full.md)] computer or [!INCLUDE[pn_POP3_short](../includes/pn-pop3-short.md)] that will be used by the [!INCLUDE[pn_emailrouter](../includes/pn-emailrouter.md)] to route incoming email messages. If not specified and later the [!INCLUDE[pn_emailrouter](../includes/pn-emailrouter.md)] is used in the deployment, the computer must be added to the **PrivUserGroup** security group.  
  
 **\</Email>**  
 Specifies the email server that will be used for email routing.  
  
 **\<configdb>**  
 This is the parent for the following encryption key elements:  
  
> [!WARNING]
>  By default, encryption keys aren’t stored in the configuration database in an encrypted format. We strongly recommend that you specify encryption when you run Setup by using the following entries.  
  
 **\<encryptionkeys certificate="CrmEncryptionCertificate" generate="true"/"False" password="SCpassword" keysource="uniqueID">**  
 The \<**encryptionkeys**> element specifies how, and whether, to encrypt the keys that are stored in the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] system. Use **generate="true"** to enable the system-generated keys that are encrypted. The **keysource** may be any value, but must be different from other **keysource** values. **SCpassword** is the password that will be used to create the symmetric certificate. This setting is only available when you use a configuration file.  
  
> [!WARNING]
>  Maintaining a configuration file that has **password** and **keysource** values specified is a security risk because you are storing a password and key information in plain text. We recommend that you save the password in a secure location from where it can be retrieved later for recovery. Then, delete these elements as soon as the configuration file is used to install Dynamics 365 Server.  
  
 **\<encryptionkey physicalname="CrmSymmetricKey" virtualname="CrmKeyEncryptionKey"/>**  
 Each \<**encryptionkeys**> element specifies a mapping between a symmetric key store in the [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_SQL_Server](../includes/pn-ms-sql-server.md)] database to a virtual key name, hard-coded in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] for encrypting data in the configuration database. This setting is only available when you use a configuration file.  
  
 **\</encryptionkeys>**   
**\</configdb>**  
 **\<LaunchReportingExtensionsSetup>"false" / "true"\</LaunchReportingExtensionsSetup>**  
 Optional element that specifies whether to start Dynamics 365 Reporting Extensions Setup immediately after Dynamics 365 Server Setup completes. By default, the value for this element is false and Dynamics 365 Reporting Extensions Setup won’t start after Dynamics 365 Server Setup completes. Additionally, Dynamics 365 Reporting Extensions Setup will only start when the following conditions are true:  
  
-   Dynamics 365 Server Setup will be creating or upgrading the first organization in the deployment  
  
-   The specified [!INCLUDE[pn_Report_Server](../includes/pn-report-server.md)] computer is the local computer where Setup is running
