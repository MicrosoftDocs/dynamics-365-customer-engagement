# Add a new Deployment Administrator

You can grant or remove the [!INCLUDE[pn_Deployment_Administrator](../includes/pn-deployment-administrator.md)] role in the **Deployment Administrators** node in [!INCLUDE[pn_deploymentmanager](../includes/pn-deploymentmanager.md)].  
  
> [!TIP]
>  You can implement the procedure described here by using a [!INCLUDE[pn_PowerShell](../includes/pn-powershell.md)] cmdlet. For more information, see [Using Windows PowerShell to perform Deployment Manager tasks](powershell-deployment-manager-tasks.md).  

### Add a Deployment Administrator
  
1. In the console tree, right-click **Deployment Administrators**, and then select **New [!INCLUDE[pn_Deployment_Administrator](../includes/pn-deployment-administrator.md)]**.  
  
1. In the **Select User** dialog box, in the **Enter object name to select** box, type the name of a user, who must exist in [!INCLUDE[pn_Active_Directory](../includes/pn-active-directory.md)], and then select **Check Names**.  
  
1. After the user name is accepted, select **OK**.

1. Select the **Users** folder from the right navigation pane.

1. In the **Select Groups** dialog box, type *privusergroup* in the **Enter the object names to select** text box, make sure the active directory name is **PrivUserGroup_OUname**, where *OUname* is the name of the Active Directory organizational unit where the security groups that are used by Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement are located, and then select **Check Names**.
   
    The name is resolved in the **Select Groups** dialog box.
