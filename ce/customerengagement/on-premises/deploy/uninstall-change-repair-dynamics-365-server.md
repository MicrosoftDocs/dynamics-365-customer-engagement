# Uninstall, change, or repair Dynamics 365 Server

To perform [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)] maintenance, select from the following options that are available. Before selecting an option, you must start **Programs and Features** in [!INCLUDE[pn_Control_Panel](../includes/pn-control-panel.md)].  
  
1.  Log on to the computer where the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)] application is installed. Then, start **Programs and Features** in **Control Panel**.  
  
2.  Select from the following options.  
  
    -   **Uninstall**. Selecting this option will remove [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)] from the computer. To do this, right-click **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Server**, select **Uninstall/Change**, select **Uninstall** to remove [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)], and then select **Uninstall**.

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        >  The [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] uninstall process does not remove some components, such as the [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_short](../includes/pn-sql-server-short.md)] databases, [!INCLUDE[pn_Active_Directory](../includes/pn-active-directory.md)] groups, or the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] website (when the website is not created by [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Dynamics_CRM_Server_Setup](../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-server-setup.md)]). Those components must be removed manually. Additionally, some components installed during [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Dynamics_CRM_Server_Setup](../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-server-setup.md)] are not removed during an uninstall.

        > [!NOTE]
        >  Repairing a [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)] installation reinstalls the program files. It has no effect on the databases. To recover from [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] database problems, you must restore the MSCRM_CONFIG and *OrganizationName*_MSCRM databases. For information about database backup and failure recovery, see [Backing up SQL Server, including Reporting Services](back-up-the-microsoft-dynamics-365-system.md#BKMK_BackupSQL).
