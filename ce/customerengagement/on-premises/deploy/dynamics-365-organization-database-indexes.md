# Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) organization database indexes

The indexes that are created in a [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] organization database are designed to provide fast retrieval of commonly requested data from tables and views stored on a [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_SQL_Server](../includes/pn-ms-sql-server.md)]. Here are a few characteristics for the indexes that are created in a [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] organization database.  
  
-   Depending on the version and update applied, a [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] organization database without any customizations or installed solutions (out-of-box database) has between 1,000 and 1,600 total indexes.  
  
-   Later versions of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] have more features and, subsequently, more database objects such as tables and indexes.  
  
-   At least five new indexes are created whenever you create a new entity or reference a new column in a quick find.  
  
-   Installing a solution increases the number of total indexes.  
  
## How to get a list of all indexes stored in an organization database  
 To get a list of all indexes, run the following sample SQL query against the organization database.  
  
```  
SELECT s.name +'.'+t.name AS 'table_name',i.name,i.index_id  
FROM sys.schemas s JOIN sys.tables t ON s.schema_id=t.schema_id  
JOIN sys.indexes i ON t.object_id=i.object_id LEFT OUTER  JOIN sys.objects o   
ON o.parent_object_id=t.object_id AND i.name=o.name  
WHERE i.name is not null  
  
```
