# Manage organizations



Use the **Organizations** page to view, change, add, enable, disable, and import organizations for [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].  
  
> [!TIP]
>  You can implement the procedure described here by using a [!INCLUDE[pn_PowerShell](../includes/pn-powershell.md)] cmdlet. For more information, see [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) PowerShell Reference](/powershell/dynamics365/customer-engagement/overview?view=dynamics365ce-ps&preserve-view=true).  
  
### View the Organizations page  
  
1.  In the console tree, select **Organizations**.  
  
2.  In the details pane, the organizations are listed, and in the **Actions** pane, organization-related tasks are listed.
