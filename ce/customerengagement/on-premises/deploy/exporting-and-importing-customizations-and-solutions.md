# Exporting and importing customizations and solutions



The Solutions feature can be used to export all unmanaged solution customizations such as modified forms, views, and mappings. Later, the solution customization can be imported to the same organization or a different organization. For example, you can export a solution from an on-premises deployment of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] and then import it into a [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] organization.  
  
 The Solutions feature is located in the **Customizations** area of the **Settings** area in the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] web application. It is a good practice to export your customizations before you make changes so that they can be imported back if there is unexpected behavior. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Use the default solution to customize](../customize/use-solutions-for-your-customizations.md)
