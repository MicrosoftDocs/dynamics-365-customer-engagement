# Configure a Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) Internet-facing deployment



You can deploy [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] so that remote users can connect to the application through the Internet. The following [!INCLUDE[pn_Internet_facing_deployment](../includes/pn-internet-facing-deployment.md)] configurations are supported:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] for internal users only  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] for internal users and [!INCLUDE[pn_ifd_short](../includes/pn-ifd-short.md)] access  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] for IFD-only access  
  
 Configuring an IFD enables access to [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] from the Internet, outside the company firewall, without using a virtual private network (VPN) solution. [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] configured for Internet access uses claims-based authentication to verify credentials of external users. When you configure [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] for Internet access, integrated [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Authentication](../includes/pn-windows-authentication.md)] must remain in place for internal users.  
  
 To let users access the application over the Internet, the server that is running [!INCLUDE[pn_Internet_Information_Services](../includes/pn-internet-information-services.md)] where the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] application is installed must be available over the Internet.  
  
 For more information, see [Accessing Microsoft Dynamics 365 from the Internet - Claims-based authentication and IFD requirements](software-requirements-for-microsoft-dynamics-365-server.md#Claims_and_IFD_requirements).  
  
<a name="BKMK_ClaimsAuth"></a>   
## About claims-based authentication  
 The claims-based security model extends traditional authentication models to include other directory sources that contain information about users. This identity federation lets users from various sources, such as [!INCLUDE[pn_Active_Directory_Domain_Services](../includes/pn-active-directory-domain-services.md)], customers via the Internet, or business partners, authenticate with native single sign-on.  
  
 The claims-based model has three components: the relying party, which needs the claim to decide what it is going to do; the identity provider, which provides the claim; and the user, who decides what if any information they want to provide. Microsoft provides a claims-based access solution called [!INCLUDE[pn_Active_Dir_Fed_Svcs_AD_FS](../includes/pn-active-dir-fed-svcs-ad-fs.md)]. AD FS enables [!INCLUDE[pn_Active_Directory_Domain_Services](../includes/pn-active-directory-domain-services.md)] to be an identity provider in the claims-based access platform.  
  
 AD FS consists of the following components:  
  
-   AD FS Framework provides developers pre-built .NET security logic for building claims-aware applications, enhancing either [!INCLUDE[pn_ASP.NET_short](../includes/pn-asp-net-short.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_WCF_short](../includes/pn-wcf-short.md)] applications.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[pn_Active_Dir_Fed_Svcs_AD_FS](../includes/pn-active-dir-fed-svcs-ad-fs.md)] is a [!INCLUDE[pn_security_token_service](../includes/pn-security-token-service.md)] for issuing and transforming claims, enabling federations, and managing user access. [!INCLUDE[pn_Active_Dir_Fed_Svcs_AD_FS](../includes/pn-active-dir-fed-svcs-ad-fs.md)] supports the WS-Trust, WS-Federation, and Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) protocols. [!INCLUDE[pn_Active_Dir_Fed_Svcs_AD_FS](../includes/pn-active-dir-fed-svcs-ad-fs.md)] can also issue manage information cards for AD DS users.

## Internet-facing server best practices  
  
<a name="BKMK_ImplementPassword"></a>   
### Implement a strong password policy  
 To reduce the risk of "brute-force attacks" we strongly recommend that you implement a strong password policy for remote users who are accessing the domain where [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] is installed. For more information about how to implement a strong password policy in [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Server](../includes/pn-windows-server.md)], see [Creating a Strong Password Policy](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc736605\(WS.10\).aspx) and the "Understanding User Accounts" topic in [!INCLUDE[pn_Active_Directory_Users_Computers](../includes/pn-active-directory-users-computers.md)] Help.  
  
<a name="BKMK_InternetFirewall"></a>   
### Internet connection firewall  
 The current [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Server](../includes/pn-windows-server.md)] operating systems provide firewall software to prevent unauthorized connections to the server from remote computers. For more information about how to configure the Internet connection firewall for [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Internet_Information_Services_Manager_short](../includes/pn-ms-internet-information-services-manager-short.md)], see the [!INCLUDE[pn_iis](../includes/pn-iis.md)] Help.  
  
 For information about how to make a Web site available on the Internet, see the "Domain Name Resolution" topic in the [!INCLUDE[pn_iis](../includes/pn-iis.md)] Help.  
  
<a name="BKMK_ProxyFirewall"></a>   
### Advanced network security  
 If you do not have a secure proxy and firewall solution on your network, we recommend that you use a dedicated remote access, proxy, or firewall server, such as the [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Server](../includes/pn-windows-server.md)] Remote Access Server role or Windows Firewall with Advanced Security. For more information, see [Remote Access Overview](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/dn636119(v=ws.11)) and [Windows Firewall with Advanced Security Overview](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/hh831365(v=ws.11)).  
  
<a name="BKMK_configIFD"></a>   
## Configure IFD  
 Use the following steps as configuration guidelines.  
  
### Step 1: Configure Microsoft Dynamics 365 Server for Internet access  
 You can configure [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)] for Internet access. To do this, run the [!INCLUDE[pn_Configure_Claims-based_Wizard](../includes/pn-configure-claims-based-wizard.md)], and then run the [!INCLUDE[pn_Internet_Facing_Deployment_Configuration_Wizard](../includes/pn-internet-facing-deployment-configuration-wizard.md)] where the [!INCLUDE[pn_Deployment_Administration_Server](../includes/pn-deployment-administration-server.md)] role is installed. For more information, see [Configure claims-based authentication](configure-claims-based-authentication.md) and [Configure an Internet-facing deployment](configure-an-internet-facing-deployment.md).  

### Step 2: Configure mobile clients to connect to Dynamics 365 Server
 For the tablet and phone apps to be able to to access the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)] over the Internet, you must configure OAuth. More information: [Configure Windows Server for Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) applications that use OAuth](post-installation-configuration-guidelines-dynamics-365.md#BKMK_WS2012R2)
  
### Step 3 (optional): Configure Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Outlook to connect to Dynamics 365 Server  
 For [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_full](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-full.md)] to be able to access the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)] over the Internet, you must specify the external Web address that will be used to access the Internet-facing [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)]. To do this, you must install [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)], and then run the [!INCLUDE[pn_configuration_wizard](../includes/pn-configuration-wizard.md)]. Then, during configuration, type the external Web address in the **External Web** address box. If you install server roles, this Web address must specify where the [!INCLUDE[pn_Discovery_Web_Service](../includes/pn-discovery-web-service.md)] role is installed. For more information about how to configure [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)], see [Set up Dynamics 365 for Outlook](../../../outlook-addin/user-guide/set-up.md).
