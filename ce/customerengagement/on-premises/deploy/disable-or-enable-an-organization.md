# Disable or enable an organization



Use the **Organizations** page to disable or enable an organization. It is a best practice to disable an organization temporarily when you perform database maintenance.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  When you disable an organization, users cannot access the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] application for the organization.  
  
> [!TIP]
>  You can implement the procedure described here by using a [!INCLUDE[pn_PowerShell](../includes/pn-powershell.md)] cmdlet. For more information, see the Disable-CrmOrganization and Enable-CrmOrganization commands in the [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) PowerShell Reference](/powershell/module/microsoft.crm.powershell/?view=dynamics365ce-ps).  
  
### Disable or enable an organization  
  
1.  In the console tree, select **Organizations**. The list of organizations appears in the middle pane.  
  
2.  In the details pane, select the organization.  
  
3.  Right-click the organization, and:  
  
    -   If the organization is enabled, select **Disable**.  
  
    -   If the organization is disabled, select **Enable**.
