# Configure IFD for Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises)

[!INCLUDE[pn_crm_op_edition](../includes/pn-crm-op-edition.md)] uses claims-based authentication to authenticate internal users and to enable Internet access for external users not using VPN.  
  
In claims-based authentication, an identity provider that contains a security token service (STS) responds to authentication requests and issues SAML security tokens that include any number of claims about a user, such as a user name and groups the user belongs to. A relying party application receives the SAML token and uses the claims inside to decide whether to grant the client access to the requested resource. Claims-based authentication can be used to authenticate your organization's internal users, external users, and users from partner organizations.  
  
This content provides the steps needed to configure [!INCLUDE[pn_Internet_facing_deployment](../includes/pn-internet-facing-deployment.md)] using claims-based authentication.  
 
> [!NOTE]
> When IFD is enabled, you canâ€™t access the sitemap designer of a UCI modeldriven App using an intranet URL, such as https://internalurl.contoso.com/orgname. You must use the external URL that has been configured for IFD.
