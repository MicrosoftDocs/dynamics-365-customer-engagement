# Use Deployment Manager to manage the deployment



[!INCLUDE[pn_Deployment_Manager_long](../includes/pn-deployment-manager-long.md)] is a [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Management_Console](../includes/pn-microsoft-management-console.md)] snap-in that system administrators and value-added resellers use to manage [!INCLUDE[pn_Deployment_Administrator](../includes/pn-deployment-administrator.md)] accounts, organizations, servers, and licenses for [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] deployments.  
  
 Note the following:  
  
-   To use [!INCLUDE[pn_deploymentmanager](../includes/pn-deploymentmanager.md)], you must have the [!INCLUDE[pn_Deployment_Administrator](../includes/pn-deployment-administrator.md)] role. During [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)] Setup, the process automatically assigns that role to the user who is running Setup.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >  Make sure that at least two or three trusted people have the [!INCLUDE[pn_Deployment_Administrator](../includes/pn-deployment-administrator.md)] role. This avoids system lockout if the primary deployment administrator is unavailable.  
  
-   To create and manage [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] user accounts, you must use the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] web client or [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)].  
  
-   The [!INCLUDE[pn_Deployment_Administrator](../includes/pn-deployment-administrator.md)] role is separate from the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] user security role. A [!INCLUDE[pn_Deployment_Administrator](../includes/pn-deployment-administrator.md)] may or may not have a [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] user security role.
