# Microsoft Dynamics 365 Server hardware requirements



The following table lists the minimum and recommended hardware requirements for this version of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)] running in a Full Server configuration. These requirements assume that additional components such as [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_SQL_Server](../includes/pn-ms-sql-server.md)], [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_Reporting](../includes/pn-sql-server-reporting.md)], [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_SharePoint_long](../includes/pn-ms-sharepoint-long.md)], or [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange_Server_full](../includes/pn-exchange-server-full.md)] arenâ€™t installed or running on the system.  
  
|Component|\*Minimum|\*Recommended|  
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|  
|Processor|x64 architecture or compatible dual-core 1.5 GHz processor|Quad-core x64 architecture 2 GHz CPU or higher such as AMD Opteron or Intel Xeon systems|  
|Memory|4 GB RAM|8 GB RAM or more|  
|Hard disk|10 GB of available hard disk space|40 GB or more of available hard disk space|  
  
 \* [!INCLUDE[cc_Actual_requirements_and_product_functionality_may_vary](../includes/cc-actual-requirements-and-product-functionality-may-vary.md)]  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Running [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] on a computer that has less than the recommended requirements may result in inadequate performance.  
>   
>  Computers with more than 16 GB of RAM will require more disk space for paging, hibernation, and dump files.  
>   
>  The minimum and recommended requirements are based on 320-user load simulation tests.
