# Test internal claims-based authentication



You should now be able to access [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)] internally using claims authentication. Browse to the internal [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] webpage (for example, https://internalcrm.contoso.com).  
  
 You will be required to log on several times to the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] webpage. Subsequent visits to the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] website will only require one log on. In the browser, notice that the [!INCLUDE[pn_adfs_short](../includes/pn-adfs-short.md)] URL is loaded and then directed back to the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] server.  
  
## Troubleshooting  
 If the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] website does not display, at a command prompt, run the `iisreset` command, and then try browsing to the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] website again.  
  
 Try adding the following sites to your Trusted sites in your browser:  
  
-   https://sts1.contoso.com – change to what use in DNS  
  
-   https://internalcrm.contoso.com – change to what you use in DNS
