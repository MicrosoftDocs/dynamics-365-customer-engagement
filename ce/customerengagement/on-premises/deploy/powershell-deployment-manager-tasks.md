# Using Windows PowerShell to perform Deployment Manager tasks

You can use [!INCLUDE[pn_PowerShell](../includes/pn-powershell.md)] cmdlets to perform many of the tasks that can be performed by using the [!INCLUDE[pn_deploymentmanager](../includes/pn-deploymentmanager.md)] user interface.  
  
 For more information about the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] [!INCLUDE[pn_PowerShell](../includes/pn-powershell.md)] cmdlets, see [Overview of Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) PowerShell](/powershell/dynamics365/customer-engagement/overview?view=dynamics365ce-ps&preserve-view=true).  
  
### Register the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises)  cmdlet  
  
1.  Sign in to the administrator account on your [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] server.  
  
2.  Open a [!INCLUDE[pn_PowerShell](../includes/pn-powershell.md)] prompt.  
  
3.  Add the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] [!INCLUDE[pn_PowerShell](../includes/pn-powershell.md)] snap-in.  
  
```  
PS > Add-PSSnapin Microsoft.Crm.PowerShell   
```  
  
This command adds the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] [!INCLUDE[pn_PowerShell](../includes/pn-powershell.md)] snap-in to the current session. The snap-in is registered during installation and setup of the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] server.  
  
 Here’s how to get a list of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] cmdlets.  
  
```  
Get-Help *Crm*  
```  

For detailed help for a specific a cmdlet, use Get-Help *CRMCmdlet* –full, such as the `Import-CRMOrganization` cmdlet.  
  
```
Get-Help Import-CRMOrganization
```
