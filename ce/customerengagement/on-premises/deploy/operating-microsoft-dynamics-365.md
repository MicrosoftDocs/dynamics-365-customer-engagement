# Operating Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) (on-premises)



As you administer [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)], you’ll want to guarantee availability for your users by monitoring server status and performance, troubleshooting issues, and planning for disaster recovery.  
  
 Ongoing maintenance of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] includes operations such as updating, customizing, monitoring, and relocating or reconfiguring [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)] and required or optional technologies such as [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_SQL_Server](../includes/pn-ms-sql-server.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_SharePoint_long](../includes/pn-ms-sharepoint-long.md)].  
  
> [!CAUTION]
>  Operations that require intensive database transactions cannot be run concurrently. This includes the following operations:  
>   
> -   Language pack provisioning  
> -   Importing a solution  
> -   Publishing customizations  
> -   Database updates ([!INCLUDE[pn_crm_op_edition](../includes/pn-crm-op-edition.md)] only)  
> -   Solution update operations ([!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] only)
