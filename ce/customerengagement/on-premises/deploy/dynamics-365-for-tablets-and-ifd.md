# Dynamics 365 for tablets and IFD

[!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] on-premises deployments require Internet Facing Deployment (IFD) for users to access their data on their tablets. If you have your [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] website available over the internet but it is not using the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] IFD configuration, **it is not supported**.  To verify that your on-premises deployment is configured for IFD, open [!INCLUDE[pn_Deployment_Manager_long](../includes/pn-deployment-manager-long.md)] on your [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] Server.  The Authentication Summary section should show that both Claims-Based Authentication and Internet-Facing Deployment are enabled.
