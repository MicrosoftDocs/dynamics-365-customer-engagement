# Planning your deployment of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises)



For larger organizations, planning a deployment of [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_op_edition](../includes/pn-crm-op-edition.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)], like any enterprise-wide software, is a significant task. This guide is written for the team of people responsible for planning a deployment of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)], and provides information that is needed to design a successful implementation. In smaller organizations, several roles may be filled by one person. In larger organizations, each role may be divided among several people. These roles include the following:  
  
-   **Business managers.** Responsible for determining how your business will use [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]. This includes mapping your processes to [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)], deciding on default values, and identifying any required customizations.  
  
-   **Customization technical staff.** Responsible for implementing the planned customizations.  
  
-   **Network technical staff.** Responsible for determining how [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] will be deployed on the network and how users will access the system.  
  
-   **Project manager.** Responsible for managing an enterprise-wide implementation project.  
  
 Organizations that implement [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] software may use the services of an independent software vendor (ISV) or value-added reseller, a consultant, or other organization that is partnered with Microsoft and will help you with implementing and maintaining your [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] installation. Because of this assumption, there may be references in this guide to these "partners" who are expected to provide services to you.
