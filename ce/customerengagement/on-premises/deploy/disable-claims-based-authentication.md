# Disable claims-based authentication



Use the following procedure to disable claims-based authentication.  
  
### Disable claims-based authentication  
  
-   Disable claims-based authentication in one of two ways:  
  
    -   In the [!INCLUDE[pn_deploymentmanager](../includes/pn-deploymentmanager.md)] **Actions** pane, select **Disable Claims-Based Authentication**.  
  
    -   In the [!INCLUDE[pn_deploymentmanager](../includes/pn-deploymentmanager.md)] console tree, right-click **[!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]**, and then select **Disable Claims-Based Authentication**.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Disabling claims-based authentication also disables [!INCLUDE[pn_Internet_facing_deployment](../includes/pn-internet-facing-deployment.md)].  
>   
>  Disabling claims-based authentication does not change the binding type. It will remain set to HTTPS unless changed manually.
