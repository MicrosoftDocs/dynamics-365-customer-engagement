# Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) database maintenance



A [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] deployment consists of the following databases:  
  
-   MSCRM_CONFIG. A single database that contains [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] metadata, such as configuration and location information that is specific to each organization database.  
  
-   *OrganizationName*_MSCRM. One or more organization databases. This is the database where [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] data is stored, such as all records and activities, and metadata details like entity relationships.  
  
 Database maintenance for the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] databases should include regular backups, frequent security patch evaluation, and health check monitoring.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Database maintenance or repair operations that can result in  data loss, such as DBCC CHECKDB WITH REPAIR_ALLOW_DATA_LOSS, are not supported.
