# Accessibility in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises)
Administrators and users who have administrative responsibilities typically use the Settings area of the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] web application to manage [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]. A mouse and keyboard are the typical devices that administrators use to interact with the application.  
  
 Users who donâ€™t use a mouse can use a keyboard to navigate the user interface and complete actions. The ability to use the keyboard in this way is a result of support for keyboard interactions that a browser provides.  
  
 For more information, see the following Microsoft Dynamics 365 web application accessibility topics:  
  
-   [Use keyboard shortcuts in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement applications](../basics/keyboard-shortcuts.md)  
  
-   [Accessibility for people with disabilities](../basics/accessibility-people-with-disabilities.md)  
  
 Administrators and other users who have administrative responsibilities for on-premises deployments of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] also use [!INCLUDE[pn_Deployment_Manager_long](../includes/pn-deployment-manager-long.md)], a [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Management_Console](../includes/pn-microsoft-management-console.md)] application, to manage on-premises deployments of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)].  
  
 For more information, see the following [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Management_Console](../includes/pn-microsoft-management-console.md)] accessibility topics:  
  
-   [Navigation in MMC Using the Keyboard and Mouse](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc766527(v=ws.11))
