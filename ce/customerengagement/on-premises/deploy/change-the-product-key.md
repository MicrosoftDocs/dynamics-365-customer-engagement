# Change the product key



The **Change Product Key** dialog box lets you change the product key.  
  
> [!TIP]
>  You can implement the procedure described here by using a [!INCLUDE[pn_PowerShell](../includes/pn-powershell.md)] cmdlet. For more information, see [Using Windows PowerShell to perform Deployment Manager tasks](powershell-deployment-manager-tasks.md).  
  
### Change the product key  
  
1.  Open the **Change Product Key** dialog box in one of two ways:  
  
    -   In the **Actions** pane, select **Change Product Key**.  
  
    -   In the console tree, right-click **[!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]**, and then select **Change Product Key**.  
  
2.  Type the new product key into the **Enter the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] product key** boxes.  
  
3.  Select **Apply**.
