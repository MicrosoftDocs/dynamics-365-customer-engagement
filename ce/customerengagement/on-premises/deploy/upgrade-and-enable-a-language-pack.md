# Upgrade and enable a Language Pack



After you upgrade [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_2015_server](../includes/pn-crm-2015-server.md)], if you had [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_legacy](../includes/pn-crm-legacy.md)][!INCLUDE[cc_Language_Packs_short](../includes/cc-language-packs-short.md)] installed you should install new [!INCLUDE[cc_Language_Packs_short](../includes/cc-language-packs-short.md)] that correspond to the new version of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)]. Then, enable the [!INCLUDE[cc_Language_Packs_short](../includes/cc-language-packs-short.md)] so they are available to users after the upgrade.  
  
#### Upgrade and provision a Language Pack  
  
1.  On each [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_legacy](../includes/pn-crm-legacy.md)] server that was upgraded, download the new [!INCLUDE[cc_Language_Packs_short](../includes/cc-language-packs-short.md)]. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)][Download: Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2016 Language Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=624615)  
  
2.  Follow the steps to install each [!INCLUDE[pn_Language_Pack_short](../includes/pn-language-pack-short.md)]. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)][Install the Language Pack](install-and-enable-a-language-pack.md#install-the-language-pack)  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >  After you install a new language pack, enable it to load the new language pack files into [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)]. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)][Enable languages](../admin/enable-languages.md)  
  
3.  After you install and provision all the new [!INCLUDE[cc_Language_Packs_short](../includes/cc-language-packs-short.md)], uninstall the previous version of each [!INCLUDE[cc_Language_Packs_short](../includes/cc-language-packs-short.md)].
