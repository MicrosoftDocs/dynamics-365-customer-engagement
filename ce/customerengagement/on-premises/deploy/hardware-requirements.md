# Hardware requirements



Depending on how you plan to deploy the system, as a single-server solution, a multiple-server solution, or a clustered solution, the computer hardware that [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] and components will run on is important for acceptable application performance.  
  
 There are many factors that you must consider that can affect the hardware requirements. They include the following:  
  
-   Number of users the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] implementation will support and the way the application will be used, such as for intensive reporting.  
  
-   Number of servers and how theyâ€™re configured.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_SQL_Server](../includes/pn-ms-sql-server.md)] performance and availability.  
  
-   Integration of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] with the [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange_Server_full](../includes/pn-exchange-server-full.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_POP3_short](../includes/pn-pop3-short.md)] email servers.  
  
-   Integration with [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_Server_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-server-short.md)].  
  
-   Performance of your servers and the local area network (LAN).  
  
-   Whether users will be connecting from untrusted domains and forests or from the internet.
