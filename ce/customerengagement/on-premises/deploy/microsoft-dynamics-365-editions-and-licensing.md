# Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) editions and licensing



[!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] offers a licensing option that scales from small, to mid-level, to very large deployments.  
  
## Edition and licensing for on-premises deployments  
  
**[!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_dynamics_crm_2016_server](../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-2016-server.md)]** . There is no user limit for this edition. Features include support for multiple organizations, multiple server instances, and separate role-based service installation. Role-based services let you increase performance by installing [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)] features on different computers.     
  
### Licensing  
 A [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] deployment operates by using a single product key. However, each [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)] in a  deployment requires a server license.   
  
 You can view and upgrade a license by using the `Get-CrmAccessLicense` and `Set-CrmProductKey` [!INCLUDE[pn_PowerShell](../includes/pn-powershell.md)] commands or in [!INCLUDE[pn_deploymentmanager](../includes/pn-deploymentmanager.md)]. [!INCLUDE[pn_deploymentmanager](../includes/pn-deploymentmanager.md)] is a [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Management_Console](../includes/pn-microsoft-management-console.md)] snap-in that system administrators can use to manage organizations, servers, and licenses for deployments of [!INCLUDE [pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]. 

 <!-- For more information about licensing, see [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544).  -->
  
### Client access license types  
 You can view and modify client access license types for each user in the **Users** area of the **Settings** area in the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] web client.
