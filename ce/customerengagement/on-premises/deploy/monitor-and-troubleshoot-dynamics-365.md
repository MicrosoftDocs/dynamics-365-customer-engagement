# Monitor and troubleshoot Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises)

In [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)], you can create trace files that monitor the actions that are performed by the server and client applications. Trace files are helpful when you have to troubleshoot error messages or other issues in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].  

To enable [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)] tracing, you can use deployment-level tracing or server-level tracing. Choosing either method determines the range of server roles monitored, the degree of control, and how to enable tracing and the location of the trace files.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deployment-level tracing isn't supported with Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises), version 9.1 or later versions.

Additionally, [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Reporting_Extensions_server_side](../includes/pn-crm-reporting-extensions-server-side.md)], [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)], and [!INCLUDE[pn_moca_full](../includes/pn-moca-full.md)] can be enabled for tracing.

## Microsoft Dynamics 365 deployment-level tracing (on-premises versions only)

Deployment-level tracing monitors all [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] server roles and services, regardless of the server roles installed on the local computer. When deployment-level tracing is enabled, all server roles are monitored such as [!INCLUDE[pn_Asynchronous_Service](../includes/pn-asynchronous-service.md)], [!INCLUDE[pn_Sandbox_Processing_Service](../includes/pn-sandbox-processing-service.md)], Unzip Service, Web application (w3wp), and [!INCLUDE[pn_Deployment_Tools](../includes/pn-deployment-tools.md)] (mmc-Tools). Corresponding trace files are created.  

Deployment-level tracing is set by using [!INCLUDE[pn_PowerShell](../includes/pn-powershell.md)] commands and is maintained in the MSCRM_CONFIG database. Deployment-level tracing can only be enabled from a computer that has the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)][!INCLUDE[pn_Deployment_Tools](../includes/pn-deployment-tools.md)] server role.

The trace files are located in a folder on the computer where the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)][!INCLUDE[pn_Deployment_Tools](../includes/pn-deployment-tools.md)] server role is running. By default, the location is C:\crmdrop\logs.  
  
> [!CAUTION]
>  Trace files may contain sensitive or personal information. Use discretion when you send trace files to other people, or when you give other people the ability to view the information in a trace file.  
>   
>  When you turn on tracing it can significantly affect performance of the application. We strongly recommend that you only turn on tracing for troubleshooting issues and turn off tracing after the issue is resolved.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Before you run [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)][!INCLUDE[pn_PowerShell](../includes/pn-powershell.md)] commands, the Microsoft.Crm.PowerShell snap-in must be registered by running the `Add-PSSnapin Microsoft.Crm.PowerShell` command.  
>
>  For more information, see [Administer the deployment using Windows PowerShell](administer-the-deployment-using-windows-powershell.md).  
  
> [!TIP]
>  To get a list of the registered [!INCLUDE[pn_PowerShell](../includes/pn-powershell.md)] snap-ins, run the `Get-PsSnapin –registered` command.  
  
### View the current deployment-wide trace settings  
  
```powershell  
Get-CrmSetting TraceSettings   
```  
  
### Enable deployment-wide tracing

To turn on deployment-wide trace settings that record the maximum amount of information, including detailed logging with callstack information, run the following commands, in the order provided, from the [!INCLUDE[pn_PowerShell](../includes/pn-powershell.md)] console on the computer where the [!INCLUDE[pn_Deployment_Tools](../includes/pn-deployment-tools.md)] server role is running. To enable less detailed logging or to change the location of the log files, see [Optional parameters](monitor-and-troubleshoot-dynamics-365.md#optional).  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deployment-level tracing isn't supported with Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises), version 9.1.5 or later version.

```powershell  
$Setting = Get-CrmSetting TraceSettings$Setting.Enabled = $True $Setting.CallStack=$True$Setting.Categories="*:Verbose"Set-CrmSetting $setting  
```  
  
<a name="optional"></a>

### Optional parameters
  
- **CallStack**. Records callstack information. For detailed troubleshooting, we recommend that you turn this on. By default, this is turned off.  
  
- **Categories**. Indicates the level of detail to record.  
  
  - **Error**. By default, the **Categories** value is **Error**, which is the least detailed and only records errors.  
  
  - **Warning**. Includes warnings and errors.  
  
  - **Info**. Includes warnings, errors, and additional information.  
  
  - **Verbose**. Records the most detailed information.  
  
- **Directory**. Specifies the location of the trace log file. By default, the location is c:\crmdrop\logs.  
  
- **FileSize**. Specifies the maximum file size of the log file in megabytes before information in the trace file is overwritten.  
  
### Disable deployment-level tracing (on-premises versions only)

 To disable tracing, run the following commands, in the order provided, from the [!INCLUDE[pn_PowerShell](../includes/pn-powershell.md)] console on the computer where the [!INCLUDE[pn_Deployment_Tools](../includes/pn-deployment-tools.md)] server role is running.  
  
```powershell  
$Setting = Get-CrmSetting TraceSettings$setting.Enabled = $FalseSet-CrmSetting $setting  
```  
  
Trace files aren’t deleted when tracing is disabled. Additionally, services used by [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)] lock open the trace files. Therefore, you may have to restart any [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] services and the World Wide Web Publishing Service if these services are running on the computer where you want to delete the trace files.

> [!NOTE]
> If both deployment-level and server-level tracing are enabled on the same computer, only server-level tracing will be used.

## Microsoft Dynamics 365 server-level tracing (on-premises versions only)

Server-level tracing only monitors those [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] server roles that are running on the local computer where server-level tracing is enabled. When server-level tracing is enabled, trace files that are specific to the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] server roles or services that are running on the local computer are created. Server-level tracing does not require the [!INCLUDE[pn_Deployment_Tools](../includes/pn-deployment-tools.md)] role and can provide a greater degree of control where you can set specific trace values such as what [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] features to trace or the maximum trace file size.  
  
For more information about setting server-level tracing properties in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)], see [How to enable tracing in Microsoft Dynamics CRM](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/907490).  
  
Server-level tracing must be manually set in the [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_registry](../includes/pn-windows-registry.md)] on the computer where one or more [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] server roles are running.  
  
The server-level tracing files are located in the **Traces** folder of the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] installation folder. By default, the location is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics CRM\Trace.  
  
### Enable or disable server-level tracing  
  
> [!CAUTION]
> Trace files may contain sensitive or personal information. Use discretion when you send trace files to other people, or when you give other people the ability to view the information that a trace file contains.  
>
> When you turn on tracing it can significantly affect performance of the application. We strongly recommend that you only turn on tracing for troubleshooting issues and turn off tracing after the issue is resolved.  
  
> [!CAUTION]
> This task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, see: [How to back up and restore the registry in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756).  
  
 On the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)] that you want to turn on server-level tracing, start RegEdit and locate the following registry location: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\MSCRM`  
  
 Create the following two required new values.  
  
|Value name|Type|Value|  
|----------------|----------|-----------|  
|TraceEnabled|DWORD (32-bit)|0 or 1<br /><br /> If you use a value of 0, tracing is disabled. If you use a value of 1, tracing is enabled.|  
|TraceRefresh|DWORD (32-bit)|A number between zero and 99<br /><br /> This value must change for [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] to detect a change to any of the other trace values in the [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_registry](../includes/pn-windows-registry.md)]. For example, if the value is 2, you can set it to 1 so that other trace values changes, such as a change to TraceCategories, will be applied.|

## Enable tracing for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Reporting Extensions for SQL Server Reporting Services (on-premises versions only)  
 In [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)], you can create trace files that monitor the actions that are performed by [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Reporting_Extensions_server_side](../includes/pn-crm-reporting-extensions-server-side.md)]. Trace files are helpful when you have to troubleshoot error messages or other issues in [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Reporting_Extensions_server_side](../includes/pn-crm-reporting-extensions-server-side.md)].  
  
> [!CAUTION]
> Trace files may contain sensitive or personal information. Use discretion when you send trace files to other people, or when you give others the ability to view the information that a trace file contains.  
>
> When you turn on tracing it can significantly affect performance of the application. We strongly recommend that you only turn on tracing for troubleshooting issues and turn off tracing after the issue is resolved.  
  
 You can enable tracing for [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Reporting_Extensions_server_side](../includes/pn-crm-reporting-extensions-server-side.md)] in two ways:  
  
 [Enable tracing using registry values](monitor-and-troubleshoot-dynamics-365.md#registry)  
  
 [Enable tracing using deployment properties](monitor-and-troubleshoot-dynamics-365.md#deployment_properties)  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Traces will not be generated if the folder specified in **TraceDirectory** does not exist.  
  
<a name="registry"></a>

### Enable tracing using registry values
  
> [!CAUTION]
> This task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, see: [How to back up and restore the registry in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756).  
  
1. On the computer where you have installed [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Reporting_Extensions_server_side](../includes/pn-crm-reporting-extensions-server-side.md)], locate and then select the following registry subkey: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\MSCRM`  
  
2. Set the following registry values:  
  
   - TraceEnabled = 1  
  
   - TraceDirectory = \<*directory path where traces will be stored*>  
  
   You can also set other row values like **TraceCategories**, but they already have defaults.  
  
3.  Restart [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_Reporting](../includes/pn-sql-server-reporting.md)].  
  
<a name="deployment_properties"></a>   
### Enable tracing using deployment properties  
  
1.  Go to the **DeploymentProperties** table in the Configuration Database.  
  
2.  Locate the row with the value "TraceEnabled" and set its "BitColumn" column’s value to "True".  
  
   Other row values like **TraceCategories**, **TraceDirectory** already have default values, but you can change these values.  
  
   You’ll start seeing the traces in the directory specified in the TraceDirectory row in the **DeploymentProperties** table.  
  
3.  Restart [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_Reporting](../includes/pn-sql-server-reporting.md)].  
  
Registry settings take precedence over deployment properties. If there are any invalid entries in the registry, for example, and **TraceDirectory** does not exist, the deployment properties are used.

## Enable tracing for Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Outlook

 This section applies to [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] and on-premises versions of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]. [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] tracing monitors the instance of [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] that is running on the local computer. If an issue is isolated to a particular user running [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)], enabling [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] tracing can help determine the cause.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] tracing files are located in the C:\Users\\<username\>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\MSCRM\Traces folder.  
  
> [!CAUTION]
>  Trace files may contain sensitive or personal information. Use discretion when you send trace files to other people, or when you give other people the ability to view the information that a trace file contains.  
>   
>  When you turn on tracing it can significantly affect performance of the application. We strongly recommend that you only turn on tracing for troubleshooting issues and turn off tracing after the issue is resolved.  
  
### Enable or disable tracing for Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Outlook  
  
1.  On the computer running [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)], select **Start**, select **All Programs**, select **Microsoft Dynamics 365**, and then select **Diagnostics**.  
  
2.  Select the **Advanced Troubleshooting** tab, and then select **Tracing** to enable or select to clear **Tracing** to disable.  
  
3.  Select a Tracking level from the drop-down list.  
  
4.  Select **Save**.  
  
 You can reduce the amount of information during the trace by setting the `TraceCategories`[!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_registry](../includes/pn-windows-registry.md)] value. For example, you can set the value so that only error messages are recorded. Reducing the amount of logging can be helpful when you troubleshoot specific issues, such as when you receive error messages going offline. To do this, follow these steps.  
  
> [!CAUTION]
>  Turning on verbose tracing during process intense actions such as [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] startup, or going online and offline with [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)], is not recommended and could result in stability issues with [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)].  
>   
>  This task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, see [How to back up and restore the registry in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756).  
  
Notice that tracing must already be enabled for the following steps to work.  
  
1.  On the computer where you have installed [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] start RegEdit and locate and then select the following registry subkey: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\MSCRMClient.  
  
2.  If the TraceCategories string value does not exist add it. To do this, right-click **MSCRMClient**, select **New**, select **String Value**, type `TraceCategories` and then press ENTER.  
  
3.  Right-click **TraceCategories**, select **Modify**, type `Application.Outlook:Error`, and then select **OK**.  
  
 For more information about the values available for TraceCategories, see [How to enable tracing in Microsoft Dynamics CRM](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/907490).  
  
 Trace files are not deleted when tracing is disabled.
