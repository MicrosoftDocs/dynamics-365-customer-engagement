# Export an unmanaged solution
[!INCLUDE [applies-to-on-premises](../includes/applies-to-on-premises.md)] [Import, update, and export solutions](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/import-update-export-solutions)

Exporting a solution will allow you to transport your configuration changes from one environment to another or to store your configuration into your source control system.  Exporting a solution will export the published unmanaged changes for each component associated to the solution.  You can only export an unmanaged solution.  

We recommend that you export your unmanaged customizations periodically so that you have a backup in case anything happens. You cannot export managed solutions.  

1. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_solutions](../includes/proc-settings-solutions.md)]  

2. In the list select the solution you want to export and choose **Export**.  

3. In the **Publish Customizations** step you will be reminded that only published customizations are exported and you will have the option to **Publish All Customizations** before you choose **Next**.  

4. If your solution contains any missing required components you will see the **Missing Required Components** step. You can disregard this warning only if you intend to import this as an unmanaged solution back into the original organization, or if all of the missing components are in other managed solutions that will be present in your destination organization. Otherwise, follow the instructions in the dialog to cancel the export and add the required components.  

5. In the **Export System Settings (Advanced)** step you can choose certain system settings to include in your solution. If your solution depends on any of the groups of system settings, select them and choose **Next**.  

    See **Settings options for solution export** below for details about the settings that will be included with each option.  

6. In the **Package Type** step, you must choose whether to export the solution as an **Unmanaged** or **Managed** solution. Unmanaged solutions are intended to be used to transport configuration from one development environment to another or to check into your source control system.  Managed solutions are intented to be used to transport configuration to all other environments including test and production environments. 

7. Choose **Export** to download the solution file.  

   The exact behavior for downloading files varies between browsers.
