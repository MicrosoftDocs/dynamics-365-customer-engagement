# Use the default solution to customize  
[!INCLUDE [applies-to-on-premises](../includes/applies-to-on-premises.md)] [Use the Common Data Services Default Solution](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/use-solutions-for-your-customizations)

 ~When you customize a custom business app, you may work with the default solution. To open the default solution, open solution explorer.~
 
**EDIT: Never ever customize in the Default Solution. This is higly discouraged and customizations should always be made in purposefully created solutions. See [Create a solution](create-solution).**
