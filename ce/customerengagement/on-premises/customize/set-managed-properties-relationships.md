# Set managed properties for relationships

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-on-premises](../includes/applies-to-on-premises.md)] [View and edit relationship managed properties](/power-platform/alm/managed-properties-alm#view-and-edit-relationship-managed-properties)

 Managed properties only apply when you include a field with a managed solution and import it into another organization. These settings allow a solution maker to have some control over the level of customization that they want to allow people who install their managed solution to have when they customize an entity relationship. To set managed properties for a relationship, in solution explorer expand the entity, open the relationship, and then select  **Managed Properties** on the menu bar.  
  
 With relationships, the only managed property is **Can Be Customized**. This single setting controls all changes that can be made to the entity relationship.
