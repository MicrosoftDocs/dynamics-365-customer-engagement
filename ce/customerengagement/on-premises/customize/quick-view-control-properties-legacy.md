# Access and manage the quick view control properties of a form

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-on-premises](../includes/applies-to-on-premises.md)] [Configure a quick view component](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/sub-grid-properties-legacy)

A quick view control on a custom business app form displays data from a record that is selected in a lookup on the form. The data displayed in the control is defined using a quick view form. The data displayed is not editable, but when the primary field is included in the quick view form, it becomes a link in the legacy web client app to open the related record. It is not an actionable link in a Unified Interface app. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Create and edit quick view forms](create-edit-quick-view-forms.md)

In the list of forms, open the form of type **Main**. Then on the **Insert** tab, select **Quick View Form** to view the **Quick View Control Properties** page.
