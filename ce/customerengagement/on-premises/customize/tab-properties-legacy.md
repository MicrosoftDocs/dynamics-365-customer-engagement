# Access and manage the tab properties of a form

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-on-premises](../includes/applies-to-on-premises.md)] [Add, configure, move, or delete tabs on a form](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/add-move-or-delete-tabs-on-form)

 In the body of a form, tabs provide horizontal separation. Tabs have a label that can be displayed. If the label is displayed, tabs can be expanded or collapsed to show or hide their content by choosing the label.  

 Tabs contain up to three columns and the width of each column can be set to a percentage of the total width. When you create a new tab, each column is pre-populated with a section.  

## Tab properties
You can access **Tab properties** in solution explorer. Under **Components**, expand **Entities**, expand the entity you want, and then select **Forms**. In the list of forms, open the form of type **Main**. Then double-click inside one of the tabs on the form canvas to view tab properties.

 The following table shows properties that may be set for tabs on the form:

## Add a tab for document management
Adding a custom tab on an entity main form to display SharePoint documents helps users discover and use the SharePoint integration features that are available in a model-driven app. 

The link below points to an article that shows you how to add a tab to display SharePoint documents using the PowerApps maker portal. You can use similar steps to add a tab to display SharePoint documents using solution explorer. <br />
