# Manage access to apps using security roles

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-on-premises](../includes/applies-to-on-premises.md)] [Share a model-driven app using Power Apps](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/share-model-driven-app) 

You can choose what users see and access from the **My Apps** page or the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] home page by giving app access to specific security roles. Users will have access to apps based on the security roles they're assigned to.  
  
1. Go to **Settings** > **My Apps**.  
  
2. In the lower-right corner of the app tile you want to manage access for, select **More options** (**...**), and then select **Manage Roles**.  
  
3. Enter the following in the **Manage Roles** dialog box:  
  
   a. **App URL Suffix**: The URL you chose while creating the app is shown here by default. You can enter another app URL suffix, if you want to create an easy-to-remember URL for the app. This is optional. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Create or edit an app](../customize/create-edit-app.md).
    
   You cannot export or import the app URL suffix through a solution at this time. 
    
   b. **Roles**: Choose whether you want to give app access to all security roles or selected roles. If you choose **Give access only to these roles**, select the specific security roles.  

     ![Manage security roles for the app.](../customize/media/app-manage-roles.png "Manage security roles for the app")

   c. Select **Save**.  
  
4. Refresh the **My Apps** page.  
  
5. Go to the **Apps Being Edited** view, and publish the app again.  

For more information about security roles, see [Security roles and privileges](../admin/security-roles-privileges.md).
