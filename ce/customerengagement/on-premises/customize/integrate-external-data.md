# Integrate external data

The topics in this section explain how you can integrate data from sources outside of [!INCLUDE [pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].

- Virtual entities. A virtual entity is a custom entity in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) that has fields containing data from an external data source. More information: [Create and edit virtual entities](create-edit-virtual-entities.md)
- Alternate keys. With alternate keys, you can have an efficient and accurate way of integrating data from external systems. This is especially important in cases when an external system doesn’t store the record IDs (GUIDs) that uniquely identify records. [Define alternate keys to reference records](define-alternate-keys-reference-records.md)
