# Edit filter criteria of a view

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-on-premises](../includes/applies-to-on-premises.md)] [Edit filter criteria and change sort order in model-driven app views](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/edit-filter-criteria)

<a name="BKMK_EditFilterCriteria"></a>   

Along with the columns displayed in a view, the filter criteria applied to a view is a critical part of the value provided by the view.  
  
1. When you create or edit the view, select **Edit Filter Criteria**.  
  
2. The dialog shows a user interface similar to **Advanced Find**. You can use **AND** and **OR** clauses to specify and group criteria.  
  
3. Select **OK** to close the **Edit Filter Criteria** dialog box.
