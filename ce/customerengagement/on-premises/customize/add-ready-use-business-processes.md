# Add ready-to-use business processes for common scenarios



> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ready-to-use business processes available through the Add Ready-to-Use Business Processes setting has been deprecated and will be removed in a future major release of Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises). You can find ready-to-use business processes on [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/).

Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) includes several ready-to-use business processes for common sales, service, and marketing scenarios – to help you ensure that staff follow consistent steps every time they work with customers.  
  
 Before you can use these processes, you need to add them to the system.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Ready-to-use business processes are activated automatically when you add them. If a ready-to-use business process includes workflows or portable business logic rules, you’ll need to activate those separately. For more information about business processes, see [Create custom business logic through processes](../customize/guide-staff-through-common-tasks-processes.md).  
  
 The following table shows a list of ready-to-use business processes and what they help you do.
