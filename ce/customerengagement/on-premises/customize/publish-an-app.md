# Publish an app using the app designer

Publish an app to make it available to users.  
  
 After you've added components, validated, and saved the app, on the command bar, select **Publish**. You can also publish the app from the app tile on the My Apps page. In the **Apps Being Edited** view, in the lower right corner of the app tile you want to publish, select the **More options** button (**...**), and then select **Publish**.  
  
 The app status changes to **Published**. You can see this in the top-right corner of the app designer. The app moves from the **Apps Being Edited** view to the **Published Apps** view, and the published date is shown on the app tile.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> - If your app has a validation error, you'll see the error on a notification bar. You won't be able to publish the app until you resolve the error.  
> - You can't publish an app until you save it.
