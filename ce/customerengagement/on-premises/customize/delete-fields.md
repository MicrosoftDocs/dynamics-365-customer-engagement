# Delete a custom field

 As someone with the system administrator security role, you can delete any custom fields that arenâ€™t part of a managed solution. When you delete a field, any data stored in the field is lost. The only way to recover data from a field that was deleted is to restore the database from a point before the field was deleted.  
  
 Before you can delete a custom field, you must remove any dependencies that may exist in other solution components. Open the field and use the **Show Dependencies** button in the menu bar to view any **Dependent Components**. For example, if the field is used in a form or view, you must first, remove references to the field in those solution components.  
  
 If you delete a lookup field, the 1:N entity relationship for it will automatically be deleted.
