# Navigate to a specific solution
[!INCLUDE [applies-to-on-premises](../includes/applies-to-on-premises.md)] [Navigate to a specific solution](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/navigate-specific-solution)

If your organization already has a specific solution you should work in, this is how you can find it. To create a new solution, see [Create your own solution](../customize/create-solution.md).  
  
## Open an unmanaged solution  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_customization](../includes/proc-settings-customization.md)]  
  
2. Choose **Solutions**.  
  
3. Double-click the unmanaged solution that you want to work in to open it.  
  
   When you’re in the solution, you’ll see solution components. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Add Solution Components](../customize/solutions-overview.md)
