# Use sites to manage your service locations

## Introduction

Create sites to define the locations where you provide service to your customers. When you’re scheduling resources, you can define which resources will work on which site.

You can also create a site in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) 9.1 also. More information: [New features in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises)](/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/whats-new#support-for-site-entity-in-unified-interface)
