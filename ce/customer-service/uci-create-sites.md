# Use sites to manage your service locations

Create sites to define the locations where you provide service to your customers. When you’re scheduling resources, you can define which resources will work on which site.

## Create a site

Before you begin, make sure you have the System Administrator or System Customizer security role or equivalent permissions.

1. Navigate to **Customer Service Hub** > **Scheduling** tab.

2. Select **Sites**

   ![Select Sites](media/uci-site-scheduling.png "Select Sites on the Scheduling tab")

3. Select **New.**

   ![New site](media/uci-new-site.png "Enter a name and other details for the new site")

4. Enter a name and any other details you want, and then click **Save**.
