# Quickstart: Build your own Connected Customer Service (IoT) solution

This article shows you how to get up and running quickly to build your own Connected Customer Service solution that integrates IoT data with Dynamics 365 Customer Service.

## What is Connected Customer Service?
Connected Customer Service enables businesses to actively look for issues with customers' devices through IoT signals and proactively resolve those issues, simultaneously increasing customer satisfaction and reducing assisted support service costs.   

## What you need to get started

Here are the 3 things you need to get started building your own IoT solution:

- **Dynamics 365 Customer Service with system administrator credentials** 

     You'll need a Dynamics 365 Customer Service tenant so that you can import your IoT solution on top of it. You'll build an IoT app within that Customer Service tenant.  

     New to Customer Service and need a tenant? No worries. [Sign up for a free trial for development purposes.](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-365/mscrm.40fd37ef-dca4-4b0d-9f41-d16703b7d070
)

- **Azure subscription with admin credentials**     

    The Azure IoT services you'll deploy need to be associated with an Azure subscription.

- **Dynamics 365 Connected Customer Service add-on**  

    The free Connected Customer Service add-on automatically provisions a number of Azure IoT services with predefined demo data seamlessly on top of Dynamics 365 Customer Service. The add-on comes with demo data that enables you to see the capabilities IoT data brings to Customer Service, including command modeling, customer asset to device mapping, IoT alert – to – case workflow, and more.
