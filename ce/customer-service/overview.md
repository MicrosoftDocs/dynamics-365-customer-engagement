# Overview of Customer Service and the Customer Service Hub

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Welcome to [!include[](../includes/pn-ms-dyn-365-for-customer-service.md)]!

[//]: # (Style Guide says it's okay to use "with" when we're talking in a friendly way about what people can do with our products, so I suggest "with" instead of "by using" here.)
Build great customer relationships by focusing on optimum customer satisfaction with the Customer Service apps. Customer Service provides many features and tools that organizations can use to manage the services they provide to customers.   

Use [!include[](../includes/pn-ms-dyn-365-for-customer-service.md)] to:

- Track customer issues through cases.
- Record all interactions related to a case.
- Share information in the knowledge base.
- Create queues, and route cases to the right channels.
- Create and track service levels through service level agreements (SLAs). 
- Define service terms through entitlements.
- Manage performance and productivity through reports and dashboards.
- Create and schedule services.

 
##   Available anywhere, on any device
There are two flavors of [!include[](.../includes/pn-ms-dyn-365-for-customer-service.md)]:

- The Customer Service app is available on a desktop browser for case management, but not for managing knowledge articles. [!include[](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [User guide for Customer Service](user-guide-customer-service.md)

- The Customer Service Hub app is available to use on a desktop browser and on a mobile device for managing knowledge articles and case management.  [!include[](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [User guide for Customer Service Hub](user-guide-customer-service-hub.md)

    The Customer Service Hub app is built on the Unified Interface framework, which uses responsive web design principles to provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience for any screen size, device, or orientation. Using Customer Service Hub on a desktop browser for tasks other than managing knowledge articles is not recommended. 

> [!NOTE]
> For mobile devices, you'll also need to [Install Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets](../mobile-app/Install-Dynamics-365-for-phones-and-tablets.md).

If you're using a desktop browser, you'll see the Customer Service app and the Customer Service Hub app in the app switcher as shown here:

![open-sitemap](media/open-csh-sitemap-overview.png "Customer Service Hub sitemap")

If you're using a mobile device with Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets installed, you'll see the Customer Service Hub app in the app switcher as shown here:

> [!NOTE]
> Looking forward to upgrade to the Customer Service Hub app? See the blog [Upgrade to the Customer Service Hub in Microsoft Dynamics 365](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/crm/2018/02/16/upgrade-from-interactive-service-hub-to-the-customer-service-hub-in-microsoft-dynamics-365-online-version-9-0/)

## Accessibility and GDPR in the Customer Service Hub 

Customer Service Hub is committed towards inclusive design and accessible content. The app is designed around accessibility so that all users can be effortlessly productive.

For more details about the app's accessibility and GDPR compliance, see [Accessibility and GDPR](user-guide-customer-service-hub.md#accessibility-and-gdpr).

## Set up Customer Service or Customer Service Hub

Easily set up the Customer Service app and the Customer Service Hub app by using the [Service Manager Guide](service-manager-guide.md).  

The Service Manager Guide helps you set up everything related to customer service, like defining parent-child case hierarchy, creating queues, routing rule sets, rules for automatic case creation, service level agreements (SLAs), entitlements, and customer service schedule.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have previously installed any portal solution, to create a case in the Customer Service Hub or to use the Merge cases command, you must turn off the **Read-only in mobile** option for the Case entity. More information: [Turn off Read-only in mobile option](../customize/edit-entities.md#enable-or-disable-entity-options).
