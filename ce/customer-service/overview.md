We believe that knowing your customers enables you to personalize each experience and optimizes your agents' productivity so you can earn customers for life. 

The agent experience is the heart of Dynamics 365 Customer Service. The key to improving satisfaction in service delivery is enabling agents to take customer requests from any channel, handle multiple sessions at a time, interact with multiple apps without losing context, and enhance their workflow with productivity tools.
