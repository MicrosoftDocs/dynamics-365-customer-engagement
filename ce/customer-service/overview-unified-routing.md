# Overview of unified routing

Unified routing is an intelligent, scalable, and enterprise grade routing and assignment capability that can assign the incoming work item to the best suited queue and agent by adhering to work item requirements and matching them with the agent’s capabilities.

Unified routing helps assign incoming work items from different channels. It works in a truly omnichannel way ensuring work items on all the channels are routed in a consistent and similar manner and thus the agent engagement on different channels is respected before any new work is assigned to them.

Unified routing has two main stages – classification and assignment. In the classification stage, rules and machine learning (ML) models can be used to add information on the work item, which can be further used to find the best suited agent.

During the assignment phase, the service requests are prioritized and then assigned to the agents based on the nature of the work, customer journey, agent skills, and the current state of the agent workforce in terms of availability and workload.

For instance, an organization receiving an incoming chat will add information on the work item, like skills required, urgency level, category of customer, and importance level in the classification stage, based on certain conditions that are met as part of the configured rules. In assignment stage, an organization might want to first prioritize the incoming chats based on highest urgency level and importance, and then assign them to the agents by matching the skills required, current workload status, and availability.
