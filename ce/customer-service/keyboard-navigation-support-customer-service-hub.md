# Keyboard navigation support for the Customer Service Hub

Microsoft is committed to making its products and services easier for everyone to use.

The Customer Service Hub app is based in Unified Interface. To see the list of keyboard shortcuts that apply to an app based on Unified Interface, see [Use keyboard shortcuts in Dynamics 365 Customer Service applications](../basics/keyboard-shortcuts.md).
