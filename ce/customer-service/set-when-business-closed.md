# Set when your business is closed (Customer Service)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Prevent scheduling resources on holidays and other nonworking days by defining business closures in [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)]. You can set both the days and times that your organization will be closed. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Service scheduling has been deprecated. For more information, see [Important changes coming](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/get-started/whats-new/customer-engagement/important-changes-coming).
  
1. Make sure you have the Schedule Manager Security role or equivalent permissions to update the business closures.  
  
   #### Check your security role  
  
   - [!INCLUDE[proc_follow_steps_in_link](../includes/proc-follow-steps-in-link.md)]  
  
   - [!INCLUDE[proc_dont_have_correct_permissions](../includes/proc-dont-have-correct-permissions.md)]  
  
2. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_service_management](../includes/proc-settings-service-management.md)]  
  
3. Click **Business Closure**.  
  
4. To create a new business closure, on the command bar, click **New**.  
  
    -OR-  
  
    To edit an existing business closure record, open it from the list.  
  
5. In the **Schedule a Business Closure** dialog box, type or modify information in the text boxes:  
  
   1. In the **Name** box, type a name that describes the purpose of the closure.  
  
       The first 12 characters of the name appear on each day of the closure on the calendar view of the affected resource's **Work Hours**.  
  
   2. In the **Start Time** and **End Time** boxes, enter the start and end date for the closure.  
  
   3. If you want to enter duration instead of an end time, select the length of the closure in the **Duration** box. [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] automatically calculates the end time for you.  
  
   4. If the closure is an all-day event, select the **All Day Event** check box. [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] automatically enters the duration of *1 day*.  
  
       If you want to enter a specific time period, clear the **All Day Event** check box. You can then specify the hours during which your organization will be closed.  
  
6. To save this business closure, click **OK**.
