# Use Facebook channel

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

## Facebook channel overview

When you sign in to Omnichannel for Customer Service, you can see your work items in Omnichannel Agent Dashboard. To learn more, see [View agent dashboard and agent conversations (work items)](oc-agent-dashboard.md).

## Prerequisite

Make sure your administrator has configured a Facebook channel.

### Incoming Facebook notification

You'll receive a notification when a customer requests a Facebook conversation. Accepting the Facebook request starts a session and you'll see the communication panel in which you can exchange messages with the customer.

## Send and receive file attachments

You can send file attachments to customers during a Facebook channel conversation. Before you send a file, make sure you understand the file size limit and file extension types set by your administrator. 

You can see the files that you receive from a customer on the communication panel. To view the file, select it and save it to your computer. The file name you see on an image that was sent by a customer might not reflect the actual file name, but a randomly generated number.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
   > ![Facebook attachment](media/fb-receive-file1.png "Facebook attachment")

If a customer sends an unsupported file extension type, you will see an error message in the communication panel: **Error: Customer sent an unsupported message type**.

### Send a file

To send a file, follow these steps:

1. Select the ellipsis (...) in the communication panel.

2. Select **Attach file**. A window will be displayed.

3. Browse and select the file to send it.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Send a file](media/fb-attach.png "Send a file")
