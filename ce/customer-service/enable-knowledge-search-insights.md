# Manage knowledge analytics

The Knowledge analytics dashboard is designed to provide your supervisors and knowledge workers with valuable insights into how your support agents are searching and using knowledge articles.

By default, the Knowledge analytics dashboard is enabled for the System Administrator, Knowledge Manager, and CSR Manager roles. To configure user roles to access analytics and dashboards, see [Configure user access to analytics and dashboards](configure-customer-service-analytics-insights-csh.md#configure-user-access-to-analytics-and-dashboards).


> [!NOTE]
> Knowledge analytics provides data that's based on internal knowledge search and doesn't provide information about customer search behavior.
