# View the agent calendar (preview)

As an agent, it's helpful to know your work schedule. If your administrator has enabled the calendar view, you can quickly see your work hours, non-work hours, and any time-off you've scheduled. The calendar view is read-only and includes daily, weekly, and monthly views. It also has an agenda view lets you see a list-type view of your schedule. 

1. In Customer Service workspace, select the **Customer Service Agent Dashboard** page from the **System Dashboards** dropdown menu.

1. In the site map, select the plus (+) icon, and then select **My Schedule** from the dropdown menu.
