Welcome to Dynamics 365 for Customer Service. Visit this page to learn about new or updated features for Customer Service.

Customer Engagement apps version 9.1 introduces some new features for enhanced customer satisfaction by facilitating improved operational efficiency and organizational productivity.

### Advanced similarity rules to view similar case suggestions

With the help of advanced similarity rules, you can now view cases similar to your current case and resolve customer issues in the first contact and within minimal time.

Using Relevance search mechanism, you can leverage keywords or key phrases in a service case to quickly find related cases and use them to resolve your current case.

### Service scheduling powered by Universal Resource Scheduling 
Service scheduling, now built atop Universal Resource Scheduling (URS), provides an efficient way to schedule resources for service activity. It considers the availability of employees, facilities, and equipments to plan schedules accordingly. It also helps to improve service quality by preventing over-scheduling.

To learn more about the new scheduling in Customer Service, see [Service scheduling overview](basics-service-service-scheduling.md).

Have some questions? See the [Service Scheduling FAQ](service-scheduling-faq.md).

### Relevance search enabled for knowledge management 

Knowledge base search control in Customer Service is now powered by Relevance search to deliver results with improved performance and accuracy. With this feature, agents can search and choose the most relevant articles quickly with the help of highlighted search term matches in the results list. 

To learn more about how knowledge base search control works with Relevance search, see [Search for knowledge articles](search-knowledge-articles-csh.md).

To learn more about Relevance search, see [Use Relevance Search for faster, comprehensive search results](../basics/relevance-search-results.md).

### Enhanced customer service admin settings using Service Management

With the Customer Engagement apps version 9.1 release, Service Management moves under the Customer Service Hub, enabling customer service managers to access and manage the configurations from inside the application. Built on the Unified Interface framework, the new Service Management helps to easily configure admin settings, enabling increased productivity.

See the [Service Manager Guide (Customer Service Hub and Customer Service app)](service-manager-guide.md) to learn more about Customer Service admin settings.

> [!NOTE]
> With the Customer Engagement apps version 9.1 release, you can access and manage all admin settings from the Customer Service Hub sitemap except for **Routing Rule sets**, **Automatic Record Creation,** and **Service Level Agreements**. </br> To access and manage these three admin settings, go to **Settings** > **Service Management** in the web application.
