# Add facilities and equipment for service scheduling (Customer Service)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Facilities and equipment are resources you’d use to perform services for your customers. Facilities can be physical spaces like service bays or conference rooms and equipment could be tools or other assets. Add these resources to [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] to ensure optimal services to your customers.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Service scheduling has been deprecated. For more information, see [Important changes coming](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/get-started/whats-new/customer-engagement/important-changes-coming).

    - **Site**. Select the location where the facility or equipment is located.  
  
        > [!TIP]
        >  Make sure the site and the customer are in the same location. Resources for a given service activity should also be located at the same site.  
  
    - **Primary Email**. Enter the email address of the site manager or equipment manager. If there are any updates or cancellations related to the schedule, facilities, or equipment, notifications are sent to this email address.

By default, this is set to the time zone you’ve selected in the **General** tab of the **Set Personal Options** dialog box.
