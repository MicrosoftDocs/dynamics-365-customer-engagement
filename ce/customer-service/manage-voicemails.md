# Manage voicemails

As an agent, you can access the voicemails recorded by customers on your direct inward dial number or through work items that have been routed to you.

## Manage the voicemails that you receive

You can view the voicemails in one of the following ways:

- On the **Customer Service Agent Dashboard**, in **My Open Activities**, select the vertical ellipses, and then select **Other Activities** > **Voicemail**.
- On the **Omnichannel Agent Dashboard**, in **Open work items**, select the vertical ellipses for your number, and then select **Assign to me**.
- If an inbox is configured for you, you can view the assigned and unassigned voicemails. Go to your inbox, and select **Assigned voicemails**, and then select the voicemail that you want to hear. If you access an unassigned voicemail and then close it, you won't be able to access it again.

You can do the following tasks for the voicemail that you open:

- **Regarding**: Set the regarding of the voicemail.
- **Customer**: If the customer isn't automatically identified, set the customer of the voicemail.
- **Save**: Save changes to the voicemail. Some settings require an explicit save action.
- **Close Voicemail**: Moves the voicemail to the closed state.
- **Return Call**: Displays a dialer with the customer number automatically filled in if you have outbound profiles configured. More information: [Outbound profiles](configure-outbound-inbound-profiles.md)
- **Add to Queue**: Add the voicemail to a different queue. If the voicemail is routed to a pick workstream, it will be available as a pick item in the new queue.  If the voicemail is routed to a push workstream, it will be assigned to an agent in the new queue.
- **Call Recording**: Select the tab to view the original voice call recording that preceded the voicemail. If the call goes straight to voicemail and the customer didn't talk to a bot, a recording or transcript won't be available on this tab.  Additionally, if your voice workstream was set to  have transcription only and the customer talked to a bot, you won't see a call recording here, only the transcript will be available.
- **Download audio**: Select to download the voicemail.
- **Share**: Select to email or copy the link to the voicemail. You can also manage the user access to the voicemail.
