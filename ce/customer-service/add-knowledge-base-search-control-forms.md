# Add the Knowledge Base Search control to forms

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Add a **Knowledge Base Search** control to [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] forms to make it easy for users in your organization to find knowledge articles so they can answer common customer questions and resolve their issues right from the records, without having to switch to a different application.  
  
 You can configure the Knowledge Base Search control to:  
  
-   Show automatic suggestions in search results based on certain fields, or based on text analytics. The text analytics feature in only available for [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)].  
  
-   Define filters that users can use on search results.  
  
-   Choose from a set of predefined contextual actions the users can take on an article  
  
-   Add the control on any section of any entity that is enabled for knowledge management, including the timeline, and also in custom entities. The control is added by default to the case form of type **Main**. The control can be added to other Main forms also.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  The Knowledge Base Search control can be used on Microsoft Dynamics 365 for tablets and phones. However, some actions like Pop Out, Email Link, and Email Content aren't supported.  

Microsoft Dynamics 365 supports the native Dynamics 365 knowledge management. This option is available for Dynamics 365 online users.
  
## Prerequisites  
 Before you add the Knowledge Base Search control, make sure to:  
  
-   Set up knowledge management in [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)]. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Set up knowledge management](set-up-knowledge-management.md)
  
-   Select the entity you want to enable knowledge management on while setting up knowledge management.  

> [!NOTE]
> All customization tasks for the Customer Service Hub must be done in the Microsoft Dynamics 365 web application.

1. [!INCLUDE[proc_permissions_system_admin_and_customizer](../includes/proc-permissions-system-admin-and-customizer.md)]  
  
2. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_customization](../includes/proc-settings-customization.md)]

7.  Select the area where you want to place the search control, and on the **Insert** tab, select **Knowledge Base Search**.  
  
     If the option to add Knowledge Base Search is disabled, it could be because knowledge management isn’t set up or isn’t enabled for the entity you’re adding the search control to.

|     |  Set Default Language |     If you want users to see search results only for articles in a specific language, in the **Set Default Language** drop-down list, select a language. By default, User’s Default Language is selected: <br><ul><li>If you select User's Default Language, search results will be filtered based on the signed-in user's default language. </li> <li> If the language you select isn't an active language, the search results will be filtered using the signed in user's default language. </li> <li> If you select User's Default Language, and if the user's default language isn't an active language, the first active language available alphabetically is used as the default filter. </li> <li>	To let user’s select a different language filter on search results so they can see other articles in other languages, select the **Users can change Language Filter** check box.
