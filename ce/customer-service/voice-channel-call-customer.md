# Call a customer

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

To be able to call customers, your administrator must configure outbound calling, add you as user to the outbound capacity profile, and then set up outbound profiles. More information: [Outbound calling](voice-channel-outbound-calling.md)

1. In Omnichannel for Customer Service, go to **Contacts**, and then select a customer to call.

1. On the Customer Summary page, locate the **Mobile Phone** field, and then select the call icon to call the customer.
   The phone dialer opens with the phone number.
   
    You can also select the **Launch dialer** phone icon on the menu bar to quickly call a customer. On the number pad that appears, enter the customer's country code, phone number, and then select **Call** to make your call. You don't have to add the plus sign (+) to the number.

1. Select **Call** on the phone dialer.


In the **Call** dropdown list, you'll see the phone number that you're using to make the call. This is the outbound calling number that'll be displayed on the customer's phone when they receive your call.

When the call connects, you'll see the customer details on the conversation page. Based on your outbound calling profile, the transcription and recording starts. If your capacity profile has a limit of one outbound call at a time, you won't be able to make another call when a call is in progress.

> [!NOTE]
> If you need more trial minutes or phone numbers, we recommend that you file a request with Microsoft Support.
