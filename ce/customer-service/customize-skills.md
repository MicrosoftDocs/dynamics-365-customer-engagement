# How to customize skills on any form

Dynamics 365 ships a control that you can embed in any of your forms. 
Say you have a case form where you want to add a **Skills** control, here are the steps to add the skill update control on the case form:

1. In Dynamics 365, go to Advanced Settings > Customizations > Customize the System.
2. On the Solutions: Default Solutions pane, select Components > Entities. Expand Entities, navigate to Case entity, as that's what we want to customize. Expand Case and select Forms.
