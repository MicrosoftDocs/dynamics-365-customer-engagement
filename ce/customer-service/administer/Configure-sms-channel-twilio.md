# Configure an SMS channel for Twilio

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes](../../includes/cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes.md)]

The SMS channel through Twilio allows your organization to connect to customers by using text messages. Your customers can send text messages through Twilio and connect with an appropriate customer service agent. Agents can view incoming SMS requests on their dashboard and respond accordingly.

## Prerequisites

Make sure that the following prerequisites are met:

- SMS for Twilio is provisioned in the Customer Service admin center or Contact Center admin center application. More information: [Provision channels](/dynamics365/contact-center/implement/provision-channels#set-up-channels) 
 
- A Twilio account with a phone number and subscription is available.
    > [!NOTE]
    > > For new Twilio accounts, you must disable a security setting that blocks media files. More information: [Extended notice and update on security changes: HTTP Authentication for Voice and Messaging Media enabled by default](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2248938)
- Permissions on the secure columns. More information: [Configure permissions to access secure columns](../implement/add-users-assign-roles.md#configure-permissions-to-access-secure-columns)

### Get Twilio account details

An SMS channel is enabled within the application that's integrated with Twilio. This integration uses public APIs of Twilio to send and receive text messages.

1. In your Twilio account, note the ACCOUNT SID and AUTH TOKEN values. These values are required to create the SMS configuration in the Customer Service admin center app.

2. Purchase support phone numbers through your Twilio account.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - US phone numbers only are supported.
> - To ensure that third-party SMS providers handle opt-out commands properly, you must configure your consent settings with the provider directly.

## Establish a connection between omnichannel application and Twilio


Perform the following steps to configure the URL in Twilio for the SMS messages from the omnichannel application to be processed in Twilio:

1. Copy the value in **Twilio inbound URL** of the workstream for Twilio.

2. Go to your Twilio account > **Phone Numbers** > **Active Numbers**, and then select the SMS phone number.

3. In the **Messaging** section, paste the Twilio inbound URL.

## Flow of data between omnichannel application and Twilio

### Incoming text messages

For an incoming text message sent by a customer to the support phone number, the message is first sent to the Twilio messaging service. Then Twilio pushes it to omnichannel application by using the callback URL. The message is then routed and associated to either a new or an existing conversation by the application.

### Outgoing text messages

For an outgoing message sent by an agent from within the application, the message is first sent to the Twilio service and then Twilio sends it to the customer. In addition to the text message, the application uses the APIs provided by Twilio to send the customer's phone number, support phone number, and the Twilio account information (Account SID and the Auth Token) to the Twilio service.

### Twilio account and phone number validation

When you validate the SMS settings while setting up the SMS channel, a call is made to Twilio to validate the Account SID and Auth Token.
