# Overview of Community

Welcome to Dynamics 365 Customer Service Community, a new app that offers a suite of capabilities that are designed to help your organization invite customer suggestions and crowd source portfolios of outside-in ideas. Community can help fuel your business transformation, build customer trust with process transparency, and drive timely follow-up for suggestions. 

In addition to providing feedback to organizations, end users use Community to collaborate on a social scale, and rally behind suggestions from others to help shape the future of the products they use.
