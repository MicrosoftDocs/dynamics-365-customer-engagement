# Overview of Community

Dynamics 365 Customer Service Community provides capabilities that help organizations invite customer suggestions and crowdsource ideas. Community enables organizations to collaborate with customers at scale, capture feedback, and track ideas through a transparent, closed loop process. 

In addition to providing feedback to organizations, end users use Community to collaborate on a social scale, and rally behind suggestions from others to help shape the future of the products they use.

To use Customer Service Community, you must install the Customer Service Community app and provision a Community website using the Modern Community template.

   -	Configure of the modern Community portal to fit your organization brand, including colors, custom header and footer, and quick links.
   -	Enforce acceptance of your terms of use and privacy statement by end users.
   -	Create and manage idea forums.
   -	Manage content, including content moderation and merge of duplicate ideas.
   -	Update the status and respond to community feedback.
   -	Manage users and assign security roles on a forum level.

## Modern Community template

The Modern Community template provides the end-user experiences that are available out of the box. This installation lets your customers engage in the following ways:
   -	Browse, search, filter, and sort idea lists.
   -	Post new ideas. This flow includes autosuggestion of existing ideas to prevent duplicates.
