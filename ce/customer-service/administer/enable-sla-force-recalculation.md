# Enable custom recalculation of SLA KPIs

## Introduction

Time calculation in service-level agreements (SLAs) is dependent on SLA key performance indicators (KPIs) and input parameters. More information: [Time calculation of SLA KPIs](enable-sla-custom-time-calculation.md)

Changes in the associated customer service schedule and holiday schedule don't affect the existing SLA KPIs unless one of the following events occurs:  

- The SLA KPI is paused and resumed.
- The SLA on an entity instance is updated.
- The SLA item is updated.
- The SLA KPI instance is reapplied after terminal state in recalculation.  

## Enable the custom recalculation on a target entity

You can trigger the recalculation of active SLA KPI instances that have a status of either **In Progress** or **Nearing Noncompliance** and create new SLA KPIs by explicitly calling the custom action `msdyn_ManageSLAInstances` independent of the events mentioned previously.

> [!NOTE]
> This doesn't affect the SLA KPI instances that have a status of **Paused**, **Cancelled**, **Succeeded**, or **Non-compliant**.

To enable custom recalculation and create new SLA KPIs, you must set the integer value of the **Recalculate** parameter to **1** through custom plug-in code. By default, the integer value of the **Recalculate** parameter is **0**. You can set the integer value by creating custom plug-in code on the SLA's target entity and implementing the custom logic based on which the custom action will be initiated. More information: [Write a plug-in](/powerapps/developer/data-platform/write-plug-in)

For example, if you want to recalculate the SLA KPIs that have a status of **In progress** or **Nearing Noncompliance**, on updating the **Case Type** field on the Case entity, you'll need to create a custom plug-in and register it on the Case update for the **Case Type** field. On updating the **Case Type** field, you'll need to call the custom action in your custom plug-in code. The previous SLA KPI instances will be canceled, and new instances will be created.

Following is an example of the plug-in code:

``` OrganizationRequest customEvaluation = new OrganizationRequest("msdyn_ManageSLAInstances");
customEvaluation["SLAId"] = "<sla id>";
customEvaluation["RegardingId"] = <case id>;
customEvaluation["EntityLogicalName"] = "incident";//logical name of case entity
customEvaluation["Recalculate"] = 1;

OrganizationResponse customEvaluationResponse = service.Execute(customEvaluation);

```
