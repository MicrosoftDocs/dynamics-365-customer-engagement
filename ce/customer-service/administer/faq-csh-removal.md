# Customer Service Hub app removal and migration FAQ

This article contains frequently asked questions about the removal of the Customer Service Hub app for new organizations with Enterprise licenses and migration to Customer Service workspace.

## Why is the Customer Service workspace app replacing Customer Service Hub for new organizations with Enterprise licenses?

Customer Service workspace offers improved agent efficiency as a multisession app with a browser-like, tabbed experience in a single window. In contrast, Customer Service Hub is a single-session app that requires agents to open multiple browser windows to manage their work items.

Customer Service workspace improves the ability for agents to respond to email, chats, and messages from configured social media channels, and calls. Agents can view and filter their conversations and work items in an Outlook-style inbox. Administrators can create custom inbox views to meet the needs of their organizations.

You can reap the benefits of using Microsoft Copilot out of the box without the need for extra configuration in Customer Service workspace. When administrators enable Copilot, agents can use the following features:
 
 - Summarize cases with Copilot
 - Summarize conversations with Copilot
 - Ask Copilot questions
 - Draft email replies using Copilot

## What does removal mean?

Removal means Microsoft plans to remove a feature or app after on a specific date. In this case, as of February 2025, the Customer Service Hub app will no longer be available for all new organizations with Enterprise licenses. We continue to support the application for all existing organizations and new customers who have other license types other than Enterprise (for example, Customer Service Professional licenses). However, we recommend that all existing customers migrate to Customer Service workspace

## Can I continue to use the Customer Service Hub app?

Yes. If you're already using Customer Service Hub, you can continue to use it. As of July 12, 2024, new customers can only deploy Customer Service workspace in their enterprise environments. We continue to support the application for all existing organizations and new customers who have other license types other than Enterprise (for example, Customer Service Professional licenses).

## Since Customer Service Hub is no longer available to new enterprise organizations, what app should I use?

You can use the Customer Service workspace app.

## I'm an existing enterprise customer and still need to use Customer Service Hub. How do I enable it?

If you're an existing customer and need to set up Customer Service Hub in your enterprise environment for testing purposes, complete the steps in [Enable the Customer Service Hub app](../implement/customer-service-hub-user-guide-basics.md#enable-the-customer-service-hub-app).
