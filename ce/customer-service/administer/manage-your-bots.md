# Manage your bots in Omnichannel for Customer Service

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes](../../includes/cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes.md)]


[!INCLUDE[pva-rebrand](../../includes/cc-pva-rebrand.md)]

In Omnichannel for Customer Service, you can seamlessly add a bot and get it up and running within a few minutes while the integration is taken care of in the background.

You can manage your Copilot Studio bots on the **Bots** page.

## Prerequisites

Copilot Studio bots must be available in the tenant where Omnichannel for Customer Service is available.

## Add a bot

When you add a bot by using the steps outlined in this section, the Copilot Studio bot is automatically registered in Azure and connected to Omnichannel for Customer Service. You'll then configure topics in Copilot Studio for the scenarios that you want the bot to handle.

> [!NOTE]
> Bots that you create in Customer Service admin center or Contact Center admin center work with enhanced voice workstreams only. To create classic bots for existing voice workstreams that aren't migrated, use Copilot Studio.

1. In admin center, select **Bots** under **Customer support**.
1. On the **Bots** page, select **Add**, and on the **Add a bot** page, select **Create new bot**, and then select **Next**.
1. On the **Create a basic bot** page, enter a name for your bot and select the primary language that the bot must use, and then select **Create**. The bot is created and listed on the **Bots** page. 
1. Optionally, you can also add an existing bot if it's already created in Copilot Studio. The **Connect existing bot** option lets you connect the bot. The bot is connected after a few minutes and listed on the **Bots** page. The voice-enabled bot that you connected works with the enhanced voice workstream only.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Bots that you've created in Copilot Studio by using the [**Try the unified canvas (preview)**](/power-virtual-agents/authoring-first-bot) option won't work with the voice workstreams.

## Manage your bots

On the **Bots** page, you can review the bot details and also perform the following actions:

- Disconnect the bot.
- Select the bot name. The Copilot Studio app opens on a new tab where you can configure topics and other settings for the bot.
