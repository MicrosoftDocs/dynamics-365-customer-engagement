# Best practices to use Omnichannel for Customer Service

Use the following guidelines in Omnichannel for Customer Service, so that the data in the dashboards isn't affected:

-  Customer service representatives (service representatives or representatives) should sign out or set presence as Appear away before stepping out. This avoids the routing of conversation requests to them.

-  As an administrator or supervisor, you shouldn't configure routing rules to assign conversation requests for representatives whose presence is away or offline. This ensures that conversations from channels that require immediate attention aren't assigned to the representatives who are away or offline. 

-  Close the session in the app after the conversation with the customer is complete. This ensures that you have capacity to work on the next conversation request.
