# Check your contact center health

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes](../../includes/cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes.md)]

As administrators, you can use the integrated health checker to identify any errors, warnings, and then recommended best practices in your configuration. You can receive proactive notifications of emerging issues with health checks running in the background. This proactive approach can help ensure that your call center flows and configurations operate at optimal levels. 

## Prerequisites

You must have the System Administrator role.


## Run a check

Do the following steps to check for configuration errors and incomplete configurations in your Customer Service environment.

1. Sign into Customer Service admin center. The **Home** page displays the **Contact center health** section.
1. Select **Run health** check. Depending on the size of your contact center and the various features that you configured, the check takes a couple of minutes to run and display the results.

   After the check is complete, the page displays the results in three categories with the number of occurrences as follows:

    - Errors
    - Warnings
    - Suggestions

1. Expand a category to see the problems and then select the link to a problematic setting. The setting opens on a new tab for you to take action on it.
1. Optionally, after you resolve all the issues in the configuration, run the health check again until you see zero occurrences of errors and warnings.

### Health check rules

Some of the rules used in the health check and their descriptions are as follows.
