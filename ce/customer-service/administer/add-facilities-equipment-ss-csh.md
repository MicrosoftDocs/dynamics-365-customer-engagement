# Add facilities and equipment to schedule service

## Introduction

Facilities and equipment are resources you use to perform services for your customers. Facilities could be physical spaces like service bays or conference rooms and equipment could be tools or other assets. To ensure optimal services for your customers, add these resources to Dynamics 365 Customer Service.  

## Create a new facility or equipment record

Make sure that you have the required security role or equivalent permissions. 

Learn more in [Manage security roles in service scheduling](manage-security-roles.md).

You can create a new facility or equipment record in the Customer Service admin center app.

1. In the site map of Customer Service admin center, select **Service Scheduling** in **Operations**. The **Service Scheduling** page appears.
1. In the **Facilities & equipment** section, select **Manage**. The **Local Facilities/Equipment** view is displayed. You can switch between various system views using the dropdown list.


     
1. On the command bar, select **New** to create a new record. 
  
1.  In the **General** section, fill in the information as required:
