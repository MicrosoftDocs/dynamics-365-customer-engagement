# Customizations supported by the Conversation table and form

This article lists the customizations that you can and can't use with the **Conversation** table (`msdyn_ocliveworkitem`) and the **Conversation** form in Omnichannel for Customer Service.

## Customizations supported by the Conversation table

The following table lists the supported customizations.

| Components  | Add new?   | Edit existing?    |
|------------ | ---------  | ----------------  |
| Form        |  No        |  Yes            |
| View        |  Yes       |  No              |
| Chart       |  Yes       |  No               |
| Column      |  Yes       |  No. But you can change some properties of `msdyn_title` and `msdyn_thirdpartyconversations`. |
| Dashboard   |  No        |  No               |

You can:

- Create business rules.
- Associate a conversation with a lead or opportunity, or any other activity-enabled table via the **Regarding** column that's available for the conversation.
You can't:

You can't:

- Add a Many to Many relationship.
- Use custom columns in unified routing or assignment.

We recommend that:

- You don't add a custom column that's set as system required. If you intend to add such a custom column based on your business needs, then you populate the value for the custom column via sync pre-validation or pre-operation plug-in to ensure its value isn't null.
- You don't create alternate keys.

## Customizations supported by the Conversation form

You can customize the **Conversation** form to:

- Load the **Active Conversation** form as an application tab instead of an anchor tab in a session.
- Edit existing forms in the following ways:
  - Add custom controls. However, we recommend that you don't use custom controls to update a conversation because Omnichannel for Customer Service will overwrite the updates when the conversation ends.
  - Edit the quick view for customers and cases.
  - Add web resources and external website controls.
  - Modify the form layout, resize controls, and create tabs and sections.
  - Edit the quick view for customers and cases.
  - Move sections to different tabs.
  - Remove **Recent cases** subgrid.

Additionally, if [customize active conversation form](add-customer-summary-settings.md) is enabled, you can:

- Add subgrids on the **Conversation** form and view data for related tables in the subgrid.
- Edit existing forms in the following ways:
  - Add custom columns and allow saving of custom and standard columns on the form except some of the logical column names listed in the **Logical column** names section.
  - Add canvas apps.
  - Render columns with values on the form.
  - Configure **Customer 360** card and **Case details** card.

We also recommend that you don't:

- Change the **Conversation** form or the order in which it's displayed, as it's the default form.
- Modify the out-of-the-box JavaScript handlers and web resource used in the **Active Conversation** form.
- Remove the form initiator control from the **Search customer** and **Search issue** lookup controls.
