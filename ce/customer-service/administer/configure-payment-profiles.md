# Configure payment profiles

[!INCLUDE[pva-rebrand](../../includes/cc-pva-rebrand.md)]

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes](../../includes/cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes.md)]


You can create payment profiles to enable conversational commerce for supported channels. Once configured, your agents can help customers complete secure transactions without having to leave the messaging experience.

After you create a payment profile record, you must add it to a channel instance within a workstream's channel setup to make it work. Conversational commerce is supported for Apple Messages for Business.

## Create an Apple Messages for Business payment profile for Apple Pay

### Prerequisites

Verify that you have permissions on the secure columns. More information: [Configure permissions to access secure columns](../implement/add-users-assign-roles.md#configure-permissions-to-access-secure-columns)

Before adding an Apple Pay payment profile, make sure to complete the Apple Pay integration steps documented by Apple. More information: [Apple Pay - Apple Messages for Business](https://register.apple.com/resources/messages/msp-api-tutorial/applepay#integrating-apple-pay)

### Create an Apple Pay payment profile

1. In the site map of Customer Service admin center or Contact Center admin center app, select **Customer settings**, and then select **Manage for Payment profiles**. A list of existing records is shown.

1. Select **Add** at the top of the page to create a new record.	

1. In the **Create new payment profile** pages, provide the following details:<br>

     - On the **Channel type** page, enter a name and select Apple Messages for Business as the channel type. By default, the only channel type currently supported is Apple Messages for Business.<br>

1. On the **Details** page, provide the following information:<br>

     - **Merchant friendly name**: The customer-facing name of your business. This name is what your customer sees within the Apple Pay request. This name shouldn't be localized.<br>
     
     - **Merchant ID**: Your unique identifier assigned to your business when registering as a merchant for Apple Pay.<br>
     
     - **Merchant certificate**: A certificate associated with your merchant ID, used to secure transaction data. Apple Pay servers use the certificateâ€™s public key to encrypt payment data.<br>
     
     - **Certificate password**: The private key used to generate secure Apple Pay sessions. <br>
     
     - **Payment gateway URL**: The endpoint where payment information and requested contact information and sent to be processed.<br>
     
     - **Merchant domain URL**: The website domain associated with your Apple Pay Merchant Account. <br>
     
     - **Merchant two-letter country code**: Country codes are formatted by their ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code. Use the country code for where payments are processed. <br>
     
1. On the **Payment options** page, provide the following information:<br>
    
     - **Merchant capabilities**: The payment types you can accept. 3D Secure is required for channel support.<br>
     
     - **Supported Networks**: The networks that support transactions between your Apple Pay merchant account and card issuers.<br>

1. On the **Rich messages** page, select **Add**, and then select one or more Apple Pay rich messages to associate with this authentication setting. <br>
An Apple Pay-type rich message may be associated to more than one payment profile. This association is because each channel instance may only support one payment profile. <br>

1. Review the **Summary** page, and then select **Finish**. The authentication setting is configured.

1. Open the workstream containing the channel instance for which you want to enable Apple Pay.
