# Enable tables for queues in unified routing

Any record that you want to enable for routing needs to be enabled for queues.

## Enable a table for queues<a name="enable-entities"> </a>

1. In [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/), select the environment that contains your solution.

2. Select **Tables** and then select the required table such as **Account** or **Email** for which you want to enable queues.

5. In **Table properties**, select **Properties**.

6. Select **Advanced options**, and then select **Can be added to a queue** in the **Rows in this table** section.

7. Select **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
>- You can't disable the table, if you enable it for a queue. The app disables the **Can be added to a queue** checkbox after you select it.
>- If you enable the option **When the rows are created or assigned, move them to the owner's default queue**, in the table customization, then the record won't be automatically distributed to the agents. You must clear the checkbox to automatically distribute the records.
