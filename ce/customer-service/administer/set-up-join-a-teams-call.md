# Set up Join a Teams call for agents

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]

Join a Teams call is a feature that helps agents in your organization give their customers a more personalized support experience by using Teams to share their screen, connect through video, and offer remote control assistance. Customers donâ€™t need to have a Teams license or previous experience using Teams.

This feature is turned on by default in Customer Service workspace or Contact Center workspace.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

- In Power Platform admin center, go to **Settings** > **Product** > **Collaboration**, and then turn on the setting for **End users can join Teams meetings from appointments**. 
- Agents in your organization must be able to access and use Teams.
- Agents must be able to access the productivity pane to see the Join a Teams call app. More information: [Assign templates and enable the productivity pane and channels](create-agent-experience-profile.md#assign-users-templates-configure-productivity-pane-channels)
- If you want agents to be able to invite their customers to Teams meetings via email, agent email must be configured for outbound email.

## Set up the ability for agents to invite customers to join Teams calls

By default, the Join a Teams call feature is turned on out of the box in Customer Service workspace for agent profiles that have Omnichannel for Customer Service enabled.  

If you previously disabled it and need to turn it back on, start with Step 1.  

If you want to complete the configuration for custom agent profiles, start with Step 4. 
   
1. In Customer Service admin center or Contact Center admin center, go to **Agent experience** > **Collaboration**.
	
1. In **Join a Teams call**, select **Manage**.

1. On the **Join a Teams call** page, turn on the setting for **Join a Teams call**.

1. If you want to enable custom agent profiles that aren't set by default to invite customers to join Teams calls, you must manually enable it for those profiles. Select **Manage** next to **Turn on for specific multisession users.** More information: [Add the Teams chat setting page for specific multisession users](configure-teams-chat.md#add-the-teams-chat-settings-page-for-specific-multisession-users)

1. Save the changes. The Join a Teams call feature is now enabled for users in Customer Service workspace or Contact Center workspace.
