# Manage phone numbers


[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes](../../includes/cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes.md)]


You can enable and use voice and SMS services seamlessly within Dynamics 365. The voice channel comes with trial phone numbers with limited free calling time. More information: [Use trial phone numbers](voice-channel-trial-phone-numbers.md)


As an administrator, you can purchase phone numbers and calling plans, decide whether you want to avail calling and SMS services, and whether you want to set up inbound and outbound calling options for your business. You can also bring your own phone number via Azure direct routing. More information: [Bring your own carrier](voice-channel-bring-your-own-number.md)

## Prerequisites

- Check for the following criteria:
  - [Azure subscriptions eligibility](/azure/communication-services/concepts/telephony/plan-solution#azure-subscriptions-eligibility)
  - [Service limits for Azure Communication Services](/azure/communication-services/concepts/service-limits#acquiring-phone-numbers)
  - [Country or region availability](/azure/communication-services/concepts/telephony/plan-solution#countryregion-availability)
- [Deploy the voice channel](voice-channel-install.md).
- [Connect to Azure Communication Services using an existing or new Azure resource](voice-channel-acs-resource.md), and then deploy the resource through Dynamics 365.
- Verify that you have permissions on the secure columns. More information: [Configure permissions to access secure columns](../implement/add-users-assign-roles.md#configure-permissions-to-access-secure-columns)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can purchase one phone number per tenant for Azure Communication Services via the Azure Portal. However, if you want to acquire numbers in bulk or request a specific phone number, follow the instructions to create a special number request order [here](https://github.com/Azure/Communication/blob/master/special-order-numbers.md).


## View phone numbers

1. In the site map of Customer Service admin center or Contact Center admin center, select **Channels** in **Customer support**. The **Channels** page appears.

You see a list of all available phone numbers together with their carrier name, calling plan details, associated workstream, connection status, and other details.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

If you don't have any phone numbers set up for your business, see **Acquire new phone numbers** to learn how you can purchase new numbers.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If your direct routing phone number is in the inactive state, delete the number and add it again.

## Acquire new phone numbers

You can purchase new phone numbers for your organization after you check for the prerequisites, install the voice channel, and successfully connect to an Azure Communication Services resource.

1. In the site map of Customer Service admin center or Contact Center admin center, select **Channels** in **Customer support**. The **Channels** page appears.

      > [!NOTE]
      > 
      > You can only acquire United States-based phone numbers in Customer Service. If you want to acquire phone numbers from a different region, you must first purchase them through Azure Communication Services. After youâ€™ve acquired the phone numbers, you must sync them to Dynamics 365 Contact Center. For more information, see [Quickstart: Get and manage phone numbers](/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/telephony/get-phone-number) and [Sync from Azure Communication Services](voice-channel-sync-from-acs.md)

   A **Summary** with the newly allotted phone number and its details is displayed.
1. On the **Summary** page, select **Purchase phone number**. Your new phone number will be displayed after purchase and you can select **Done** to get back to the **Phone numbers** page.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Summary page.](../media/voice-channel-number-mgmt-add-summary.png "Summary page.")
  
   The new phone number is displayed in the numbers list with the status **Ready for setup**.

   > [!NOTE]
   >

1. Select **Done** to go back to the **Phone numbers** page where you can view details of the phone number that you just acquired.

 > [!NOTE]
 > - To port your phone number into an Azure Communication Services resource, see [Port a phone number](/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/telephony/port-phone-number).  
 > - You can port your Teams number in regions where Azure Communication Services is available. Use the information in [Create a Special Order for Telephone Numbers](https://github.com/Azure/Communication/blob/master/special-order-numbers.md).

## Add a phone number to a voice workstream

After you acquire a phone number, you must add it to a voice workstream to be able to use it. You can associate a phone number with only one voice workstream.

1. In the application, go to the **Phone numbers** page, and then select the phone number marked **Ready for setup** in the **Status** column.
2. Select **Setup workstream**. The **Workstreams** page with a list of all workstreams is displayed.
3. If you want to create a new workstream, select **New workstream**, and then follow the steps to [set up a voice workstream](voice-channel-inbound-calling.md#set-up-a-voice-workstream).
4. Select an existing workstream from the list.
5. Follow the steps to [configure a voice channel](voice-channel-inbound-calling.md#configure-a-voice-channel).

   The phone number is added to the workstream, and you can view the **Connected** status for the phone number on the **Phone numbers** page.

## Configure phone numbers for outbound calls

After you purchase phone numbers and associated them with voice workstreams, you can configure them for outbound calls so your customer service representatives can actually make calls to customers. More information: [Configure the phone number for outbound calling](voice-channel-outbound-calling.md#configure-phone-numbers-for-outbound-calling)

## Configure voice channel for inbound calls

You can also enable your customer service representatives to receive customer calls, create queues for the voice channel, and set up routing rules. More information: [Set up workstreams and queues for the voice channel](voice-channel-inbound-calling.md)

## Assign phone numbers to customer service representatives

You can also assign personal phone numbers to customer service representatives, so they're able to make and/or receive calls exclusively on that number. More information: [Assign personal phone numbers to customer service representatives](voice-channel-outbound-calling.md#assign-personal-phone-numbers-to-customer service representatives)

## Edit phone numbers

If you want to change the calling plan, or upgrade the calling or SMS plans on a particular number, you can do so by editing the phone number. For example, if you hadn't selected any SMS plans, you can upgrade to the **Send SMS** or **Send and receive SMS** plans; if you selected only the **Send SMS** option, you can now upgrade to the **Send and receive SMS** plans.

1. In Customer Service admin center or Contact Center admin center, go to the **Phone numbers** page. The list of the available phone numbers for your business is displayed.
1. Select a phone number and then select **Edit**. The **Edit phone number** dialog with the current plan type, calling plan, and SMS plan is displayed.
1. Make any changes to your call or SMS plans, and select **Save and Close**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - You can't upgrade a phone number or change your call or SMS plans, after it's connected to a workstream.
> - You can't remove features once granted to a phone number, but you can upgrade phone number features. For example, if you chose both **Make calls** and **Receive calls** options in your calling plans, you can't change it. However, if you selected **None** for SMS plans, you can upgrade to **Send SMS** or **Send and receive SMS** plan.

## Release phone numbers

If you no longer need a phone number, you can release it from your organization's phone number list. However, before you plan to remove the phone number from your business, you must remove the number from any associated workstreams or outbound profiles. Also, if the number is assigned as a personal number to any customer service representative, you must disable the number, and then try releasing it again.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> When you release a phone number, you actually delete it from Dynamics 365, so release a number only if you're sure that you don't need it at all.
> To disconnect phone numbers from an Azure Communication Services resource, see [Disconnect from Azure Communication Services resource](voice-channel-disconnect-from-acs.md).

1. In Customer Service admin center or Contact Center admin center, go to the **Phone numbers** page. The list of the available phone numbers for your business is displayed.
2. Select a phone number and select **Release number**. The **Release number** dialog requesting you to confirm the number deletion is displayed.
3. Select **OK** if you're sure you don't need the number. The phone number is removed from your organization and is no longer displayed in the **Phone numbers** list.
