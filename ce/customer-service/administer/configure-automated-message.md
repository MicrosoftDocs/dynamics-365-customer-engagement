# Configure automated messages

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes](../../includes/cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes.md)]

You can configure Omnichannel for Customer Service to send automated messages through a channel, such as chat, voice, SMS, or social channels. The **Automated messages** tab in each channel instance enables you to create channel-specific and locale-specific text. You can customize, deactivate, and activate customer and agent-facing messages at the channel level.
As an administrator, you can also overwrite or deactivate the preconfigured, out-of-the-box automated messages for any channel instance. The preconfigured automated message triggers are listed in [this section](#preconfigured-automated-message-triggers).

## Display a list of all automated messages

You can view a list of all agent and customer-facing automated messages in your Omnichannel for Customer Service environment.

1. In the site map of Customer Service admin center, select **Customer Settings** in **Customer support**. The **Customer settings** page appears.
1. In the **Automated messages** section, select **Manage**. The **Automated messages** page is displayed.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Display all automated messages.](../media/automated-messages-list.png "Display all automated messages")

1. Select one or more of the records to edit the language code and text. If you want to deactivate the messages, select the **Deactivate** button. If overflow conditions are configured, the default automated message is played for the overflow action if you deactivate the message that's configured for the overflow condition.

## Customize automated messages at the channel level

You can customize messages across instances within a channel. For example, you can apply a change to all Facebook accounts or all SMS numbers.

1. Select a message on the **Automated messages** page, and then select **Edit**.

2. On the **General** tab, edit the **Localized text** field, and then select **Save**.

    The message field supports the following slugs.
    
    | **Slug** | **Description** |
    |----------|-----------------|
    |{AgentName} | The full name of the agent who is assigned to the conversation. |
    |{QueueName} | The name of the queue. |

## Customize automated messages at the channel instance level

You can customize automated messages at the channel instance level. For example, you can apply a change to a specific Facebook account or a specific SMS number. If you don't create customized automated messages at the channel instance level, each instance inherits the channel-level settings.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you create customized automated messages at the channel instance level, then the channel-level settings are overwritten.

### Add custom automated messages

Complete the following steps for the channel in which you want to create custom automated messages in the Customer Service admin center app:

1. Go to the workstream, and edit the channel instance.
2. On the **Behaviors** page, select **Add message** in the **Custom automated messages** area.
3. On the **Add automated message** pane, select a trigger from the **Select a message trigger** dropdown list.
4. In the **Automated message** box, type the message that should be displayed.
5. Select **Confirm**.
6. Repeat steps 3 through 5 to create multiple messages.
7. Save the settings.

## Best practices for using automated messages

Use the following best practices when you configure automated messages for the voice channel:

- Make sure that you configure concise messages when you use automated and custom messages because lengthy messages might mean that agents take longer to connect with customers.

- Consider configuring **Greeting Message for Async Channels and Voice** instead of **Agent assigned to a conversation**.

- If you configured both **Agent assigned to a conversation** and **Greeting Message for Async Channels and Voice**, consider configuring **Greeting Message for Async Channels and Voice** to avoid the accumulation of messages in the queue.

- Disable messages that announce the average wait times, unless your business requires that customers know this information.
