# Apply authentication for search providers

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-rename](../../includes/cc-azure-ad-rename.md)]

Apply authentication for your search providers as required by your organization. If you authenticate using OAuth 2.0 with Microsoft Entra ID, you need the resource ID, client ID, and client secret from your configuration of Microsoft Entra ID authentication for your website. OAuth 2.0 only works with cloud mode.

The values of the resource ID, client ID, and client secret depend on your scenario.

- **Scenario 1:** You're using the same application for the identity provider and the client app to access the website.
  - The client ID and the resource ID are the application's application ID.
  - The client secret is the secret that you generated in the app.
  - After you configure the client app, make sure to create a new client secret in the app's **Certificates and secrets** settings.

- **Scenario 2:** You're using different applications for the identity provider and the client app.
  - The client ID is the application ID of the client app.
  - The client secret is the secret that you generated in the client app.
  - The resource ID is the application ID of the identity provider app.
