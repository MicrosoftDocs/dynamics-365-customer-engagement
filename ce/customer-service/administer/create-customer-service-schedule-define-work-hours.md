# Create customer service schedule and define the work hours

To define when your service or support team is available for providing support to customers, create a customer service schedule in Dynamics 365 Customer Service. A customer service schedule determines the business hours for each day in a week and also the weekly off. Customer Service uses these details for time tracking of service-level agreements (SLAs).  
  
For SLA time tracking, make sure you add a holiday schedule to the customer service schedule, and associate this customer service schedule to the SLA record.

You can create the service schedule and define work hours in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) 9.1 also. More information: [New features in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises)](/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/whats-new#new-work-hour-calendar-in-service-scheduling)
