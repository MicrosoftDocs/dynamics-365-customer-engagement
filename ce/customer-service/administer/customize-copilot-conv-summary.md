# Customize Copilot conversation summaries

You can customize the conversation summary generated by Copilot. Customizing conversation summaries reduces the need for agents to edit the summaries, increasing productivity and efficiency. 

## Set conversation summary format

In Customer Service admin center, perform the following steps:

1. Use one of the following navigation options: 
    - **Agent Experience** > **Productivity** > **Summaries**
    - **Operations** > **Insights** > **Summaries**
1. In **Summaries**, for **Live conversation summaries**, select the **Manage format** link. The **Manage format** pane shows the formats that the conversation summary is generated. You can select one of the following options: 
   - **Paragraph**:  Generates the summary in a single paragraph.
   - **Structured**: Generates the summary based on the information you've selected.
1. If you select **Structured**, Copilot organizes conversation summary based on the options you've specified. You can select the following options:
   - **Root Cause**
   - **Customer Issue**
   - **Troubleshooting steps**
   - **Outcome**
   - **Error codes**
   > [!NOTE]
   > The error codes you specify are samples for Copilot to find in the conversation. Copilot finds similar error codes in the conversation and include them in the summary.
   You can also arrange the order of the information in the summary by dragging the information to the required location.
1. Select the **Remove information from the summary that can't be found** toggle to not display the information that can't be found in the conversation. For example, if the customer doesn't provide an error code, the error code won't be included in the summary.

 If you've selected all the available options, here's how the agent will see the Copilot conversation summary:
