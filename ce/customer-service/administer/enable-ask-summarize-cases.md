# Enable case summaries through ask a question (preview)

Copilot can now generate case summaries in the "ask a question" side pane. Agents can view case summaries without losing context of what they're working on, and accelerate case ramp-ups, transfers, and wrap-ups. Agents can also use Copilot to obtain information about case data.
