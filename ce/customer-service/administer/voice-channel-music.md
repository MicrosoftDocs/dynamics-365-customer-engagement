# Manage phone music

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes](../../includes/cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes.md)]

> [!NOTE] 
> We recommend that you use the audio file formats that are supported by Azure Communication Services. Learn more at [Playing audio in call](/azure/communication-services/concepts/call-automation/play-action). 

You can use the out-of-the-box music files to set hold and wait tunes. You can replace them with your own music files, or even upload new ones to be used for hold or wait music in your customer calls. The hold or wait music will automatically be played on loop.

You can also configure hold and wait music for each language in each of the workstreams.

The following characteristics are applicable to the music files.

- The files can be up to 20 MB; for best experience, upload MP3 files.
- The files must have the ID3 tags so that they play successfully when the call is put on hold.
- The quality of the audio files that you upload might be reduced because audio file URLs are embedded in Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML). The telephony gateway gets Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) 16k audio bytes as part of the speech orchestration. More information: [Add recorded audio](/azure/ai-services/speech-service/speech-synthesis-markup-voice#add-recorded-audio).
- When audio files pass through public service telephone networks (PSTN), their quality might be reduced to a sample rate of 8 kHz (narrowband). While the voices in these files remain audible, the music quality isn't good. We recommend that you lower the sample rate of the music file to 8 kHz and assess whether the sound quality is good.
- Hold music files are played directly and aren't embedded in SSML.
