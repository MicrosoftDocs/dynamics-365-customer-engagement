# Overview of productivity tools

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]

The Dynamics 365 Productivity Tools app provides capabilities that help users perform day-to-day operations in a fast, efficient, and process-compliant manner and deliver value to customers.

The Dynamics 365 Productivity Tools app contains the following functionality to help with repetitive and monotonous tasks, such as greet customers and fill forms. The tool also helps with displaying AI-based suggestions for knowledge articles and similar cases to agents, and thereby helps users perform day-to-day operations in a fast, efficient, and process-compliant manner.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The productivity pane and productivity tools are not available in Omnichannel for Customer Service on Unified Service Desk.

## Macros

With macros, agents can perform repetitive, monotonous tasks—Open model-driven app forms, pre-populate fields with details, send an email to a customer, take notes, and much more—all in a single click. A macro is a set of sequential actions that tells the system how to complete a task. When an agent runs a macro, the system performs each action, and this helps save time and gives agents the freedom to handle more customer issues. Also, macros provide preciseness, clarity, and consistency to the tasks that agents perform.

## Agent scripts

Agent scripts provide guidance to agents about what to do when they get a customer issue. The scripts ensure that only accurate, company-endorsed information is being shared, while also safeguarding the organization in regard to legal-compliance issues. Agent scripts help organizations to be unified, accurate, and effective while being quick and efficient in handling customer needs.

## Smart assist

Smart assist is an intelligent assistant that provides real-time recommendations to agents, helping them take actions while interacting with customers. You can use the AI-based suggestions for knowledge articles and similar cases by enabling the feature. You can also build a custom bot to interpret the conversation context and provide suggestions to agents. These recommendation cards are displayed on the agent user interface based on the context of the current conversation.

The smart assist feature can be enabled across all channels like Chat for Dynamics 365 Customer Service, SMS, and Facebook, except entity records, making it a consistent experience for agents.

## Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams is a tool that can help agents more easily collaborate with colleagues by using the capabilities of Teams within Dynamics 365. Agents can view their chats, and with admin setup, can view chats that are relevant to certain records, also known as connected chats. Connecting all of their chats in one place helps agents work without switching context or leaving the application. Admins can also configure an optional introduction note that agents can use to provide further context when collaborating on Teams.

## Custom productivity tools (preview)

The productivity pane supports custom productivity tools developed as custom pages or Power Apps component framework controls. You can create multiple custom productivity tools and make them available to your users with agent experience profiles.
