# Access scheduling in the Customer Service Hub and Customer Service workspace

## Access scheduling in the Customer Service Hub

With the latest release of Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Scheduling is powered by Universal Resource Scheduling, and is available from the Customer Service Hub sitemap.

## Configure entity records in the new scheduling experience

Configure all your entity records in the new experience manually from the user interface. 

Make sure that you have the correct security role or equivalent permissions. Know more about security roles: [Manage security roles in service scheduling](manage-security-roles.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The admin must follow the order as given in the [Scheduling scenario](basics-service-service-scheduling.md#scheduling-scenario) while configuring entity records in the new scheduling experience.
> [!NOTE]
> All entity records can be configured from the user interface except Service Activity.
