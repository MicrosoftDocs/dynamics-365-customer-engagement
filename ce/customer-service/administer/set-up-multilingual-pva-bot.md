# Set up a multilingual agent to use in voice channel

You can configure routing rules to route voice calls to appropriate agents based on the language that your customer has selected. A multilingual contact center helps you serve global customers who want to interact with your contact center in the language of their choice. You can also set up agents as the first contact who can handle such requests.

Use Bot Framework Composer in Copilot Studio to set up a agent for a multilingual contact center.

The process for setting up the multilingual bot in Copilot Studio is as follows:

1. Create an agent in Copilot Studio.

1. Create a topic in Bot Framework Composer.

1. Configure the greeting topic in Copilot Studio.

1. Configure the transfer to agent node by using the escalate topic.

1. Configure workstreams and queues.

1. Verify the multilingual agent.

> [!NOTE]
> The [new multilingual chatbots](/power-virtual-agents/multilingual) aren't currently supported in Omnichannel for Customer Service.

## Prerequisites

- You must install Bot Framework Composer locally on the computer that you'll use to configure the multilingual bot.
- Your agent must be registered in the Azure app registration page. Note the application ID. Learn more in [Create an app registration](/azure/digital-twins/how-to-create-app-registration-portal#create-the-registration).

## Create an agent in Copilot Studio

You'll create an agent in Copilot Studio by selecting the environment in which Omnichannel for Customer Service is configured. For detailed instructions, go to [Create an agent](/power-virtual-agents/authoring-first-bot).

For example, you can create an agent with the following details:

- **Name**: A descriptive name for the agent, such as **Greeter bot**.
- **Language**: The primary language for the agent, such as **English (US)**.
- **Environment**: The environment where Omnichannel for Customer Service is configured, such as **contoso-printers**.

## Create a topic in Bot Framework Composer

1. In Copilot Studio, for the agent that you created, select **Topics** in the site map, and then in the **Topics** pane, select the dropdown arrow for **New topic**. A message appears stating that the application is trying to open Bot Framework Composer. Learn more about how to navigate the Bot Framework Composer in: [Tutorial: Create a weather bot with composer](/composer/tutorial-create-weather-bot).

1. Select **Open**, and on the **Import your bot to new project** dialog that appears, enter the following details:

   - **Name**: A name for the project, such as **Multilingual bot**.
   - **Location**: Select a folder on the computer.

1. In Bot Framework Composer, select **More commands** (...), select **Add a dialog**, and enter the following details:

   - **Name**: A name such as **PVA greeter dialog**.
   - **Description**: A brief description. 

1. In the site map, select **BeginDialog**, select the **Add** (+) node, and then select **Send a response**.

   1. In the **Bot responses** section, select the **Add** (+) node, and then select **Speech**.

   1. Select **Add alternative**, and then add the following text.

      `<speak version="1.0" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xml:lang="en-US"><voice name="en-US-AriaNeural"><lang xml:lang="en-US">Hello ${virtualagent.msdyn_CustomerName}. Welcome to contoso customer support.</lang></voice></speak>`

      > [!NOTE]
      > The ${virtualagent.msdyn_CustomerName} variable provides the customer name for authenticated customers only through record identification. Learn more in [Identify customers automatically](record-identification-rule.md)

   1. Select the **Add** (+) node in **BeginDialog**, point to **Ask a question**, and then select **Multi-choice**.

      :::image type="content" source="../media/pva-ask-question.png" alt-text="Select the multiple-choice option for asking a question.":::

   1. Repeat steps a and b to add the following text.

      `<speak version="1.0" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xml:lang="en-US"><voice name="en-US-AriaNeural"><lang xml:lang="en-US">Press or say 1 for English.</lang><break strength="medium"/><lang xml:lang="fr-FR"> Appuyez ou dites 2 pour le français.</lang><break strength="medium"/><lang xml:lang="pt-PT">Pressione 3 para português.</lang></voice></speak>`

   1. Select the **User input** box, and enter the following details on the rightmost pane:

      - **Property**: conversation.language_choice
      - **Array of choices**: 1, 2, 3, one, two, three, un, deux, trois, um, dois, três
       
      In **Array of choices**, specify one choice per expression.

     :::image type="content" source="../media/pva-framework-setup.png" alt-text="Set calues for an Array of choices.":::
     
   1. Select the **Add** (+) node, select **Create a condition**, and then select **Branch Switch (multiple options)**. Enter the following details:

      - **Condition**: conversation.language_choice
      - **Value**: 1, 2, 3, One, Two, Three, Un, deux, trois, Um, dois, três   
       
        Enter one choice per value.
     
   1. Select the **Add** (+) node and then select **Manage properties** > **Set a property** and enter the following details:

      - **Condition**: virtualagent.va_CustomerLocale
      - **Value**: en-US   
      
     Repeat the steps to **Set a property** for fr-FR, pt-PT, hi-IN.

     :::image type="content" source="../media/va-customer-locale.png" alt-text="Set customer locale by using the branch switch option.":::

      The value for the virtualagent.va_CustomerLocale variable will be updated with the language selected by the customer.

      > [!NOTE]
      > You must set the va_CustomerLocale context variable with the locale codes for the languages that you want to support. Learn more in [Supported locations and locale codes](voice-channel-supported-languages.md#supported-languages-and-locale-codes)

   1. Select the **Add** (+) node, and then select **Begin a Power Virtual Agent topic**.

   1. Select t**Publish**, select the agent, and then select **Publish selected bots**.

   1. Select **Okay** .

1. In Copilot Studio, refresh **Topics**. You'll see the topic listed.

1. Select **Publish**.

## Finish set up in Copilot Studio

1. Configure the [greeting topic](/microsoft-copilot-studio/configure-bot-greeting#create-a-new-user-topic) and the [escalate topic](/microsoft-copilot-studio/advanced-hand-off).
1. [Configure handoff to Dynamics 365 Customer Service](/microsoft-copilot-studio/configuration-hand-off-omnichannel).

## Configure workstreams and queues

Use the information in the following articles to configure a voice workstream and a voice queue, and their routing rules.

- [Configure a workstream](create-workstreams.md)
- [Configure work classification](configure-work-classification.md)
- [Configure a queue](queues-omnichannel.md)
- [Configure assignment methods](configure-assignment-rules.md)

For example, ensure the following settings:

1. Configure three voice queues—one each for English, French, and Portuguese—and add the required agents.

1. Configure a voice workstream with English as the primary language, and French and Portuguese as additional languages.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/multilingual-workstream.png" alt-text="Workstream with multiple language options set.":::

1. In the route to queues rule set of the workstream, use **Conversation.CustomerLanguage** as the criteria to route the incoming call to different language queues based on the option that's selected by the customer.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/multilingual-route-to-queue-rules.png" alt-text="Route-to-queue rules for the multilingual contact center workstream":::

1. In the **Bot** area of the workstream, edit to add the Copilot Studio agent that you configured.

## Verify the multilingual agents

1. As a customer, call the number that's registered with the voice workstream.

1. When you're prompted with an interactive voice response (IVR) message, select a language. Verify that the agent routes the call to an agent who can speak with you in the language that you've selected.
