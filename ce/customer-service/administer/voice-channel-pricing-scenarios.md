# Pricing scenarios for voice calling

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes](../../includes/cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes.md)]

[!INCLUDE[pva-rebrand](../../includes/cc-pva-rebrand.md)]

The Dynamics 365 Customer Service voice channel is built on Azure Communication Services. Billing for Azure Communication Services uses a pay-as-you-go model and varies per [country](https://github.com/Azure/Communication/blob/master/pricing/communication-services-pstn-rates.csv). Calling and screen-sharing services are billed per minute per participant. More information: [Pricing Scenarios](/azure/communication-services/concepts/pricing).

 Azure Communication Services doesn't charge for data egress.

[Several call flows are possible](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=866544). This article describes pricing calculations for the following call scenarios:

- [Inbound: A customer calls from a mobile device; an IVR bot escalates the call to a customer service representative](#inbound-customer-calls-from-a-mobile-call-is-escalated-to-a-representative-from-an-ivr-agent)
- [Inbound: A customer calls from Microsoft Teams](#inbound-a-customer-calls-from-microsoft-teams)
- [Inbound: A customer calls from Teams; a supervisor joins the call to monitor the conversation](#inbound-a-customer-calls-from-teams-a-supervisor-joins-the-call-to-monitor-the-conversation)
- [Inbound: A customer calls from a mobile device; the supervisor is invited to consult](#inbound-a-customer-calls-from-a-mobile-device-the-supervisor-is-invited-to-consult)
- [Inbound: A customer calls from Teams; the call is transferred to a service representative through Teams PSTN](#inbound-a-customer-calls-from-teams-the-call-is-transferred-to-a-service-representative-through-teams-pstn)
- [Outbound: A service representative calls a customer](#outbound-a-service-representative-calls-a-customer)
- [Inbound: Azure direct routing](#inbound-azure-direct-routing)
- [Outbound: Azure direct routing](#outbound-azure-direct-routing)

The following table summarizes the pricing for each scenario. The prices in the following examples are for illustrative purposes and might not reflect the latest Azure pricing in your region.

|Scenario  | Price   |
|----------|-----------|
|PSTN inbound    | $0.022 per minute      |
|PSTN outbound    | $0.013 per minute      |
|VOIP inbound| $0.004 per minute   |
|SBC to Azure Communication Services | $0.004 per minute   |
|ROW Consumption Unit – Inbound -> PSTN inbound rate |  $0.022 per minute |
| App to App Group Calling User Minute –> VOIP rate | $0.004 per minute |
|ROW Consumption Unit – Outbound –> PSTN outbound rate | $0.013 per minute|
|Single Channel Mixed Audio Recording –> Recording rate| $0.004 per minute   |
 
## Inbound: Customer calls from a mobile, call is escalated to a representative from an IVR agent

Mae calls your Azure Communication Services US toll-free number from a mobile device. The call is routed to a Copilot Studio interactive voice response (IVR) bot. Mae interacts with the bot for two minutes. The bot escalates the call to a service representative, Matias. This call lasts eight minutes.

:::image type="content" source="../media/Customer-call-escalated-human-agent-IVR.png" alt-text="Inbound call from customer through Teams":::

Cost calculation:

- One participant on PSTN (inbound from Mae) x 10 minutes x 0.022 per participant per minute = $0.22.
- One participant on Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) (inbound to Copilot Studio bot) X 2 x $0.004 per minute = $0.008.
  > [!NOTE]
  > The VOIP call to the Copilot Studio bot isn't covered by the intelligent voice bot minutes included in the Voice Channel Add-in license.
- One participant on VOIP (inbound to Matias) x 8 x $0.004 per participant per minute= $0.032.

**Total cost for the call**: $0.22 + $0.008 + $0.032 = $0.26.

## Inbound: A customer calls from Microsoft Teams

Mae calls your Azure Communication Services US toll-free number from Microsoft Teams. The call is routed to Matias and lasts 20 minutes.

:::image type="content" source="../media/customer-calls-from-teams.png" alt-text="Diagram illustrating an inbound customer call from Microsoft Teams.":::

Cost calculation:

- One participant on Teams (inbound from Mae) x 20 minutes x rate per minute (Mae's call is covered by the Teams license)
- One participant on PSTN (inbound from Mae) x 20 minutes x $0.022 per minute = $0.44
- One participant on VOIP (inbound to Matias) x 20 minutes x $0.004 per minute = $0.08

**Total cost for the call**: $0.44 + $0.08 = $0.52 + applicable Teams charges

## Inbound: A customer calls from Teams; a supervisor joins the call to monitor the conversation

Mae calls your Azure Communication Services US toll-free number from Teams. The call is routed to Matias, who starts recording it. Gaby, Matias's supervisor, joins to monitor the conversation. The call lasts 10 minutes. The recording stops when the call ends.

:::image type="content" source="../media/Customer-calls-Teams-supervisor-joins.png" alt-text="Diagram illustrating an inbound customer call from Microsoft Teams with a supervisor monitoring.":::

Cost calculation:

- One participant on Teams (inbound from Mae) x 10 minutes x rate per minute (Mae's call is covered by the Teams license)
- One participant on PSTN (inbound from Mae) x 10 minutes x $0.022 per minute = $0.22
- One participant on VOIP (inbound to Matias) x 10 minutes x $0.004 per minute = $0.04
- One participant on VOIP (Gaby joins to monitor) x 10 minutes x $0.004 per minute = $0.04 (charged only when Gaby joins the call)
- Cost to record = 10 minutes x $0.002 per minute = $0.02
- Omnichannel for Customer Service recording bot doesn't introduce extra Azure Communication Services VOIP charges.
