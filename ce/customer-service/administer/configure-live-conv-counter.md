# Configure live conversation counter to view customer wait time

The service-level agreement (SLA) live conversation counter shows customer service representatives (service representatives or representatives) a visual indicator of the time elapsed during live chat conversations, where there hasn't been a response to the customer. It helps them monitor SLA compliance and ensure timely and efficient interactions.

> [!NOTE]
> The feature supports live chat workstreams only.

## Prerequisites

You must be a omnichannel administrator.

## Configure the live conversation counter

You can enable the conversation live counter, configure specific time for SLA violations, and define the thresholds for **Warning** and **Urgent** statuses.

1. In the site map of the Copilot Service admin center, go to **Workstreams** in **Customer Support**.
1. Select any live chat workstream, and then select **Show advanced settings**.
1. Select **Edit** or select **Turn on timer** in the **Live conversation counter for customer wait time** section.
1. Select the **Turn on live conversation counter for customer wait time** checkbox.
1. In the **Add condition for the level of urgency on counter** section, fill in the **Value** and **Unit** fields for the **Warning** and **Urgent** states, as required by your organization.
1. Save the settings.
