# Configure knowledge management

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]


## Introduction

A comprehensive knowledge base is a key to increased customer satisfaction and improved productivity of users. Give users quick access to the knowledge base by setting up knowledge management in Dynamics 365 Customer Service.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Usage of [!INCLUDE[pn_parature](../../includes/pn-parature.md)] knowledgebase as a knowledge management solution has been deprecated. Learn more in [Important changes coming](/dynamics365/get-started/whats-new/customer-engagement/important-changes-coming).
  
After knowledge management is set up, users are able to:  
  
- Search for relevant knowledge base articles from Customer Service while they're working on a record.  
  
- Set up the search logic, suggest-as-you-type option, and search filters to get only the required knowledge articles. These features help users provide timely and consistent information to customers while working on their cases.

- Use smart assist to receive AI suggestions on related knowledge articles and similar cases.

- See the content of the knowledge base article inline, including images and videos.

## Setup overview

You can set up knowledge management on the Customer Service admin center, Contact Center admin center, or manually for a model-driven app.

- [Set up knowledge management](#set-up-knowledge-management)
- [Set up knowledge management settings page manually for a model-driven app](#set-up-knowledge-management-settings-page-manually-for-a-model-driven-app)

## Set up knowledge management settings page manually for a model-driven app

> [!NOTE]
> The embedded knowledge search control is deprecated in the web client. You must use the Knowledge Settings page in Unified Interface.

 If you're using the custom model-driven app, you need to manually update your site map with the Knowledge Settings page. To update the site map:

    * URL: Enter  ```/main.aspx?pagetype=inlinedialog&name=KnowledgeSettings```

    The **Knowledge Settings** page appears.

## Configure knowledge base article URLs

Knowledge articles can be configured with their portal URLs, and then service representatives can copy and share the URL links.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can configure knowledge articles with their own URLs, you must create a portal using your domain name. Learn more about creating a portal at [Create a portal in an environment containing customer engagement apps](/powerapps/maker/portals/create-dynamics-portal).

You can configure a knowledge base article URL in the Customer Service admin center or Contact Center admin center app.

1. In the site map of Customer Service admin center or Contact Center admin center, select **Knowledge** in **Agent experience**. The **Knowledge** page appears.
1. On the **Knowledge** page, go to the **Portal** section and select **Manage**. The **Portal** page appears.
1. On the **Portal** page, go to the **Support portal connection** section.

1. Set the **Use an external portal** toggle to **Yes**.

1. In the **URL format** field, enter the URL name.

1. Select **Save**.

The knowledge base article link is now active and can be copied and shared.

## Update knowledge article attachments for portal

With the knowledge article attachments option, you can stop using notes attachments for the portal. To use knowledge article attachments for the portal, you must enable the feature in the Customer Service admin center or Contact Center admin center app.

1. In the site map of Customer Service admin center or Contact Center admin center, select **Knowledge** in **Agent experience**. The **Knowledge** page appears.
1. In the **Portals** section, select **Manage**. The **Portal** page appears.
1. On the **Portals** page, go to the **Sync knowledge article attachments to portal** section.

## Set up AI suggestions for article keywords and description

You can enable knowledge authors to get suggested keywords and description based on the article content stored in the built-in knowledge article entity. Learn more in [Configure AI suggestions for article keywords and description](configure-ai-suggested-article-keywords-description.md#configure-ai-suggestions-for-article-keywords-and-description).

## Set up knowledge search logic

If you have Dataverse search enabled, you can apply knowledge search logic for your knowledge articles to help service representatives find only the articles they need. By default, knowledge search works by the `searchMode=any` logic, which brings up articles that match any of the keywords used in your search. If you search for Contoso Coffee, the search results show articles that have either "Contoso" or "Coffee", as seen in the following example:

- Article 1: Contoso machine repair
- Article 2: Coffee powder quality
- Article 3: Contoso coffee order price
- Article 4: Coffee machine order for Contoso
- Article 5: Espresso coffee machine troubleshooting

You can enable the knowledge search to work by the `searchmode=all` logic, which matches all the keywords that you used in the search. If you search for Contoso Coffee, the search results show articles that match both "Contoso" and "Coffee", as seen in the following example:

- Article 1: Contoso coffee order price
- Article 2: Coffee machine order for Contoso

You can set up the knowledge search logic in the Customer Service admin center or Contact Center admin center app.

1. In the site map of Customer Service admin center or Contact Center admin center, select **Knowledge** in **Agent experience**.
1. On the **Knowledge** page, in the **General settings** section, select **Manage**. The **General settings** page appears.

1. In the **Knowledge search experience** section, set the **Set search mode as all** toggle to **Yes**.

1. Select **Save**.

Learn more in [Search across table data using Dataverse search](/power-platform/admin/configure-relevance-search-organization).

## Enable the suggest-as-you-type option

You can help service representatives improve their productivity by setting the **Enable suggest as you type** toggle to **Yes**. This feature provides suggestions on the most relevant records as service representatives type keywords in the search box. The search phrase is matched against the title of the article, and the matching results appear in a flyout menu. The matched text is highlighted to show the presence of the keyword.

When a customer service representative selects the record, the system displays the article inline on the knowledge search control embedded on a form, on an application tab in Customer Service workspace, and as an inline view in the independent knowledge search control. Learn more in [Use suggest-as-you-type](../use/search-knowledge-articles-csh.md#save-time-searching-with-suggest-as-you-type).

1. In the site map of Customer Service admin center or Contact Center admin center, select **Knowledge** in **Agent experience**.
2. On the **Knowledge** page, in the **General settings** section, select **Manage**. The **General settings** page appears.
3. In the **Knowledge search experience** section, set the **Enable suggest as you type** toggle to **Yes**.
4. Select **Save**.

## Show recently accessed knowledge articles for cases

Knowledge search shows the recently accessed results for keyword searches made by service representatives across different cases without initiating any search. This feature helps service representatives directly review and use the articles across similar cases without searching for the keyword again.

1. In the site map of Customer Service admin center or Contact Center admin center, select **Knowledge** in **Agent experience**.
2. On the **Knowledge** page, in the **General settings** section, select **Manage**. The **General settings** page appears.
3. In the **Knowledge search experience** section, set the **Show recently viewed knowledge articles** toggle to **Yes**.
1. Select the number of articles you want displayed from the **Number of recently viewed articles shown** drop-down list. You can show a min of one to a max of eight articles.
1. Select **Save**.
