# Turn on linking of timeline notes with other table records

You can use **Relate note to a table record** to perform the following actions without leaving the page that you're on:

- Move a note on the timeline of an existing table record to another table record. For example, you can move a note on the timeline of a contact to an existing case. After you move the note, it'll appear only on the timeline to which you've moved and not on both. 
- Create a new table record from the note. For example, you can create a case from an existing note on a contact's timeline.

You can enable this feature for any table that allows you to add a timeline component. However, the tables that a note can be linked to are only account, contact, and case.

## Configure linking of timeline notes

1. In [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/), select the environment that contains your solution.
1. Select **Tables**, and then select the table for which agents can link notes taken on the timeline.
1. Select **Form**.
1. Create a new form or use an existing form. More information: [Create, edit, or configure forms using the model-driven form designer](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/create-and-edit-forms).
1. Select the timeline component on the form.
1. In the **Properties** > **Notes** section, perform the following steps:
    - Select **Link to Table**.
    - Select the table you want to link the note to. You can select account, case, and contact. The required table's pane appears.
    - Select **Enable** on the tableâ€™s pane. If you've selected **Case**, you must specify the following:
      - **Create Case using**: the form type that opens when the agent creates a new case from the note.
      - **Configure form**: the form that is displayed when the agent creates a new case from the note.
      - **Map notes title to**: the field to which the notes title should get copied. For example, if you select **Case Title**, when you create a new case, the Case title is auto- populated with the value of the notes title.
      - **Map notes description to**: The field to which the notes description should get copied to. For example, if you select **Description**, when you create a new case, the case description is auto populated with the value of the notes description. 
1. Save and publish the customizations.
