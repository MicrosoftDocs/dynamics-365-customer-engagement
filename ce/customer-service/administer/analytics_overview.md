# Use and customize analytics and insights

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]


As an administrator, you can [enable analytics and insights](configure-customer-service-analytics-insights-csh.md#configure-analytics-and-insights-dashboards) features within Customer Service. This data can then be shared with supervisors so they can review and analyze contact center activities. This valuable information can help identify and address issues, improve customer service representative (service representative or representative) efficiency, and ultimately enhance productivity and customer satisfaction.

You can configure these features and services in the Customer Service admin center or Contact Center admin center app. Once set up, supervisors can use the Customer Service workspace app to access and view them.

## Use out-of-the-box features

Customer Service provides various default dashboards and reports. These dashboards display a range of charts, metrics, and key performance indicators that can offer valuable insights about your contact center operations. Here's an overview of what's readily available to you.

### Access dashboards

Supervisors can access and view these dashboards from the Customer Service workspace app.

**Historical**

- [Customer Service historical analytics dashboards](../use/customer-service-analytics-insights-csh.md#customer-service-historical-analytics-reports): Use the performance summary and detailed reports on cases, service representatives, and topics to improve customer service.

- [Omnichannel historical analytics dashboards](../use/omnichannel-analytics-insights.md): Use key performance indicators coupled with AI-generated insights to get a view into the support operations across various channels.

- [Knowledge analytics reports](../use/knowledge-search-analytics-cs.md): Use article and search term insights to understand how service representatives use knowledge articles to resolve customer issues.

**Real time**

- [Omnichannel real-time analytics dashboards](../use/intro-realtime-analytics-dashboard.md#overview-of-omnichannel-real-time-analytics-dashboard): Monitor key operational metrics in real-time and make course corrections at the appropriate time to help keep service levels high.

## Customize features

Here are the customizations that you can utilize.

- [Customize Key Performance Indicators](../use/customize-reports.md#customize-visual-display): Use the embedded Power BI editor to modify the visual display of dashboards, tailoring the out-of-the-box reports to your organization's needs.
- Personalize analytics:
  - [Report Filters and Groups](../use/report-filters-groups.md#report-filters-and-groups): Save time by setting one or more filters to a report group, eliminating the need to set filters each time you access the reports.
  - [Manage Bookmarks for Reports](../use/manage-bookmarks.md#manage-bookmarks-for-reports): Utilize bookmarks to save the filters you set, allowing for easy viewing of specific data each time you open the report.
- [Utilize Omnichannel for Customer Service Metrics](../use/oc-metrics-dimensions.md#use-omnichannel-for-customer-service-metrics): Perform a quantitative assessment of the data displayed on the Omnichannel for Customer Service dashboards. Use these metrics to [customize the visual display](../use/customize-reports.md#customize-visual-display) of your reports.
