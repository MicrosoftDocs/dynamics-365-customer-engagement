# Sample - ARC Multi-Related - Remove Unreferenced Queue

The sample shows how automatic record creation rules for Dynamics 365 Customer Service can be customized to remove unreferenced queues from emails. This customization is applicable when you enable the [create multiple cases from an email sent to multiple mailboxes](arc-multiple-cases.md#create-multiple-cases-from-an-email-sent-to-multiple-mailboxes) feature.

Detailed instructions on how to run the sample and its functionality can be found in the [README.md file](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365-Apps-Samples/blob/master/customer-service/automatic-record-creation/RemoveUnreferencedQueues/README.md).
