# Enable transfer of conversations to representatives

You can enable the transfer of conversations to customer service representatives (service representatives or representatives) in your contact center. This allows service representatives to transfer conversations to other representatives, making sure that customers receive the assistance they need.

## Prerequisite

System administrator or Omnichannel administrator role.

## Enable transfer of conversations

1. In Copilot Service admin center, go to **Channels** in **Customer support**.
1. Select **Manage** for **Consult and transfer**.
1. On the **Consult and transfer** page, enable the **transfer to representatives** toggle.
1. Select **Save**.

## Runtime experience

Only after you enable the transfer to representatives setting, your service representatives can see the **Representatives** tab on the communication panel. The tab also appears when the representative wants to transfer conversations to another representative after engaging in a consultation with them.
