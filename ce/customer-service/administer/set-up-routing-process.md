# How to set up unified routing

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes](../../includes/cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes.md)]


In this article, we'll take you through the high-level process of configuring unified routing in Customer Service.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the UI because you'll perform the steps and procedures on different pages.

- The System Administrator role to set up unified routing for records and work items.
- To route records, you must enable the record for routing using the records channel configuration. More information: [Records routing](enable-entities-for-queues.md)


## Set up unified routing for records

The sequence of the tasks that you'll need to perform for setting up unified routing are outlined in the following table.

|Step|Task |Description|
|----------|-----------|-------|
|![Step 1.](../media/step-1.png "Step 1") |[Provision unified routing for Customer Service](provision-unified-routing.md)| Turn on unified routing in Service Configuration Settings.|
|![Step 2.](../media/step-2.png "Step 2") |<ol><li>[Create users in Microsoft 365 admin center](/power-platform/admin/create-users)</li><li>[Set up the user as a bookable resource](users-user-profiles.md)</li></ol>| Create users in Microsoft 365 and configure them in Customer Service.|
|![Step 3.](../media/step-3.png "Step 3") |[Create and manage queues for unified routing](queues-omnichannel.md)| Set up queues in advanced queues section and add users. |
|![Step 4.](../media/step-4.png "Step 4") |[Set up unified routing for records](set-up-record-routing.md#configure-unified-routing-for-records)|Configure a record for routing.|
|![Step 5.](../media/step-5.png "Step 5") |[Create workstreams for record routing](set-up-record-routing.md#create-workstreams-for-record-routing)|Configure a workstream for record routing|
|![Step 6.](../media/step-6.png "Step 6") |[Enable routing diagnostics](unified-routing-diagnostics.md#manage-routing-diagnostics)|Turn on routing diagnostics|

### Try the runtime experience in Customer Service workspace

Make sure that you have the Customer Service Representative role to try the runtime experience and do the following:

1. Perform the steps in [Create a case](../use/customer-service-hub-user-guide-create-a-case.md).
2. Go to the case details page, and select **Save & Route** on the window.

## Set up unified routing for channels

The high-level process to set up unified routing for a channel is as follows.

|Step|Task |Description|

|![Step 2.](../media/step-2.png "Step 2")|[Create a workstream for unified routing](create-workstreams.md)| Create a workstream for routing conversations|
|![Step 3 for configuring queues.](../media/step-3.png "Step 3")|[Create and manage queues](queues-omnichannel.md)|Configure queues for conversations|
|![Step 4 for configuring routing rules.](../media/step-4.png "Step 4") |[Configure routing rules](configure-work-classification.md)| Configure routing rules for conversations|
