# Set up auto-summarization for conversations

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes](../../includes/cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes.md)]


Agents can collaborate with other agents and contacts directly while they're working in Dynamics 365 Customer Service. To help agents easily recap an ongoing customer interaction, turn on auto-summarization for conversations. Agents can generate a conversation summary when they either transfer a conversation, add a user to consult, or start a linked Teams chat. The summary quickly provides context and relays any steps taken.

## Components of an auto-summarize conversations

The conversation summary feature uses an AI natural language model to summarize a transcript of an active conversation. Summaries are limited to the first 7,000 characters of a transcript.

A summary includes the following components:

- **Issue description**: Summarizes the key customer problems to solve in a conversation. The model needs at least three customer messages to generate the issue description.

- **Resolution tried**: Summarizes any troubleshooting steps or possible solutions that agents have tried. If the model can't identify a resolution from the transcript, this section is blank. If the case is resolved or the conversation ends, the application displays this label as **Resolution**.

## Regional availability and supported languages

The auto-summarization of conversations is available in United States and Europe.

This feature is supported only in English.


## Prerequisites
