# Manage historical analytics reports in Customer Service

You can configure Customer Service historical analytics to give your service managers a combination of BI analytics and AI insights for their organization. The reports use natural language understanding to automatically detect the language used in your support cases and group related support cases into topics.

By default, the Customer Service historical analytics reports are enabled for the System Administrator and CSR Manager roles. To configure other user roles to access analytics and dashboards, see [Configure user access to analytics and dashboards](configure-customer-service-analytics-insights-csh.md#configure-user-access-to-analytics-and-dashboards).

The historical reports include:

- [Summary report](../use/summary-dashboard-cs.md)
- [Agent report](../use/agent-dashboard-cs.md)
- [Topics report](../use/case-topics-dashboard-cs.md)
- [Unified routing](../use/cs-historical-analytics-unified-routing.md)

After you enable the reports, you can access them in one of the following ways:

- In Customer Service workspace, select the hamburger menu, and then select **Customer Service historical analytics** in the site map.

- In Customer Service Hub, in **Service**, in the site map, select **Customer Service historical analytics**.
