# Migrate SLAs

Service-level agreements (SLAs) are deprecated in the web client. We recommend migrating standard and enhanced SLAs created in web client to Unified Interface. For more information on the deprecation, see [SLAs in web client are deprecated](../implement/deprecations-customer-service.md#slas-in-web-client-are-deprecated). The migration tool for automatic record creation rules and service-level agreements (SLAs) helps migrate the rules in the web client to Unified Interface.

Before you begin the migration, learn how migrating to Unified Interface helps:

|Standard or Enhanced SLA  | Unified Interface |
|---------|---------|
|Condition Control in SLA item isn't accessible compliant    | Condition Control in SLA item is accessible compliant   |
|Uses Workflows for Actions    | Uses **Workflows** and **Power Automate** flows for Actions    |
|**Pause configurations** can be set only at **Table Level**    |  **Pause configurations** can be set at **Table**, **KPI**, and **SLA Item Level** |
|Calendar is on SLA level    | Calendar is on SLA item level       |
|Can't configure parallel KPIs    |  Can configure parallel KPIs   |
|Can't configure SLA items with different **Applicable From**     | Can configure SLA items with different **Applicable From**   |
|Limited number of actions     | Multiple actions (as Power Automate allows)      |
|No support for Custom Time Calculation and Recalculation   | Support for Custom Time Calculation and Recalculation of Warning Time and Failure Time of SLA     |
