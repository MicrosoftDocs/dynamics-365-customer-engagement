# Set up intelligent skill finder model

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes](../../includes/cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes.md)]

To configure machine learning-based skill classification rulesets, you can configure intelligent skill finder models that can be used for predicting skills.

You can create, test, and train machine-learning models that use AI to determine the necessary skills for new work items and by using the data in Microsoft Dataverse. However, if you're trying to set up the model in a new organization or if skill-based routing wasn't in use, you might not have the needed skill data. In such conditions, you can use data from another application by using the **Import from Excel** option in the skill finder model.

Intelligent skill finder depends upon the custom AI Builder category classification model. Therefore, AI Builder should be available in the geographical region where you want to use intelligent skill finder. More information: [Availability of AI Builder](/ai-builder/availability-region).

 > [!IMPORTANT]
 > If you want to import skill finder models from one environment to another, make sure that you import and export between environments of the same type. A model trained in test environment will work in another test environment only and not in a production environment.

  ## Prerequisite

You must enable [AI Builder preview models](/ai-builder/administer#enable-or-disable-ai-builder-preview-features) to use the intelligent skill finder model.

## Create skill finder models

You can create as many intelligent skill finder rating models as your business requires.

1. In the Customer Service admin center site map, select **Insights** in **Operations**. The **Insights** page appears.

1. In the **Intelligent skill finder** section, select **Manage**.

1. On the **Intelligent skill finder models** page, select **New**, and on the **Configuration** tab of **New skill finder model** page, enter a name.

1. In **Data criteria**, enter the following to form the dataset records:
    - **Attributes (Required)**: Select attributes in the Attributes and related list to form the training dataset. The corresponding attribute values will be merged in the sequence they are added and will be used to form the input string for the model training data.
    - **Filters**: Optionally, apply filters to conditionally select the relevant records.
    - **Date range**: Select a value to set the time period for which the records need to be loaded.

1. Select **Save**, and then select **Load training data**. The **Training data** tab appears and displays the data load status.

1. After the load is complete, review the data, and edit the records if you want to modify the tags.

1. In the **Training data** section, select the checkbox for **Input data** to select all the records, and select **Approve**. You must approve a minimum of 50 records for the model to be trained.

1. Select **Train model**, and select **Train model** again on the confirmation dialog.

1. After the status changes to training completed, select the rows that you want to publish, and select **Publish model**. The skills model is ready for use.

### Test the model

You can test your model to determine if it's working as expected. Perform the following steps to view the performance and accuracy of the model.

1. In [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/), select the environment that contains your solution.
1. Select **AI models**. You can view the models you've created in **My models** and the models that are shared to you in **Shared with me**. Select the required model.
1. Select **Quick test**. To get model related information, select vertical ellipsis beside **Quick Test** button, and then select **Download detailed metrics**. The metrics file contains information about model's performance, accuracy, and precision. For more information, see [Understand category classification model performance](/ai-builder/text-classification-performance)
1. In **Text**, enter the required text, and then select **Test**. The predicted tags appear in **Suggested tags and confidence**.
1. When the model runs, if the predicted tags match with available skills in the organization, the corresponding skills are linked to the model.

### Retrain the model iteratively

You should retrain your published model iteratively to improve the model with new data in Microsoft Dataverse. For example, model retraining can be done by using the records in which agents have updated the skills for records or conversations. When you retrain the model to include the skills added by agents, review the training data records after loading it to make sure it meets the required skill criteria.

For information about how your agents can update skills, see [Manage skills](../use/manage-skills.md). To enable your agents to update skills at runtime, see [Enable agents to update skills](allow-agents-update-skills.md).

You can define the conditions as seen in the following screenshot.

  ![Conditions to fetch data for retraining the model.](../media/retrain-conditions.png "Conditions to fetch data for retraining the model")

### Use training data from the Excel file

If you don't have data to train your model, you can populate skills and attributes data in Excel files and upload them to the application by using the import feature of Microsoft Dataverse.

To use the data from the Excel files, you must make sure of the following:

- The model name in the application should match the name in the Training record column of the Excel file.

- Name the files as msdyn_ocsitrainingdata.csv and msdyn_ocsitdskill.csv.

- Ensure that the input data string is less than or equal to 5000 characters to avoid truncation.
  
A sample of each file is as follows. You can select the links to download the sample files.
