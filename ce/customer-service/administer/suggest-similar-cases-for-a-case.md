# Use advanced similarity rules to view similar case suggestions

Quickly support your customers by viewing similar cases suggestions in the Customer Service Hub. As an administrator, you can now configure criteria using advanced similarity rules, so that customer service representatives (service representatives or representatives) can view cases similar to their current case and resolve customer issues in first contact and within minimal time frame. This helps to reduce operational cost and in turn increase customer satisfaction.

If a representative is working on a support case, they can view similar cases in the **Related** section of the current case, and resolve their case quickly. With the help of Relevance search, they can use keywords or key phrases in a service case to quickly find related cases and use them to resolve customer issues.
  
## Similar case suggestion scenario

Gilda is resolving an issue where a customer isn't able to book a travel package on the portal. To assist the customer quickly, Gilda seeks guidance by looking for similar cases in the **Similar cases** tab in the **Related** section of the current case.

Based on configured data input, the Relevance search mechanism filters the cases using key phrases and suggests a list of cases. Gilda selects a relevant case and glances through the details. Gilda is able to resolve the customer issue with this suggested case and can also link the case to the current case for future reference. 

## Create a new similarity rule to view similar cases

 Set up automatic suggestion of similar cases by creating advanced similarity rules. The rules you create use the Relevance search mechanism.

[!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Use Relevance Search for faster, comprehensive search results](/powerapps/user/relevance-search)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is recommended to enable Relevance search for your org to see the most accurate suggestions for similar cases. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Understand how relevance search impacts search results](#understand-how-relevance-search-impacts-search-results)

1. Make sure you have the Customer Service Manager, System Administrator, or System Customizer security role or equivalent permissions.  
  
    #### Check your security role
  
    - [!INCLUDE[proc_follow_steps_in_link](../../includes/proc-follow-steps-in-link.md)]  
  
    - [!INCLUDE[proc_dont_have_correct_permissions](../../includes/proc-dont-have-correct-permissions.md)]  
  
1. In the site map of Customer Service admin center, go to **Case Settings** in **Customer Support**. The **Case Settings** page appears.
1. In the **Advanced similarity rules** section, select **Manage**. The **All Advanced Similarity Rules** page appears.

1. Select **New** on the command bar to create an advanced similarity rule.  

1. Enter the following on the **Details** tab:

   - **Name** (required): The rule name.
   - **Source Entity** (required): Select Case entity for similar cases suggestions.
   - **Description**: A description of the similarity rule.
   - **Noise Key phrases**: Provide noise key phrases separated by a semicolon (**;**). These phrases are filtered out in the search for a similar case.
   - **Filter Result by Status**: Filter records by status. If you set the value to **Active**, then only similar cases with active status are retrieved. If you donâ€™t set a value, then it retrieves similar cases that are in all statuses.

1. Select **Save** to save the rule.

1. On the **Match Fields** tab, select **New Text Analytics Entity Mapping** to add a related text analytics entity mapping record to the rule.

1. On the **Details** tab, enter the following values. These values are used to determine the keywords or key phrases from source records using relevance search to match with target records using text search. This helps to achieve keyword-based similarity between source and target records.

   - **Criteria**: Select **Text match** if you want text in these fields to be used for finding key phrases to match. For example, if you select **Case Title** or **Description**, text in these fields will be matched. Select **Exact match** if you want all fields except single-line and multi-line text fields to be enabled for exact match. More information: Enable a field for exact matching of similar records
   - **Entity** (required): Choose an entity from the drop-down list to be used to create a text search rule to find matching records in Dynamics 365 apps.
   - **Field** (required): Choose the field to be used to create a text search rule to find matching target records.

     Two types of fields are used for similarity analysis:

      -  **Structured**: Used for exact match on a field to field basis. All fields except Multiple Lines of Text are available for exact match. Each field can be used only once.
      -  **Text**: Fields of type Text or Option Set only are available. For Option Set, the corresponding label in the language of the user is used. Text fields are used for fuzzy match in similarity analysis with keywords/key phrase extraction. Each field can be used only once.

1. Select **Save** to save the rule.

1. Select **Activate** from the command bar to activate the rule.

Similarly, add more mappings to view a comprehensive search of related records.
  
### Understand how relevance search impacts search results

See the below table to understand how search results are impacted when Relevance search is enabled or disabled.


|Relevance search disabled  |Relevance search enabled  |
|---------|---------|
|Based on the similarity rules, search is performed across primary field of an entity.  |   Based on the attributes configured in similarity rules,  search is performed on entity attributes configured for relevance search.   |
|For example,  if similarity rules are configured on Title and Category, comma-separated attribute text is passed to look for a match in the Case title of case entity.     |  For example,    if similarity rules are configured on Title and Category, and Relevance search is enabled on Description, the search is performed for Title and Category in the Description field of case entity.     |
|  |         |
