You can import phone numbers that you purchased or acquired earlier via Azure Communication Services resources into Dynamics 365. 

1. In the site map of Customer Service admin center or Contact Center admin center, select **Channels** in **Customer support**. The **Channels** page appears.    
    2. Select **Manage** for **Phone numbers**.
2. Select **Advanced** on the menu.
3. Select **Sync** for **Sync from Azure**. A dialog requesting you to confirm the sync action is displayed.
4. Select **Sync**.

   After you perform the sync, all the phone numbers that were acquired previously are listed on the **Phone numbers** page with the numbers that have been acquired in Omnichannel for Customer Service.
