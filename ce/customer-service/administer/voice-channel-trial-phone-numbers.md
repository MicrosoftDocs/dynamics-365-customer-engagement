# Use trial phone numbers

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes](../../includes/cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes.md)]

The voice channel provides up to two trial phone numbers with limited free calling time for your organization. When you run the voice trial for the first time, you're automatically assigned a toll-free trial phone number.Â The total free calling time for the two trial phone numbers is 60 minutes.

For information about setting up the trial and licensing requirements, see [Customer Service trial FAQ](../implement/trial-faq.md) and [Licensing](../implement/system-requirements-omnichannel.md#licensing).


## How trial phone numbers work

The trial phone number is a toll-free US number, so you'll be able to call this number from within US only. To be able to receive international calls, we recommend that you use a geographic US number as your second trial number. If you're calling the geographic number from outside the US, then international carrier rates will apply.

Your voice trial automatically ends after the free calling time elapses. You can also manually end the trial before the free calling time elapses. More information: [End the trial](#end-the-trial)

You can't reuse or purchase the trial phone number. After your free calling time has elapsed, you can either [purchase new phone numbers](voice-channel-manage-phone-numbers.md) or request Microsoft Support for more calling minutes. 

> [!NOTE]
> You don't need to connect to Azure Communication Services to use trial numbers.
## End the trial

If you want to end the trial before it expires, select **End trial** on the **Phone numbers** page. Then, you'll be able to connect to Azure Communication Services using new or existing resources. More information: [Connect to Azure Communication Services](voice-channel-acs-resource.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can't recover trial phone number and any related data after the trial organization has expired and been deprovisioned.
