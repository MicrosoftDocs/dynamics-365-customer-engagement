# Understand scheduling entities

Scheduling entities are grouped under the following logical groups.

**Scheduling**

- **Resources** </br>
   Anything that needs to be scheduled can be termed as **Resources**. These resources can be personnel, crews, service centers, company assets (equipment), accounts, or contacts.

     Learn more at [Create and set up bookable resources](resources-service-scheduling.md).

- **Facilities/Equipment**  </br>
   Facilities and equipment are resources you would use to perform services for your customers. Facilities can be physical spaces like service bays or conference rooms and equipment could be tools or other assets.

   Learn more at [Add facilities and equipment to schedule service](add-facilities-equipment-ss-csh.md).

- **Resource Categories** </br>
   With resource categories,  you can group your bookable resources by type. For example, you can create categories like technician, supervisor, subcontractor, vehicle, or equipment.

   Learn more at [Create and manage resource categories](resource-categories-service-scheduling.md).

- **Services**  </br>
   To make scheduling services quick and easy, it's helpful to predefine the specifics of the services you would provide to customers.

  Learn more at [Create or edit a service](create-edit-service-csh.md).

- **Service Activities** </br>
   Create a service activity by finding the next time resources are available for a service.

   Learn more at [Schedule a service activity](../use/schedule-service-activity-csh.md).

- **Fulfillment Preferences** </br>
    Choose and customize how to display schedule assistant results, like with neat hourly appointments or morning and afternoon time windows.

    Learn more at [Fulfillment preferences](../../common-scheduler/fulfillment-preferences.md).

**Tools**

- **Schedule Board** </br>
   The Dynamics 365 Customer Service schedule board provides an overview of resource availability and bookings you can make.

   Learn more at [Use the schedule board to configure service activity](../use/use-schedule-board-configure-service-activity.md).

**Settings**

- **Organizational Units** </br>
   Your company organizes its business by geography, function, or other areas. You can create organizational units that reflect your business.

   Learn more at [Create and manage organizational units](create-org-units-cs-scheduling.md).

- **Business Closure** </br>
   Prevent scheduling resources on holidays and other non-working days by defining business closures. 

   Learn more at [Set when your business is closed](../use/set-when-business-closed-csh.md).
