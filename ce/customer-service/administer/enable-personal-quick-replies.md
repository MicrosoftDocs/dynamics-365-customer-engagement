# Enable personal quick replies for agents

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]

You can allow agents to create their own personal quick replies that are stored in the agent's context and which the agent can invoke by using the associated tags during a session with a customer. Agents can use personal quick replies to respond to customer queries efficiently with minimal turnaround time.

As an administrator, you can use a Power Automate utility to delete unused tags.

## Enable personal quick replies

1. In the site map of Customer Service admin center or Contact Center admin center, in **Agent experience**, select **Productivity**.
   
1. For **Personal quick replies**, select **Manage**.

1. On the **Personal quick replies** tab, set the **Allow agents to create personal quick replies** toggle to **Yes**.

The settings for creating personal quick replies is made available for agents.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - It can take up to 15 minutes for the setting to take effect.
> - We recommend that you do not assign the System administrator role to agents or supervisors to avoid enabling access to other users personal quick replies on the **Quick replies** panel of a conversation.
