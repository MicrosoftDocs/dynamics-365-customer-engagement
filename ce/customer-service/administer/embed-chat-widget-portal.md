- **Maximized mode**: A user can maximize the chat widget to start a conversation with an agent.

- **System events**: System-generated messages appear for events, such as when an agent joins a conversation, or a conversation is transferred by the agent or supervisor to another agent.

- **Keyboard shortcut**: During the chat session, the customer can press **Ctrl+/** to return the cursor to the message send box from elsewhere on the page.

- **Pre-conversation survey**: If a survey is configured by an admin, it appears for the user before the conversation starts. This survey also helps the user connect to an appropriate agent.
