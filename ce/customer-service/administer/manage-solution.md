# Manage solutions with SLAs

After you create solutions, you can add SLAs and import, export, or upgrade a solution to suit your organizational requirements.

## Prerequisites

You must have SLAs with associated SLA KPI Instances and SLA Items.

## Manage solutions with SLAs in Unified Interface

This section provides steps on how to create, export, import, and upgrade a solution in Unified Interface.

### Create

1. Go to your Dynamics 365 organization.
1. Go to **Advanced Settings** > **Settings** > **Customization** > **Solutions**.
1. Select **New**. This takes you to the Power Apps portal.
1. In the **General** tab, fill the required mandatory fields.
    - **Display Name**: The name shown in the list of solutions. You can change this later.
    - **Name**: The unique name of the solution. This name is generated using the value you enter in the **Display Name** field. You can edit this name before you save the solution, but after you save the solution, you can’t change it.
    - **Publisher**: You can select the default publisher or create a new publisher. Unless you plan to distribute your solution, you should use the default publisher for your organization.
    - **Version**: Enter a number for the version of your solution. This number is only important if you export your solution. The version number is included in the file name when you export the solution.
1. Select **Save**. The **Components** page appears.
1. From the **Add Existing** dropdown list, select **SLA**.
1. Select the SLA records that you want to add from the **Select solution components** dialog.
1. On the **Add Required Components** dialog, select **OK**.
1. Select **Save**, and then select **Publish All Customizations**.
1. On the **Publish Customization** dialog box, select **Publish All customizations**, and then select **Next**.

### Export

After you publish the customizations that you made while [creating the solution](#create), you can export the solution.

1. On the **Export System Settings (Advanced)** dialog, select the required features to add, and then select **Next**.
1. On the **Package Type**, select the **Unmanaged** package type, and then select **Export**.

The **Exported Solution** zip file is downloaded.

### Import

After you export the solution from the source organization, you need to import the solution to the target organization.

1. In Dynamics 365, go to **Advanced Settings** > **Settings** > **Solutions**.
2. Select **Import**, and then select your solution zip file on the **Select solution package** dialog.
3. Select **Next** > **Import**. The solution import begins.
4. On the **Importing Solution** dialog, select **Publish All Customizations**.
5. After the import is complete, select **Download Log File** and then select **Publish All Customizations**. The SLAs are added to the target organization.

Proceed with the upgrade as necessary.

### Upgrade

You can add more components to the preinstalled base solution in the target org and upgrade it.
- The package type must be Unmanaged for an upgrade. 
- You need to add another SLA record to the base solution in the source org and then export and upgrade the solution in the target org.

1. In Power Apps, select **Select solution components**, and then select the SLA record.
2. From **Settings** > **Solutions**, select the solution created earlier or any existing solution, and then select **Clone solution**.
3. On the **Clone To Solution** dialog, add the version number.
4. Save and [export](#export) the higher version of the base solution.
5. Select **Import**, and then select **Publish All Customizations**.

The base solution from the target org version increases, and new components and SLA records are added to the target org.
