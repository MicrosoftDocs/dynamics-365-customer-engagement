# Create productivity automation macros

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]

 You can automate the following tasks with productivity automation macros: 

- open and update records
- open views
- resolve cases
- search knowledge base
- clone records
- set focus to another agent script
- open email templates
- auto fill form fields
- set and retrieve variables and values in the session context

 You can use the productivity automation actions any number of times across different macros to automate and perform model-driven app operations.

The following sections describe the different productivity automation actions that you can use to create macros.

## Open a new form to create a record

Opens a new form to create a record. The action contains the following fields.

   | Field | Description |
   |-----------------|-----------------------------|
   | Entity logical name |  Specify the logical name of the entity that you want to open. |  
   | Entity form ID | Specify the form ID.|
   | Attribute Name | Specify the attribute logical name. You need to provide the attribute name for the application to populate the field with a value.| 
   | Attribute Value | Specify the attribute value. You need to provide the attribute value for the application to populate the attribute field. |

> [!NOTE]
> This action requires a specific pattern to set lookup values. You must pass the related record id, record type, and record name as separate attributes for a single lookup.

### Example 1: Create a new task from an existing case
  
Perform the following steps to create a macro to open a task from the case:

 1. Add the **Open a new form to create a record** action that creates a task with the following attributes:
    - Subject: Case number retrieved using a data parameter.
       - **Attribute Name**: subject
       - **Attribute Value**: Follow up task regrading `$(anchor.ticketnumber)`
    - Description: Combination of a text string and the customer email address retrieved using an oData query.
       - **Attribute Name**: Description
       - **Attribute Value**: Review customer email: `{$odata.contact.emailaddress1.?$filter=contactid eq '{anchor._customerid_value}'}`
    - Regarding: Customer record.
       - **Attribute Name**: regardingobjectid
       - **Attribute Value**: `${anchor.incidentid}`
       - **Attribute Name**: regardingobjectidtype
       - **Attribute Value**: `incident`
       - **Attribute Name**: regardingobjectidname 
       - **Attribute Value**: `${anchor.title}`
2. Add the **Save the record** action. 
 
### Example 2: Create a new case from a conversation  

Perform the following steps to create a macro to open a case from a conversation:
1. Add the **Open a new form to create a record** action with the following attributes:
    - Subject: Conversation retrieved using a data parameter.
      - **Attribute Name**: subject
      - **Attribute Value**: Follow up with `$(customerName)`
    - Description: Combination of a text string and the customer email address retrieved via oData query.
      - **Attribute Name**: Description
      -  **Attribute Value**: Review customer email: `{$odata.contact.emailaddress1.?$filter=contactid eq '{customerRecordid}'}`
   - Regarding: Customer record.
      - **Attribute Name**: regardingobjectid
      -  **Attribute Value**: `${customerRecordid}`
      - **Attribute Name**: regardingobjectidtype
      - **Attribute Value**: `${customerEntityName}`
      - **Attribute Name**: regardingobjectidname
      - **Attribute Value**: `${customerName}`
2. Add the **Save the record** action.

## Open an existing record

Opens an existing record form. The action contains the following fields.

   | Field | Description | 
   |-----------------|-----------------------------|
   | Entity logical name |  Specify the logical name of the entity that you want to open.| 
   | Entity record ID| Specify the entity record ID. | 
   | Entity form ID | Specify the form ID. |

### Example 1: Open the product record from an existing case

To create a macro to open the product record from an existing case, add the **Open an existing record** action that reads the product ID from the case, with the following attributes: 
   - **Entity logical name**: `product`
   - **Entity record ID**: `${anchor._productid_value}` 
 
### Example 2: Open the customer record from a conversation 

To create a macro to open a customer record from an ongoing conversation, add the **Open an existing record** action that reads the customer ID from the conversation, with the following attributes:
  - **Entity record ID**: `${customerEntityName}` 
  - **Entity logical name**: `${customerRecordid}`

## Autofill form fields

Updates form fields. The macro action doesn't automatically save new values in Dataverse until the form triggers the autosave. You can use another macro action to save the record. Alternatively, you can use the **Update existing record** macro based on your business requirements. This action applies to the form in focused tab and has the same entity type mentioned in action.  


   | Field | Description | 
   |-----------------|-----------------------------|
   | Entity logical name | Specify the logical name of the entity that you want to update. | 

> [!NOTE]
> This macro requires a specific pattern to set lookup values. You will need to pass the related record ID, record type, and record name as separate attributes for a single lookup.

### Example 1: Open a task form and populate form fields from case

Perform the following steps to create a macro that opens the task form and then populates the form with values from the anchor tab:
1. Add the **Open a new form to create a record** action that opens a task record, with the following parameters:
    - **Entity logical name**:`task`.
2. Add the **Autofill form fields** that populates the new task record with values from the case form that's the anchor tab, with the following attributes: 
    - **Entity logical name**: `task`
    - **Attribute Name**: subject
    - **Attribute Value**: Follow up task regarding `${anchor.ticketnumber}`
    - **Attribute Name**: regrdingobjectid
    - **Attribute Value**: `{{"id":"${anchor.incidentid}","name":"${anchor.title}","entitytype":"incident"}}`

### Example 2: Open a task form and populate form fields from a conversation

Perform the following steps to create a macro that opens the task form and then populates the form with values from the conversation using data parameters:
1. Add the **Open a new form to create a record** action that opens a task record, with the following parameters:
    - **Entity logical name**:`task`.
2. Add the **Autofill form fields** that populates the new task record with values from the conversation, with the following attributes: 
   - **Entity logical name**: `task`
   - **Attribute Name**: subject
   - **Attribute Value**: Follow up task regarding `${anchor.customerName}`
   - **Attribute Name**: regrdingobjectid
   - **Attribute Value**: `"${customerName}","entitytype":"${customerEntityName}"}}`

#### Update an existing record

Updates an existing record. The action contains the following fields.

   | Field | Description |
   |-----------------|-----------------------------|
   | Entity logical name |  Specify the logical name of the entity that you want to update. <br> This field is mandatory. | 
   | Entity record ID| Specify the entity record ID. <br>This field is mandatory.| 
   | Attribute Name | Specify the attribute logical name you want to update.|
   | Attribute Value | Specify the attribute value that's updated for the above-mentioned attribute. |

> [!NOTE]
> This macro requires a specific pattern to set lookup values. You will need to pass the related record ID, record type, and record name as separate attributes for a single lookup.

### Example 1: Open a task form, create the task, then update the record

Perform the following steps to create a macro that opens the task form and creates a new form and then updates the task form from an existing record:
 
1. Add the **Open a new form to create a record** action that opens a task record, with the following parameters:
     - **Entity logical name**:`task`
1. Add the **Save the record** action.
1. Add the **Update an existing record** that populates the new task record with record ID and logical name from the dynamics content (obtained after the save record action) and the regarding object based on values from the anchor tab, with the following attributes: 
   - **Entity record ID**: `Entity record ID`
   - **Entity logical name**: `Entity logical name`
   - **Attribute Name**: regardingobjectid_incident@odata.bind
   - **Attribute Value**: `/incidents{${anchor.incidentid}}`
1. Add the **Refresh the tab** session action to refresh the task form as the update record macro performs a back-end operation and doesn't automatically refresh the tab.

> [!CAUTION]
> In the example, the form refreshes after the **Save the record action** and the **Refresh the tab** actions. We recommend that you design your macros in such a way to reduce form loading. 
  

## Resolve a case

Use the action to resolve a case. The action contains the following fields.

   | Field | Description | 
   |-----------------|-----------------------------|
   | Billable time |  Specify the time that is billable. <br> This field is mandatory. | 
   | Incident ID| Specify the ID of the case that you want to close. <br>This field is mandatory.| 
   | Resolution | Specify the reason to resolve the case. <br>This field is mandatory. | 


### Example: Macro to resolve a case

Perform the following steps to create a macro that resolves a case. When agents resolve a case using macro, the tab isn't automatically refreshed, so more steps are recommended for a better user experience.

1. Add the **Action to resolve case** action to pass the billable time as a numeric value and the Incident ID is the record ID that needs to be resolved, with the following attributes:
  - **Incident ID**: `${anchor.incidentid}`
  - **Billable time**: 0
  - **Resolution**: `Case${anchor.ticketnumber}` resolved via macros
1. Add the **Get the current tab** session connector.
1. Add the **Refresh the tab** session action to refresh the tab with the following attributes:
    -**Tab ID**: Tab ID

## Open an email form with predefined template

This action is used to open an email with a predefined template. The action contains the following fields.

   | Field | Description |
   |-----------------|-----------------------------|
   | Entity logical name | Specify the logical name of the entity to which email is being sent. <br>This field is mandatory.| 
   | Entity record ID | Specify the record ID of the entity record to which email is being sent.<br>This field is mandatory.| 
   | Email recipients | Specify the display name of the record to which email is being sent. <br>This field is mandatory.| 
   | Template ID | Specify the email template ID of the type of entity to which email is being sent and that must be displayed in the email. <br>This field is mandatory.|

> [!NOTE]
> The **Email recipients** field requires a parameter but doesn't automatically map to a user in the form. We recommend that you use the **autofill form fields** macro to populate the values accordingly. 

### Example 1: Open an email template from a case

Perform the following steps to create a macro that opens an email template of category case:
1. Add the **Open an email form with predefined template** action that adds the template based on the template ID and populates the email form with **To** and **Regarding** fields. The attributes are as follows:
