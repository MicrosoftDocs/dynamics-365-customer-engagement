# Productivity pane overview

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Case information is applicable to Customer Service only.



The productivity pane in Customer Service workspace and Contact Center workspace enables you to display knowledge search, agent scripts, and smart-assist cards in a unified view. Configure knowledge search, agent scripts, and smart-assist cards, so these agent guidance tools will appear in Customer Service workspace and Contact Center workspace.

You can set the productivity pane in collapsed mode or expanded mode, as shown in the following illustrations.

**Collapsed mode**

> [!div class='mx-imgBorder']
> ![Productivity pane in collapsed mode.](../media/productivity-pane-collapsed.PNG "Productivity pane in collapsed mode")

**Expanded mode**

> [!div class='mx-imgBorder']
> ![Productivity pane.](../media/productivity-pane-expanded.png "Productivity pane in expanded mode")
