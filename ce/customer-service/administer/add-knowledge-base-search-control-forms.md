# Add the Knowledge Base Search control to forms

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]


> [!NOTE]
> Follow the steps provided in this article for single-session apps only or to use auto search on non-anchor tabs. For multi-sessions apps, use the [knowledge search control on the app side pane](configure-knowledge-search-control-productivity-pane.md).

Add a **Knowledge Base Search** control to [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] forms to make it easy for users in your organization to find knowledge articles so they can answer common customer questions and resolve their issues right from the records, without having to switch to a different application.  
  
 You can configure the Knowledge Base Search control to:  
  
- Show automatic suggestions in search results based on certain fields, or based on text analytics. The text analytics feature in only available for [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../../includes/pn-crm-online.md)].  
  
- Define filters that users can use on search results.  
  
- Choose from a set of predefined contextual actions the users can take on an article.  
  
- Add the control on any section of any entity that is enabled for knowledge management, including the timeline, and custom entities. The control is enabled in the case entity out of the box, and is added to the following forms:
   - Case main form -  In the **Activity wall** section.
   - Case for interactive experience main form â€“ In the **Related** section.
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > The Knowledge Base Search control can be used on Microsoft Dynamics 365 for tablets and phones. However, some actions like Pop Out, Email Link, and Email Content aren't supported.  

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Service supports the native knowledge management, and this option is available for the Dynamics 365 Customer Service app users.
  
## Prerequisites  

Before you add the Knowledge Base Search control, make sure to:  
  
- Set up knowledge management in [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)]. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Set up knowledge management](set-up-knowledge-management-embedded-knowledge-search.md)
  
- Select the entity you want to enable knowledge management on while setting up knowledge management.  

> [!NOTE]
> All customization tasks for the Customer Service Hub must be done in Microsoft Dataverse.
  
## Add the Knowledge Base Search control to main forms 

Depending on which experience you're using, you can add the knowledge base search control to main forms by using one of the following methods:

   - [Power Apps experience](#power-apps-experience)

   - [Web client experience](#web-client-experience)

### Power Apps experience

Make sure that you have the System Administrator or System Customizer security role or equivalent before you begin.

1. Go to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/), and then on the left pane, select **Data** > **Tables**.

2. Ensure you have the Customer Service App installed, and then in the upper-right corner of the window, change **Default** to **All**.

3. Select the entity for which Knowledge is enabled. To search for the entity, in the **Search** field, enter the entity name.
   
    ![Search for entity.](../media/knowledge-entity.png "Search for entity")
    
4.	Select the entity name, select the **Forms** tab, and then open the form where you want to add the knowledge control. To add the control, create a section and then add a knowledge search control within it. Select **+Component** to add a new component, select **Related Data**, and then **Knowledge Search**. 

   > [!Note]
   > If the option to add Knowledge Base Search is disabled, it could be because knowledge management isn't set up or isn't enabled for the entity for which you're adding the search control. Also, this control won't be enabled for reference panels until a later date.

5. After you add your new section, select **Save and Publish**. You might need to refresh the screen to see the new section.

 
   ![View new section.](../media/Knowledge-control-standardview.png "Knowledge control standard view")

   The knowledge properties now display in the standard view at runtime. 
   
   The following table describes the properties you can configure.
    
|Property  |Description|
|---------|---------|
|Reference name     |**Required**: The unique name for the tab. This name is used when referencing it in scripts. The name must follow these rules:<ul><li>Can't be empty</li><li>Must be a unique name</li><li>Must start with a letter only</li><li>Must contain only alphanumeric characters and underscores</li><li>Can't be greater than 100 characters</li></ul> |
|Label        |**Required**: The localizable label for the tab visible to users. The label must follow these rules:<ul><li>Can't be empty</li><li>Must be a unique name</li><li>Must start with a letter only</li><li>Must contain only alphanumeric characters and underscores</li><li>Can't be greater than 100 characters</li></ul> |

#### Configure automatic filtering for the web client

Improve knowledge article suggestions and search results by enabling automatic filtering. Automatic filtering ensures your representatives receive only the most relevant knowledge articles. As an administrator, you can configure Knowledge Base Search control to automatically filter knowledge articles based on case data without any manual input from the representatives.

For example, if you set up automatic filtering of knowledge articles on the subject of the case, the knowledge articles that have the same subject as the case will be filtered in and will be shown to the representatives. Other articles are filtered out automatically. 

This feature can be extended to automatically filter knowledge articles on any lookup field that's present on both Case and Knowledge Article entities. Representatives also have an option to turn off automatic filtering and search the entire knowledge base. Administrators can configure this option in the Knowledge Base Search control.

Open the **Knowledge Base Search** control and edit its properties to configure automatic filtering. In the **Set Properties** dialog box, on the **Display** tab, specify the following fields in the **Configure Automatic Filtering** section.

1. Select the **Enable Automatic Filtering** check box to enable automatic filtering.
2. Select the **Users can turn off automatic filtering** check box if you want to provide your representatives the option to turn off automatic filtering and search the entire knowledge base. This enables the **Auto filter results** option for representatives on knowledge search control.
3. Select **Add Filter** to define filtering of knowledge articles on case subject or any other lookup field.
4. Select **Set** to save the properties.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Ensure that Relevance search is enabled for automatic filtering to work. The Knowledge Article attribute must be added to the Knowledge Article Quick Find View. Ensure that the Source Entity Attribute is present on the form.

      > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
      > ![Configure auto filtering.](../media/ka-config-auto-filtering.png "Configure auto filtering")

To learn more about how to use the automatic filtering option, go to [View auto-filtered results](../use/filter-articles.md#view-auto-filtered-results)

## Add a knowledge article subgrid to a form

You can add a customized knowledge article subgrid to a form. To learn more about the components of a subgrid form, go to [Add and configure a subgrid component on a form](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/form-designer-add-configure-subgrid).

**To add a subgrid**

1. Sign in to the Dynamics 365 application, and then select **Settings** > **Advanced Settings**.

2. Select **Customizations** from the drop-down list, and then select **Customize the System**.

3. In the **Solution Default Solution** list, select the entity to which you want to add a subgrid, and then select **Forms**.

4. In the form designer, select **Insert** > **Sub-Grid**.

5. In the **Set Properties** dialog box, provide a unique name for your subgrid.

6. Ensure that the **Entity** value is set to **Knowledge Articles**.

7. Retain the default values for all the other fields, and then select **OK**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Set properties for subgrid.](../media/set-properties-for-subgrid.png "Enter the properties for the knowledge article subgrid")

8. Save your knowledge subgrid, and then select **Publish**.

   ![New section in subgrid view.](../media/Knowledge-control-subgridview.png "Knowledge control subgrid view")

The linked knowledge article subgrid that you add will be visible to the customer service representative on the entity form during runtime.

The Knowledge Search tab is available by default on the app side pane.
You can use the knowledge search control either on the app side pane or embed it in the form through customization but make sure that you don't enable both simultaneously. Otherwise, when you try to access the embedded control, the "Error loading the control" message will appear.
