# Install Service Scheduling from Power Platform

You need to perform the installation from the Power Platform admin center for the first time only. Subsequent updates are package-driven and require no manual action.

To install Core Service Scheduling from the Power Platform admin center:

1. Select **Manage** and then select **Dynamics 365 apps**.

2. Under the list of application names, select **Dynamics 365 Service Scheduling**, and then select **Install**.

3. Select the environment where you want to install the latest app (the installation starts with the dev environment). Once the dev instance succeeds, it changes to test and then production.
