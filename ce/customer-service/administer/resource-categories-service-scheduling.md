# Create and manage resource categories 

With bookable resource categories, you can group your bookable resources by type. For example, you can create categories like technician, supervisor, subcontractor, vehicle, or equipment.

## Create a new resource category

Make sure that you have the required security role or equivalent permissions.

    2. In the **Resource categories** section, select **Manage**.
        
        The **Active Resource Categories** view is displayed. You can switch between various system views using the dropdown list.  

   ### [Customer Service Hub](#tab/customerservicehub)

    1. In the site map, go to **Scheduling**.
    2. From the list of entity records, select **Resource categories** in **Scheduling**.

2. On the command bar, select **New** to create a new bookable resource category. 
3. In the **General** section,  provide a **Name** and a **Description** for the resource category.
