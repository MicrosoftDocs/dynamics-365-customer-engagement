# Enable entities for service level agreements (Customer Service)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Service level agreements are not just important in the customer service space, but also for sales and marketing to ensure efficient handling of leads from start to finish.  
  
Previously, you could only create SLAs for case records. With Dynamics CRM Onlin 2016 Update 1, you can now enable any of these entities for SLA:  
  
-   Account  
  
-   Contact  
  
-   Order  
  
-   Invoice  
  
-   Quote  
  
-   Opportunity  
  
-   Lead  
  
-   All activity entities like email, phone, and appointment, except recurring appointment and its instances.  
  
 SLAs can also be enabled for custom entities and custom activities.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Only enhanced SLAs can be created for other entities. A standard SLA can be created only for the Case entity.
