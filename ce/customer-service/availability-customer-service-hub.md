## Preview: Availability of Customer Service Hub

[!include[cc-early-access-2020w1](../includes/cc-early-access-2020w1.md)]

In 2020 release wave 1, the Customer Service Hub solution that is built on the Unified Interface framework will be automatically installed in all the environments that have the web client installed.

The salient features of the integrated solution are as follows:

- Existing customers can access **Customer Service Hub** in their environment. To learn more: [Introduction to Customer Service Hub](user-guide-customer-service-hub).
- Users with the **Customer service app access** security role will be able to view and use the app. To learn about granting or revoking the role, see [Assign a security role to a user](/power-platform/admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles#assign-a-security-role-to-a-user).
- If you delete the app manually, it will be installed automatically during the next update cycle.
