# Service Scheduling features for legacy users

The legacy Service Scheduling experience is currently being deprecated in alignment with the expected Unified Interface transition date of 12/01/2020. More information: [Legacy web client is deprecated](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/important-changes-coming#legacy-web-client-is-deprecated). Because of this change, there are currently two approaches you can take to transition to a new scheduling experience. More information: [Overview of Service Scheduling migration options](../customer-service/scheduling-overview.md).

The following topics contain information about legacy Service Scheduling features:
