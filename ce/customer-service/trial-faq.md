# Dynamics 365 Customer Service trial FAQ

This topic answers your most frequently asked questions about the free product trial of Customer Service and Omnichannel for Customer Service.

[!INCLUDE [trial-platform-faqs](../shared/trials/trial-faq-platform.md)]

### Can I convert the trial to a paid license?

Yes, you can purchase licenses through direct, credit card purchase at admin.microsoft.com. Or, you can work with sales to establish a volume licensing or enterprise agreement. Visit our [Pricing page](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/pricing/) for more information on pricing and purchasing.

To purchase the license using an existing account, work with the administrator of the account to apply for licenses.

After you have applied for the license to your tenant, you can publish your environment to production. You can remove the sample data. However, you have to manually reset the configuration and remove any test data that you've added. We recommend that you create a fresh environment to use for your production environment and add the configurations you’d like to move forward with.

### What are the trial limits and quotas?

The following limitations apply for the trial:

- The trial is available to you for 30 days. After that, you can request for an extension for another 30 days, buy a paid license, or sign up for a new trial.
- The trial will expire if there’s no activity on the app for 14 consecutive days. Expired trials cannot be reactivated. However, you can start a new trial.
- You can have only one active trial per app at a time. You can sign up again after your current trial for the app ends.

## Customer Service-specific questions

### How do I remove sample data from the trial instance?

Your trial environment has been curated to provide you with a fully functional application to ensure you can discover the business value of Customer Service right away. Sample data is provided to ensure all features are fully illustrated for you to learn how the product works as if it were deployed to many users in your organization and with existing customer interactions. Because this is a real environment, you can manually add or delete individual data records in your trial environment as you want. There is no option to bulk delete the sample data and configurations from the trial environments.

### How do I reset or reimport sample data?

Sample data comes with the trial environment and experience. To get a fresh dataset, you must wait for your trial to expire and start a new trial.
