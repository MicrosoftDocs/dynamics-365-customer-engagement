# Try channels 

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

Channels, like Live Chat, voice, and SMS, are engagement channels that let your agents connect with customers in real time and provide quick personalized help.

You can perform the following steps to try channels in Customer Service:

1. Sign up for a free 30-day trial of channels through Microsoft 365 admin center.

1. [Provision channels](#provision-channels-in-your-organization).


## Channels trial through Microsoft 365 admin center

The Dynamics 365 Customer Service Digital Messaging Add-on Trial is a free 30-day trial of Chat, SMS, and social channels that you can download from the Microsoft 365 admin center.

### Prerequisites for trial through Microsoft 365 admin center

You must obtain one of the following subscriptions through the Microsoft 365 admin center (that is, Web Direct):

- Paid or trial subscription of Dynamics 365 Customer Service Enterprise
- Paid or trial subscription of Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement
- For voice channel, subscription of Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement Applications Trial
- For voice channel, make sure that trial is supported in the [cloud location](../administer/voice-channel-region-availability.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you don't have one of these subscriptions, or if you purchased your subscription somewhere other than Web Direct, then the option to try channels isn't be available in the Microsoft 365 admin center. In such cases, we recommend that you use the [Customer Service trial](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/customer-service/overview/).

For information about the Digital Messaging license, pricing, and prerequisites, see the [Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=866544).
