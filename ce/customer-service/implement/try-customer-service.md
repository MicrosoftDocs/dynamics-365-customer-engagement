# Sign up for a free Dynamics 365 Customer Service trial

Dynamics 365 Customer Service offers a 30-day free trial. After a quick sign-up, you'll have access to many of the app's key features. The trial allows you to test the app with sample data and even try out your own customer data. [Learn more about what Customer Service has to offer](/dynamics365/customer-service/overview).
