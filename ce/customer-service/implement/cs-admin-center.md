# Get started with Customer Service admin center

Welcome to Customer Service admin center, the app that unifies and simplifies administration experience across the Customer Service suite.

Use the Customer Service admin center app to set up the features in Customer Service, such as unified routing, cases, queues, knowledge articles, channels, rules for automatic record creation, agent experience profiles, and customer service schedules.

The features include:  

- Step-by-step guided experience for setting up a channel.

- Search option to easily find the administrator settings for the various features in the app.

- Task-oriented site map.

- Overview pages for each area that list at-a-glance information with deep links to manage features.

- Landing pages per feature with an overview of all the capabilities.

- The site map adapts to the capabilities that are provisioned. Based in core Customer Service, if Omnichannel for Customer Service is provisioned, then other features are automatically available.
