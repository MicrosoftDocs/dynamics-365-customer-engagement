# Set up knowledge management (Customer Service)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

A comprehensive knowledge base is a key to increased customer satisfaction and improved productivity of users. Give users quick access to the knowledge base by setting up knowledge management in [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)].  
  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] supports two knowledge management solutions that you can choose from:  
  
-   Native [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] knowledge management. This option is available for [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] users. For [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] organizations, the native [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] knowledge solution is only available if you've updated to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_2016_update_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-2016-update-shortest.md)].
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_parature](../includes/pn-parature.md)] knowledgebase. This option is available only for [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] users. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Usage of [!INCLUDE[pn_parature](../includes/pn-parature.md)] knowledgebase as a knowledge management solution for [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] has been deprecated. For more information, see [Important changes coming](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/get-started/whats-new/customer-engagement/important-changes-coming).
  
After knowledge management is set up, users will be able to:  
  
-   Search for relevant KB articles right from [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] as they're working on a record.  
  
-   See the content of the KB article inline, including images and videos.  
  
-   Give timely and consistent information to customers when working on their cases by using actions like opening the article and sharing the information or emailing the article link to customers.

## Set up knowledge management  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_permissions_system_admin_and_customizer](../includes/proc-permissions-system-admin-and-customizer.md)] You must also be the tenant administrator of [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Office_365](../includes/pn-ms-office-365.md)].  
  
2. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_service_management](../includes/proc-settings-service-management.md)]  
  
3.  Under **Knowledge Base Management**, click **Embedded Knowledge Search**.  
  
4.  In the **Knowledge Base Management Settings** wizard, in **Record Types**, select the record types you want to turn on knowledge management for. The list will include all entities that are available for an N:N relationship. Knowledge management is enabled for case entity by default.  
  
5.  Under **Knowledge Source**, in the **Knowledge Solution** field, select the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] native knowledge solution.  
  
6.  In the **Support Portal Connection** section, enter the following:  
  
    - **Use an external portal**. You can integrate an external portal for publishing knowledge articles. If your organization uses one, select this check box.  
  
    - **URL Format**. Type the portal URL that will be used to create external (public-facing) portal links for knowledge articles, which the service agents can share with the customers. The external URL is created in the following format: http://\<support portal URL>/kb/{kbnum}  
  
         The placeholder "{kbnum}" is replaced by an actual knowledge article number.  
  
8.  Click **Next**.  
  
9. If youâ€™ve specified the details correctly, the page shows the connection details for [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. Click **Finish** to complete the setup.
