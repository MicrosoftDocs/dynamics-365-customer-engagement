# Schedule a service activity (Customer Service app)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Use this form to search for an available time for a service activity. You can either search for an open time using search criteria that, at a minimum, includes selecting a service, or you can define a more complex set of criteria. You can also create a service activity without checking for conflicts in the scheduled service. The service activity appears as a color block on the service calendar  
 
> [!NOTE]
> With the October'18 release, the new Service Scheduling is now available in the Customer Service Hub sitemap. We recommend that you create service activities using the new experience. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Schedule a service activity](schedule-service-activity-csh.md)

 
You can’t create a recurring service activity. Create individual service activities as needed.
