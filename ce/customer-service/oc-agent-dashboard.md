# View agent dashboard and agent conversations (work items)

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

The Omnichannel Agent Dashboard is a default view when you sign in to the application. The dashboard displays the following streams:

- My work items

- Open work items

- Closed work items

## My work items

In this stream, you see the conversations (work items) that you are actively working on. Select the ellipses and select the **Open** option to open the work item in a session.

## Open work items

In this stream, you see the conversations (work items) in a open state from all queues in which you are added as a member. Select the ellipses and select the **Assign to me** option to assign the work item to yourself. When you select a work item, you get a notification, and when you accept it, a session starts and customer summary or case page loads. 

The work item that you picked is moved from the **Open work items** stream to the **My work items** stream. If you reject the request, then the work item remains in the **Open work items** stream.

## Closed work items

In the **Closed work items** stream, you see all the conversations that you've closed in the past 24 hours. To view a closed work item, select the ellipsis button (**...**) for it, and then select **Open** to view the details.

## Sort work items

On the dashboard, you can sort the work items by the following categories:

- Modified On
- Work distribution mode (For open work items only)
- Customer
- Work stream
- Created On
- Transfer Count
