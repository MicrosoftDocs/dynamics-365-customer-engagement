# View agent dashboard and agent conversations (work items)

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

The Omnichannel Agent Dashboard is a default view when you sign in to the application. The dashboard displays the following streams:

- My work items
- Open work items
- Closed work items

## My work items

In the **My work items** section, you can see the conversations (work items) that you are actively working on. Select the ellipses and select the **Open** option to open the work item in a session.

## Open work items

In the **Open work items** section, you can see the conversations (work items) that are in an open state from all queues in which you are added as a member. Select the ellipses and select the **Assign to me** option to assign the work item to yourself. When you select a work item, you get a notification, and when you accept it, a session starts and customer summary or case page loads.

The work item that you pick is moved from the **Open work items** section to the **My work items** section. If you reject the request, then the work item remains in the **Open work items** section.

## Closed work items

In the **Closed work items** section, you can see all the conversations that you've closed on the same day. To view a closed work item, select the ellipsis button (**...**) for it, and then select **Open** to view the details.

When you open a record from the **Closed work items** section, you can view the attributes of the closed conversation record. This will not re-open or re-activate the conversation.

## Sort work items

On the dashboard, you can sort the work items by the following categories:

- Modified On
- Work distribution mode (For open work items only)
- Customer
- Work stream
- Created On
- Transfer Count
