# Create or change a queue (Customer Service)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Make sure that activities or unresolved cases are acted upon faster by using queues in [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)].  
  
 Queues can be useful in:  
  
-   Having a centralized list of pending work that needs attention  
  
-   Sorting tasks by type or by the people assigned to complete them  
  
Use queues to categorize and prioritize your activities and cases. You can categorize based on:  
  
-   Different products or services  
  
-   Different subscription levels (regular, premium customers)  
  
-   Various activity categories  
  
-   Different geography  
  
> [!TIP]
>  You can use an [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] shared mailbox when you create a queue in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] and not consume an [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] license for a forwarding email account.

## Create or change a queue  
  
1. Make sure that you have the Sales or Marketing Manager, Customer Service Manager, System Administrator, or System Customizer security role or equivalent permissions.  
  
   #### Check your security role  
  
   - [!INCLUDE[proc_follow_steps_in_link](../includes/proc-follow-steps-in-link.md)]  
  
   - [!INCLUDE[proc_dont_have_correct_permissions](../includes/proc-dont-have-correct-permissions.md)]  
  
2. Go to **Settings** > **Service Management**.  
  
3. [!INCLUDE[proc_click_or_tap_queues](../includes/proc-click-or-tap-queues.md)]  
  
4. To create a new queue, click **New**.  
  
    -OR-  
  
    To edit a queue, in the list of queues, click the queue, and then on the command bar, click **Edit**.  
  
5. Type or change information in the text boxes.  
  
    Hovertips provide hints about what to enter.  
  
   - In the **Summary** section, complete the required fields.  
  
   - In the **Name** field, type the name of the queue.  
  
   - In the **Type** field, choose if the queue is a private or public queue. You can use a private queue to allow only a specific set of people to work on activities in this queue.  
  
      If you’re creating a private queue, you’ll need to add members to this queue manually. In the **Members** section, click the **Add** button **+** to add members to the queue. Only these members will be able to work on the items in this queue.  
  
     > [!NOTE]
     >  The email address you enter in the **Incoming Email** field receives all messages sent to the queue.  
  
   - In the **Email Settings** section, in the **Convert to email activities** drop-down list, choose which messages to track as activities.  
  
   - In the **Mailbox** field, a mailbox record for the queue is automatically created and selected as soon as you save the queue record. To update the mailbox details, click the mailbox name. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Create forward mailboxes or edit mailboxes](../admin/create-forward-mailboxes-edit-mailboxes.md)  
  
   - In the **Record creation and update rules** section, add a **Record Creation and Update Rule** record. By using these rules, you can automatically create or update system or custom records from incoming [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] activities, such as emails, social activities, or custom activities. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Set up rules to automatically create or update records](../customer-service/set-up-rules-to-automatically-create-or-update-records.md)  
  
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   >  This is a central place to manage rules across all supported activities including out-of-the-box and custom activities associated with the queue.  
   >  The **Record creation and update rules** section displays rules using the **Email Activity Conversation Setting**  or **Social Activity Conversation Setting** and that have the same queue ID as the queue.   
   >  Multiple rules with the same source type and same queue can exist. Therefore, when you click **Email Activity Conversion Settings** or **Social Activity Conversion Settings**, the rule with the latest **Last Modified On** date is applied.  
  
6. [!INCLUDE[proc_click_or_tap_save](../includes/proc-click-or-tap-save.md)]  
  
## View queue items  
 In the **Queue Items** section, all activities that are either routed to this queue automatically by the routing rules or the activities that are manually assigned to this queue will be listed here.  
  
## Additional actions  
 To create records for this queue, on the command bar, click **Email Activity Conversation Settings** or **Social Activity Conversation Settings**.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Set up rules to automatically create or update records](../customer-service/set-up-rules-to-automatically-create-or-update-records.md) or [Automatically create a case from an email](../customer-service/automatically-create-case-from-email.md)
