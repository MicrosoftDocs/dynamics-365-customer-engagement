# Overview of collaboration

Collaboration features make it easy for agents to find the help they need in Microsoft Teams from within the following apps:
- Dynamics 365 Customer Service admin center
- Dynamics 365 Customer Service Hub
- Dynamics 365 Customer Service workspace
- Your custom apps

Using collaboration features, agents can find experts, chat with peers in Teams, and set meetings. Collaboration helps turn your business into a unified and cohesive customer service center. 

## Embedded chat using Teams

Agents can start a new chat or link an existing chat to a record in Teams without switching context or leaving the application. Linking all the associated chats to a record can help agents maintain the chats in one place. More information: [Configure Teams chat](configure-teams-chat.md)

## Customer support swarming using Teams

Customer support swarming helps agents more quickly resolve issues by bringing together the right experts across your business. More information: [Configure customer support swarming](configure-customer-support-swarming.md)

## Share Dynamics 365 records within Microsoft Teams conversations

Agents can share the record of the chat conversation and let participants view it without navigating away from Teams. They can share any Dynamics 365 record on Teams channels and chat conversations, and share records using search in the app. More information: [Share Dynamics 365 records within Microsoft Teams conversations](/dynamics365/sales/teams-integration/share-d365-record-overview?context=/dynamics365/context/customer-service-context)
