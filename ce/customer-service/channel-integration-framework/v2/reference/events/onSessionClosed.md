# onSessionClosed event (JavaScript API reference) for Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework 2.0

Invoked by the client when a session is closed. This handler will pass the `sessionClosed` message to the widget as an event resulting in the registered widget-side handler, if any, being invoked.
