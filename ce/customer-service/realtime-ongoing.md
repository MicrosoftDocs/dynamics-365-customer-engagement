# View and understand the Ongoing Conversation report in Omnichannel real-time analytics

The **Ongoing Conversation** report provides information about the conversations that are currently handled by agents in your organization and are in the open, active, wrap-up, and waiting statuses. This report provides a holistic view of the conversations in real time with details, such as subject, status, active agent details, queue, channel, wait time, handle time, and customer sentiment.
