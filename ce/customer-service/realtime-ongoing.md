# View and understand the Ongoing conversation report in Omnichannel real-time analytics

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

The **Ongoing conversation** report provides information about the status of conversations that are currently being handled by agents in your organization, and that aren't yet closed. The conversation status can be open, active, wrap-up, or waiting.

This report provides a holistic view of the conversations in real time. It includes details such as the subject, status, active agent details, queue, channel, wait time, handle time, and customer sentiment. For more information, go to [Overview of Omnichannel real-time analytics dashboards](intro-realtime-analytics-dashboard.md).

The conversation list shows current ongoing conversations from the last 24 hours. Therefore, managers have a real-time view of the interactions between agents and customers. You can also select an agent and then use the following buttons to perform different actions on conversations:

- **Assign**: Assign an incoming, unassigned conversation to either a queue or an agent.
- **Transfer**: Transfer an ongoing conversation from one agent to another.
- **Monitor**: Listen to an ongoing conversation. When you select **Monitor**, you receive a message that states that monitoring has begun. This action is applicable only to active conversations with agent acceptance, conversations that are in a wrap-up state, and conversations that are in a waiting state.
- **Force close**: Forcibly close a conversation by closing the work item. When you select **Force close**, a confirmation message box appears. You must select **Proceed** to close the work item. When you forcibly close a conversation, the conversation immediately ends for the customer too. We recommend that you use this action with caution.
