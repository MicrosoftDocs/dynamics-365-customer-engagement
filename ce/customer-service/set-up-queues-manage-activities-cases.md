# Queues overview (Customer Service)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Use queues to organize, prioritize, and monitor the progress of your work. In [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)], queues are containers used to store anything that needs to be completed or requires an action, for example completing a task or closing a case.  
  
## Create queues  
 By default, a queue is created for each user and team in [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)]. You can use this default queue to track all your work items, or you can set up queues to reflect your organization's structure, business processes, or both. How you set up queues depends on how your business works. For example, you could create separate queues for First Tier and Second Tier product support teams that reflect their differing levels of expertise, or Gold and Silver queues to reflect differing priorities based on service contracts that customers have with your organization.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] lets you create two types of queues: private or public. Create private queues with limited sets of members to let only those members view the items in the queue.  Create public queues to let everyone in the organization view the items in a queue.  
  
## Route items to queues  
 For all cases that are automatically created from incoming email and social posts, create routing rules to route the cases to queues. Then assign the items in the queue to appropriate CSRs or users. Alternatively, you can manually add cases and activities to queues.  
  
## Assign items in the queue to work  
 Queues share cases or activities as a group until these are taken out of the queue, or accepted, by a customer service representative (CSR) who assumes responsibility for handling them. CSRs can pick the items for themselves, or a customer service manager (CSM) can manually route these cases to the CSRs or to other queues, users, or teams.
