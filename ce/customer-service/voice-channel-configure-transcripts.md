## Introduction

As an administrator, you can enable live transcription and recording of calls, which allows agents and supervisors to view transcripts of customer calls.

> [!NOTE]
> Many countries and states have laws and regulations that apply to the recording of PSTN, voice, and video calls, and may require that users first consent to the recording of their communications. It is your responsibility to use the call recording capabilities in compliance with the law. Before using call recording features, you must obtain consent from the parties of recorded communications in a manner that complies with all applicable laws for each participant.

## Enable call recordings and transcripts for voice

2. Select the workstream for which you want to enable recordings and transcripts.
3. In the **Phone number** section, next to the pencil icon, select **Edit**.
