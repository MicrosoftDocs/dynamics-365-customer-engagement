### Generate a chat response

Select the one-click response generation button at the lower-right corner of the Conversation control panel and at the lower-left corner of the Copilot pane. Copilot analyzes the context of the conversation and the latest customer question or message, and drafts a response to send directly to the customer. You don't need to manually type the question.

> [!NOTE]
> The one-click response generation feature is available in North America, Europe, and the United Kingdom only.
