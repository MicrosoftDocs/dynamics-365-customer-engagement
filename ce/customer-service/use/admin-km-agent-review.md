# Review knowledge articles created by the Customer Knowledge Management Agent

You can review knowledge articles created by the Customer Knowledge Management Agent. When you resolve a case, the Customer Knowledge Management Agent creates a new article based on your case, if the agent determines that it fills a knowledge gap.

## Prerequisites

- Your administrator configured Review permissions.
- You're using out-of-the-box timeline.

## Review knowledge articles

1. For a resolved case, go to the case **Timeline**.
1. Select the **Suggested actions** tab.
   The **Suggested actions** tab appears only if there's a suggested action. 
1. Select **Review draft**.
1. In the **Review knowledge draft** dialog that appears, you can review and edit the article and make any rich text edits.
1. Optionally, you can use Copilot to automatically edit the article by entering instructions in **Revise with instructions** and then select **Re-generate**. For example, you can prompt Copilot to make the content more concise, and then select **Re-generate**.
1. Select **Mark as reviewed**. Or, if you have the required permissions, you can select **Split** and publish the article.
