# View and understand real-time analytics for record routing in the backlog work items report 

The Backlog work items report is similar to the Ongoing work items report, with focus on all work items created in the last two days. You can filter content by created on, queue, agent, work item skill, and time zone. [Learn how to access the report](rr-overview.md#access-reports).

Besides filtering, the report also provides the following KPIs to track all-up volumes within the selected filter. 


|KPIs  |Description |
|---------|---------|
|Total work items   | Total number of work items created in the last two days.|
|Assigned work items  | Number of work items created in the last two days that are currently assigned. |
|Unassigned work items    | Number of work items created in the last two days that aren't yet assigned. |
|Agents online   |   Number of agents online at the moment.|

It allows you to easily identify overall case or record volume, and provides easy identification of unassigned work items for triage based on priority.
