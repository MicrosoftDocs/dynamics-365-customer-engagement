# Schedule time off 

You can schedule a period of time in the middle of a schedule when a resource is not available to be scheduled for a service activity. For a user, this could be a sick day or vacation. For a facility or equipment, this could be an equipment failure.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Service scheduling has been deprecated. For more information, see [Important changes coming](/dynamics365/get-started/whats-new/customer-engagement/important-changes-coming).

3.  Choose **Facilities/Equipment**.  
  
4.  In the list, open the resource you want to modify.  
  
5.  Under **Common**, click **Work Hours**.  
  
6.  On the **Monthly View** tab, select a date on the calendar.  
  
7.  On the Actions toolbar, click **Set Up** > **Time Off**, and then in the **Schedule Time Off** dialog box, enter the following details:  
  
    - **Reason**. Type a short explanation for the resource’s absence.  
  
    - **All Day Event**. Select this check box if the resource is unavailable for the entire day (midnight to midnight) for all of the days.  
  
    - **Start Time** and **End Time**. If you have not selected the **All Day Event** check box, you can set specific start and end times. When the end date is reached, the previous schedule continues.  
  
    - **Duration**. If you don’t want to calculate the end date, select the number of days the resource is unavailable.  
  
    - **Time Zone**. If the resource is in a different time zone, select the time zone. The application automatically adjusts the times on the calendars.  
  
8.  Click **OK**.  
  
     In the working hours calendar, affected days are marked with a red block. In the Service calendar the time appears as a white block and cannot be scheduled.  
  
     You can update your own working hours or time off, and add yourself to teams and resource groups. On the **Tools** menu, click **Options**. On the **General** tab, at the bottom of the page, click the **user information** link.
