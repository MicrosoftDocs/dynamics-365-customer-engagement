## Topic automation to Copilot Studio

AI-discovered topics in Omnichannel Historical Analytics are often prime candidates as topics for automation in Copilot Studio bots. If Copilot Studio is available in the region that your Customer Service organization is in, the feature can be enabled by your organization's administrator.  

After a topic is identified as a good automation candidate, the automation workflow can be triggered by selecting Copilot Studio on the **Topics** metrics grid or by selecting **Details** and then **Automate to Bot** in the drill -down view. This will open the topic editing form.

Suggested trigger phrases and the topics related to the case title are provided. The first step is to select the Copilot Studio bot that's ideal for adding the topic to. If no bot exists, select **Create Bot**. You'll be redirected to the Copilot Studio application for bot creation. You can modify both the topic name and trigger phrases, and in the case of trigger phrases; you can add additional ones. After this step is complete, select **Automate Continue** . The Copilot Studio topic will redirect to Copilot Studio for completion of authoring.

> Bots created through the Microsoft Teams channel won't be listed in the bot selection list.
