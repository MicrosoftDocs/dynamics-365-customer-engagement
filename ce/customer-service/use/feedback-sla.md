# Manage feedback for knowledge articles

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]


Manage feedback received for your articles by adding it to your knowledge articles. Update your knowledge articles based on feedback to make the articles more useful for customer service representatives.

## Add feedback to an article

1. In Customer Service workspace or Contact Center workspace, select **Knowledge Articles**.

1. Select the article you want to add feedback for.

1. In the **Feedback** subgrid, select **Create Feedback**. You can also select ![Add a record button.](../media/add-recordbutton.gif "Add a record button") in the navigation bar and then go to **Feedback** to create a feedback item.  
  
1. In the **Quick Create: Feedback** dialog, fill in the following information:  
  
   - **Title**: Enter a descriptive title for the feedback.  
   
   - **Regarding**: Look for relevant records with which to associate the feedback.
  
   - **Source**: Select whether the feedback is internal or from a portal. If you received the feedback through a phone call, select **Internal**.  
  
   - **Comments**: Type any feedback comments that you want.  
  
   - **Rating**: Type a number to specify how useful the related record is. For example, if you're tracking the customer satisfaction for a case and you want to rate it a two on a scale of 1–10, type 2.  
  
   - **Minimum Rating** and **Maximum Rating**: Specify the minimum and maximum ratings to define a rating scale. For example, if you want to give feedback a rating of 2 on the scale of 1–10, type 1 as the minimum rating and 10 as the maximum.  
  
   - **Created by (Contact)**: If you're creating the feedback on behalf of a customer contact, select the contact here.  
  
        The **Created By** and **Closed By** fields are automatically populated with the user who creates or deactivates the feedback record.  
  
   - Dynamics 365 Customer Service automatically calculates the **Normalized Rating** based on the following formula: **(Rating - Minimum Rating)/ (Maximum Rating - Minimum Rating)**.  
  
1. Select **Save and Close**.
