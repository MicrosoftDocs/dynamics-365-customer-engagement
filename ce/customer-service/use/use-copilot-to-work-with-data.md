# Use Copilot to work with data

Enable the following AI features in Power Platform admin center or Power Apps as applicable and then use them in Dynamics 365 Customer Service or Dynamics 365 Contact Center.

## Use AI assistance to fill forms

Copilot suggests field values on the case form based on the following factors:

- App usage, information that's already available in the form, and frequently used data. The feature doesn't require any input from users.
- Copied text that the user provides through the smart paste capability.
- File contents that the user provides through the files (Preview) capability.

Learn how to enable the feature in [Manage AI form fill assistance](/power-platform/admin/settings-features?tabs=new#ai-form-fill-assistance).

## Use Copilot visualization to view data in grids (preview)

Copilot lets you visualize the data in the view in the form of a chart to help you understand trends, patterns, and relations in your data.

Select **Visualize** on any of the case views forms. The chart pane appears next to the grid, complementing the table of rows.

Learn how to enable the feature in [Natural language grid and view search (preview)](/power-platform/admin/settings-features?tabs=new#natural-language-grid-and-view-search-preview).

## Visualize or find data with natural language (preview)

Use natural language prompts in the Copilot bar on the grid page to visualize data in a view. Learn more in [Visualize data in a view with natural language](/power-apps/user/visualize-data-in-copilot#visualize-data-in-a-view-with-natural-language).

Use smart grid natural language search to find, filter, and sort your data quickly with natural language. Learn more in [Find data in a view with AI (preview)](/power-apps/user/find-data-with-ai).

## Use row summaries

Use the row summary feature that provides a concise, AI-generated overview of key details about a record. These summaries help you quickly understand essential information that otherwise requires you to manually scan fields, related records, or activity timelines. Summaries appear as a paragraph or list for easy consumption. Learn more in [Use row summaries](/power-apps/user/record-summaries).

Learn how to enable the feature in [Configure a row summary](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/configure-form-row-summary#create-a-row-summary).
