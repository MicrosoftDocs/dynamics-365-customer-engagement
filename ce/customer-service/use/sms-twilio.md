# Use SMS channels

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes](../../includes/cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes.md)]

> [!Important]
> The Telesign channel was deprecated and removed from Omnichannel for Customer Service on October 8, 2024. Learn more at [Deprecations in Customer Service](../implement/deprecations-customer-service.md).

When you sign in, your work items display in the agent dashboard. To learn more, go to [View agent dashboard and agent conversations (work items)](oc-agent-dashboard.md).

## Prerequisite

Make sure your administrator configured a Twilio channel.

### Incoming chat notifications

You receive a notification when a customer requests a conversation through Twilio. You can accept the chat request, after which a session starts and the communication panel opens, where you can exchange messages with the customer.
