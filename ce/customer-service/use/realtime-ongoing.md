# View and understand the Ongoing conversation report in Omnichannel real-time analytics

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

The **Ongoing conversation** report shows ongoing conversations from the last 24 hours that are currently being handled by customer service representatives (service representatives) in your organization and that aren't yet closed. The report displays those conversations that have the open, active, wrap-up, or waiting status. Learn more in [Understand conversation states](oc-conversation-state.md).

This report provides a holistic view of the conversations in real time. It includes details about subject, status, active service representative details, queue, channel, wait time, handle time, and customer sentiment. Learn more in [Overview of Omnichannel real-time analytics dashboards](intro-realtime-analytics-dashboard.md).

> [!NOTE]
> - Only digital messaging, chat, and voice channels are supported. Record routing isn't supported.
> - The reports are prefiltered based on the queues you are logged in to as a supervisor. So you'll see metrics and conversations relevant to the assigned queues only.

You can perform different actions, such as assign or transfer a conversation, as described in the following sections.

## Assign or transfer conversations

You can view service representative skills and proficiency, availability, and available capacity. These insights help you effectively manage and allocate resources. You can assign or transfer conversations to service representatives who are part of the current queue only. You can manage the queues for service representatives. Learn more in [Manage users](../administer/users-user-profiles.md#manage-contact-center-users).

Refer to the following table to see when assign and transfer are enabled, depending on the various conversation states.

|Type  |Conversation state  |Assign |Transfer |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Record     |     Open     | Assign to queue        |     Not enabled    |
|Record   |      Open   | Assign to agent        |     Not enabled    |
|Record     |     Active    |   Not enabled       |    Transfer to agent     |
|Record     |   Wrap-up      |      Not enabled     |      Not enabled     |

### Assign conversations

1. In the Contact Center workspace or Customer Service workspace app, go to the dashboard view selector, and then select the **Ongoing Conversations** report.

1. Select a conversation in an **Open** state, and then select **Assign**.

1. In the **Assign conversations** dialog, select **Find an agent** or **Find a queue**. If you select **Find an agent**, only those service representatives whose presence matches with one of the allowed presence values in the workstream configuration are displayed.

1. Select **Assign**.

### Transfer conversations

Once a conversation is assigned to an agent, it's in the **Active** state. You can select the conversation and transfer it. 

1. Select a conversation in the **Active** state, and then select **Transfer**. 

1. In the **Transfer conversation** dialog, select an agent from the list of service representatives that appears. 
    A list of service representatives belonging to the same queue and whose presence matches with one of the allowed presence values in the workstream configuration is displayed.

      :::image type="content" source="../media/realtime-agent-transfer.png" alt-text="Screenshot of agent transfer dialog.":::  

1. Select **Transfer**. The system transfers the selected conversation to the agent.

## Monitor conversations

Listen to an ongoing conversation. When you select **Monitor**, you receive a message that indicates that monitoring started. This action is applicable to active conversations that the service representative accepted, conversations that are in a wrap-up state, and conversations that are in a waiting state only. If you have the agent app open in multiple tabs or browsers, the monitored conversation opens in the one where you select **Monitor**. Other browsers remain as-is.


1. From the dashboard view selector, select the **Ongoing Conversations** report. The list of conversations that your service representatives are currently handling appears.

1. Select a conversation that you want to monitor, and then select **Monitor**. The conversation page opens.

1. Optionally, to join a conversation, select **Join chat** in the communication panel.

    Both the service representative and the customer receive notifications when you join a conversation. Depending on your requirements, you can consult with the service representative and customer. Learn more in [View communication panel](oc-conversation-control.md).

## Force close conversations

> [!CAUTION]
> We recommend that you use the **Force close** option cautiously.

Forcibly close a conversation by closing the work item. When you select **Force close**, a confirmation message appears. You must select **Proceed** to close the work item. When you forcibly close a conversation, the conversation immediately ends for the customer too. 

1. From the dashboard view selector, select the **Ongoing Conversations** report.

2. Select a conversation and then select **Force Close**.

The participants receive a notification that a supervisor ended their conversation.
