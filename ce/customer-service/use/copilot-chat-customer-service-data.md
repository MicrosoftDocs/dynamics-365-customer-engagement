[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](../../../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-note-d365.md)]

This article explains how to use Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 to chat with case data by using the Customer Service plugin.

Copilot for Microsoft 365 works across Microsoft 365 apps to help you unlock business scenarios in your organization.

The Customer Service plugin works together with Copilot for Microsoft 365 to help you:

- Deliver a consistent customer experience in every conversation with your customers.
- Connect customer data and insights across the company.
- Provide a natural user experience, in your tools of choice.

## Prerequisites 

You must meet the following prerequisites to use the Customer Service plugin with Copilot for Microsoft 365.

- Your administrator must deploy the Dynamics 365 Service app. More information: [Build plugins using Microsoft business applications](/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/overview-business-applications#deploy-a-plugin)

## Supported data types

Data that resides inside tables is referred to as *structured data*. Data that's present in static documents, such as Word and PDF files, is referred to as *unstructured data*. The Customer Service plugin mainly supports structured data for now.
