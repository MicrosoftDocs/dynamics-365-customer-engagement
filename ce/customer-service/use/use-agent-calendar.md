# Use the Schedule Calendar

As a customer service representative (service representative or representative), it's helpful to know your work schedule, breaks, trainings, and other activities. If your administrator enabled the Schedule Calendar view, you can quickly see your work hours, nonwork hours, and any scheduled time off.

> [!Note]
> The Schedule Calendar isn't supported in the Government Community Cloud (GCC) or sovereign clouds.

The following read-only views are available:

- **Day**: Displays the shifts and activities scheduled for the current day.
- **Week**: Displays the entire week’s shifts, which can help you plan and manage your time effectively.
- **Month**: Provides a high-level overview of the month's schedule, including shifts and time-off requests.
- **Agenda**: Provides a list of scheduled shifts and activities to make it easy to quickly view tasks.

## View the calendar

1. In the site map of Copilot Service workspace, select **Schedule Calendar** under **Workforce Management**. The Schedule Calendar page appears.

2. (Optional) Use the top-right menu to change the view to **Agenda**, **Day**, **Week**, or **Month**.
