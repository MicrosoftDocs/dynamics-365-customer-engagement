# Understand the knowledge article creation process

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]


With the knowledge management module, you can create and manage knowledge articles that your users may be looking for. This ability helps reduce the call handling times for customer service representatives and increases their productivity, as they can look up information in a knowledge base to resolve customer queries right away.

## Default process

The following image describes the default process to create and use knowledge articles in your app. Create an article and mark it for review. The reviewer can approve or reject the article. If the article is rejected, it returns to you for edits or updates. If the article is approved, it publishes on the portal, becomes available in search, and can be translated.
