# Historical analytics for unified routing in Customer Service

With the introduction of unified routing, an advanced and elaborate set of capabilities are available for organizations to enhance their routing configurations. Supervisors and business administrators need metrics to track how these advanced routing capabilities are helping their businesses serve their customers.

In Customer Service, the report displays metrics pertaining to only those records that are routed using unified routing.

## Unified routing report in Customer Service historical analytics

The Unified routing report provides routing-specific KPIs and metrics that can be used by supervisors and administrators to track the success of their routing strategy. They can also track the incorrectly routed work items and configurations and correct them to improve the routing effectiveness and thereby customer satisfaction.

The report appears as a tab in the Customer Service historical analytics report if your administrator has enabled the corresponding setting on the **Insights** page in Customer Service Hub. You can access the report in Service. In the site map, select **Customer Service historical analytics**, and then select **Unified routing**.
