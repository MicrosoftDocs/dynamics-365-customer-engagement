> This feature is intended to help customer service managers or supervisors enhance their team's performance and improve customer satisfaction. This feature is not intended for use in making, and should not be used to make, decisions that affect the employment of an employee or group of employees, including compensation, rewards, seniority, or other rights or entitlements. Customers are solely responsible for using Dynamics 365 Customer Service, this feature, and any associated feature or service in compliance with all applicable laws, including laws relating to accessing individual employee analytics and monitoring, recording, and storing communications with end users. This also includes adequately notifying end users that their communications with agents may be monitored, recorded, or stored and, as required by applicable laws, obtaining consent from end users before using the feature with them. Customers are also encouraged to have a mechanism in place to inform their agents that their communications with end users may be monitored, recorded, or stored.


The Agent dashboard shows charts and KPIs that you can use to guide agents and understand overall agent performance.

## Agent drill-down view

The Agent drill-down view provides supervisors with a holistic look into individual agent performance on metrics and can be valuable in training or coaching scenarios for agents.  

To access the drill-down view, select any metric value for the agent you're interested in, and then select **Details**. Use the **Back** button to come back to the main view from a details view. The **Details** button and **Hourly** button are in disabled mode by default and get enabled only when a metric is selected.

## Drill down view of agent hourly details

The Agent hourly details drill-down view provides granular insight into the hour-by-hour breakdown of key conversation metrics within the contact center. The metrics for Session summary, Session details, Consult/Monitor, and Availability are the same as in the day-by-day view, ensuring that supervisors can consistently analyze their contact center operation regardless of duration granularity. 
To view the drill-down view, select any single metric value on the required day, then select **Hourly details**.

## Drill down view of agent presence statuses

The agent presence status drill-down view shows the start time and end time of all the presence statuses for agents during their work hours. This data helps you derive the duration of each presence status for the agent.

Select the **Availability** tab. In **Aggregated view**, the duration of the presence status is displayed for each hour. In **Detailed view**, the start and end times of the presence status are displayed for each agent, over a month.

## Drill down view of agent custom presence

The agent custom presence drill-down view provides insight into the out-of-the-box presence status metrics and custom presence metrics.

Select the **Availability** tab and then select **Aggregated view** to view the hourly details of the various statuses. The **Presence status** column shows metrics for both out-of-the-box and custom-state metrics. For example, on April 5, 2022, the specific agent spent 0.7h in the custom state of **Training** and 0.6h in the out-of-the-box status of **Busy - DND**.
