# Convert cases into knowledge articles

At times, existing knowledge articles don't contain relevant information for resolving a case. You, as a customer service representative (service representative or representative), can now contribute to the knowledge base by turning all information that's been researched for a case into a knowledge article. You can convert one case into multiple knowledge articles.  

## Prerequisite

Make sure you have Create permissions on the Knowledge Article entity.  

## Convert a case into a knowledge article

1. In the list of active cases, open the one that has the information that you want to convert to a knowledge article.  

1. On the command bar, select the vertical ellipsis, and go to **Convert To** > **To Knowledge Article**.  

   The **Convert to Knowledge Article** dialog box opens. The title, owner, and subject of the article are populated based on the title, owner, and subject of the case. The content of the article is automatically populated with the description of the case. If the case is resolved, the content field shows the case description, case resolution, and case resolution description.  

1. If you want to open the newly-created article, select the **Open the new knowledge article** field to set it to **Yes**, and then select **Convert**. Otherwise, set it to **No**.  

1. If you set **Open the new knowledge article** to **Yes**, a knowledge article form opens. Fill in the necessary information for the knowledge article, and then select the **Save** button. More information: [Create and manage knowledge articles](customer-service-hub-user-guide-knowledge-article.md#create-and-manage-knowledge-articles)

The knowledge article is created regardless of whether you set **Open the new knowledge article** to **Yes** or **No**.
