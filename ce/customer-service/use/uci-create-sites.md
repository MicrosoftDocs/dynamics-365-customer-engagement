# Use sites to manage your service locations

## Introduction

Create sites to define the locations where you provide service to your customers. When youâ€™re scheduling resources, you can define which resources will work on which site.

You can also create a site in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) 9.1 also. More information: [New features in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises)](/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/whats-new#support-for-site-entity-in-unified-interface)
