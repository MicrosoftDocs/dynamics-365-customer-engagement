# Summary dashboard

The Summary dashboard gives you a broad overview of the customer service experience in your organization. It uses AI to provide insights into topics that generate the highest volume and topics that are emerging with the highest rate of change in volume.

The summary dashboard includes various charts with graphical views of key performance indicators (KPIs) in Customer Service.

:::image type="content" source="../media/cs-summary-dashboard.png" alt-text="Summary dashboard for Customer Service historical analytics":::

The case volume drivers and emerging case volume by topic charts use natural language understanding to group support cases as topics that are a collection of related cases. These charts show you the customer support topics generate the most volume and emerging topics with the highest rate of change in volume. This helps you identify areas of improvement that can affect support performance.

By default, the dashboard shows you KPIs for the past month and for all channels, queues, and agents in your system. The data filtering options allow you to select data for a specific time period, channel, queue, and agent. To filter data by duration, channel, queue, or agent, select a value from the respective dropdown list. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you switch to a different dashboard, the filter you specify persists and is applied to the data on all dashboards.
