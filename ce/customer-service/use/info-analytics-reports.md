## Reports refresh, data retention

The reports refresh shows the following information.

- **Data refresh:** Occurs every 24 hours. The reports are available during the refresh process. The **Last updated** timestamp in the report pages indicates when the latest data was included in the report, and the time reflects the time zone that's set in your user preferences.
- **Custom refresh:** Isn't available.
- **Data refresh for inactive environments:** Data refresh is paused for organizations that aren't in use for 30 days. After the next 30 days of inactivity, the analytics feature is deprovisioned on the organization.
- **Data retention:** Data is stored for 24 months.
