The reports refresh shows the following information.

- **Custom refresh:** Isn't available.
- **Data refresh for inactive environments:** Data refresh is paused for organizations that aren't in use for 30 days. After the next 30 days of inactivity, the analytics feature is deprovisioned on the organization.
