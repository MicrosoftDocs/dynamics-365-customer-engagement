# View AI-suggested similar cases and knowledge articles

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]

When you open an active case, you can view suggestions about knowledge articles  and similar cases that were previously resolved successfully. With the use of AI, these features help you find the right solutions and provide better and faster service to customers. To understand how AI-suggestions work, see [How AI suggestions for similar cases and knowledge articles work](../administer/csw-enable-ai-suggested-cases-knowledge-articles.md#how-ai-suggestions-for-similar-cases-and-knowledge-articles-work).

The AI suggestions are displayed in smart assist, an intelligent assistant that provides real-time recommendations to you, helping you take actions on active cases or during your interactions with customers in ongoing conversations. If similar cases and knowledge articles aren't displayed, your Administrator would've disabled the AI-suggestions for similar cases and knowledge articles features.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Smart assist** pane is displayed only when you open the case in a new session tab. If you open to view a resolved case in an app tab when your in-progress case is open, smart assist isn't refreshed for the resolved case.

## Prerequisites

- AI-suggestions for similar cases and knowledge articles should be enabled. This feature is enabled out of the box.
- Smart assist feature must be enabled by your administrator. More information: [Smart assist in Customer Service Workspace](csw-productivity-pane.md#smart-assist)
- The Productivity tools user role must be assigned to you.

## Understand the knowledge article components in smart assist

When you open an active case to work on it, up to three top knowledge articles that match the case context are displayed in the **Smart assist** pane.

The following table lists the explanation of the smart assist card for AI-suggested knowledge articles.

| Label | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Displays the information about the cards when selected.|
| 2 | Title of the related knowledge article. |
| 3 | More commands|
| 4 | Displays the actions that can be performed when you select more commands.|
| 5 | A brief summary of the knowledge article that is generated by the AI model. |
| 6 | Option to link the article with the case as a related article. |
| 7 | Displays the confidence score based on which the knowledge article was selected by the AI model. Usually, the suggested knowledge articles are highly relevant to the context of conversations when the confidence score is above 80%; suggestions with lower confidence score may still be relevant based on the semantic meaning of some key words in the conversation. The minimum confidence score is 65%. |
| 8 | When user selects **Yes**, the label is highlighted and the card remains on the pane. If user selects **No**, the card is replaced with a new suggestion, if it exists. This feedback from customer service representatives (service representatives or representatives) is used by the AI model to retrain and improve the suggestions over time.|
| 9 |Displays information on the keywords that were used by the AI model to match the article. |

If no knowledge articles match, then the card displays an appropriate message, such as "No suggestions found for knowledge article."

## Understand the similar cases components in smart assist

When you open an active case to work on it, up to top three resolved cases that you have access to are suggested by the AI model and displayed in the **Smart assist** pane. By default, the suggestions are made based on case title and description. Your administrator may change the settings to use other text fields for the AI model to get the case context.

| 4 |  Blue bar indicates that the user hasn't interacted with the card yet. |
