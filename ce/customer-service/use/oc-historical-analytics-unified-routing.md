## Unified routing report in Omnichannel historical analytics

The Unified routing report provides routing-specific KPIs and metrics that can be used by supervisors and administrators to track the success of their routing strategy. They can also track the incorrectly routed work items and configurations and correct them to improve the routing effectiveness and thereby customer satisfaction.

The report appears as a tab in the Omnichannel historical analytics report if your administrator has enabled the corresponding setting on the **Insights** page in the Customer Service admin center app.

The report can be filtered on the following:

- **Duration**: Filters the data by the selected value of day, week, or month.
- **Channel**: Filters the data for the selected channel.
- **Queue**: Filters the data for the selected queue.
- **Conversation status**: Filters the data for the selected status.
- **Time zone**: Filters the data for the selected time zone.

The unified routing report displays the following metrics for the selected filters. The percentage value for each KPI denotes the comparative data with the previous period.
