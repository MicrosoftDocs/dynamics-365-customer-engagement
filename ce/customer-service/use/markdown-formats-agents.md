# Markdown formats for agents

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]


You can use Markdown to format messages when you interact with customers over chat and social channels.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use Markdown in chat and social channels only if your administrator has enabled the Markdown settings under **Agent experience** in the Customer Service admin center or Contact Center admin center app. More information: [Enable formatted messages](../administer/enable-formatted-messages.md)

## Markdown formats for chat messages

The following table lists the Markdown formats that you can use for your chat messages in the application. 

|  Text style               |    You type...                       | The text displays as...  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------      | -----------------------  |
| bold                      | \*\*bold text\*\*   or \*bold text*                          | **bold text**                 |
| italics                   | \_italic text\_                          | *italic text*                   |

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, we don't support the **<Shift + Enter>** key combination to add multiple line breaks.

> [!NOTE]
> If you copy and paste formatted content from an external source, it might not persist in the chat. The input text that the agent sends must be in Markdown for the output to be rendered as required.

Formatted messages are supported in channels such as Microsoft Teams, WhatsApp, Facebook, Telegram, and custom channels that use Direct Line.
