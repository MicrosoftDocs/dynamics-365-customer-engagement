# Create and manage knowledge articles

[!INCLUDE[cc-trial-sign-up](../../includes/cc-trial-sign-up.md)]

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]


Turn your customer questions, issues, and feedback into knowledge articles, so that customer service representatives (representatives) can benefit from them. Add images and videos to your articles to explain things better and make the articles engaging. You can author, edit, search, publish, and translate the knowledge articles in the Customer Service Hub, Customer Service workspace or Contact Center workspace.

Knowledge articles can address any number of issues your customers encounter while using your organization's product or services. Types of knowledge articles can include solutions to common issues, product or feature documentation, answers to frequently asked questions (FAQ), product briefs, and more.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Knowledge management is available out of the box through the Customer Service Hub app module, and it works with other customer service apps as well. Articles that are created in the Customer Service Hub are available in the Dynamics 365 Customer Service app as read-only records.  

> [!NOTE]
> The entities `KBArticle`, `KBArticleTemplate` and `KBArticleComment` are now deprecated. This means we don't expect you to use these entities anymore. You must use the newer `KnowledgeArticle` entity for knowledge management in Dynamics 365 Customer Service. Learn more in [Work with knowledge articles](../administer/work-knowledge-articles.md).

Make sure that you have Create and Read permissions on the Knowledge Article entity. By default, these permissions are added to the roles of knowledge manager, customer service manager, or customer service representative. Perform the following steps:
  
1. In the application site map, go to **Service** > **Knowledge Articles**.  
  
1. Select **New**.  The **New Knowledge Article** page appears.
  
1. On the **Content** tab, **Article Content** section, fill in the following details:  
  
   - **Title**: Type a descriptive title that communicates the subject and purpose of the article in a concise manner.  
  
   - **Keywords**: Type or select keywords for the article. These keywords are used to search the knowledge base for articles. Separate keywords with commas. 

   - **Description**: Type or select a short description of the article. The description appears in the search results and is used for search engine optimization.
   
       :::image type="content" source="../media/v9-add-cont_article.png" alt-text="Add article content":::
 
1. In the **CONTENT** section, add the content for your knowledge article.  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   > As soon as you click within the editor space, the rich text editor command bar appears. Use the rich text editor command bar options to format and style your content. If you can't use the features, it means that your editing space is too small. You need to resize to a larger space. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Use the rich text editor to create knowledge articles and emails](#use-the-rich-text-editor-to-create-knowledge-articles-and-emails)
  
1. Select **Save**.
   
   After the article is saved, the Business Process flow bar appears for the article. The stages are **New Process**, **Author**, **Review**, and **Publish**. The Business Process flow bar guides you to drive the article toward completeness. You can customize the stages in the Business Process flow to suit your  requirements.

1. On the Business Process flow bar, select **Author**.  

1. In the **Set Keywords** text box, add keywords for your article.
  
1. In the **Article Subject** dropdown list, choose the subject of the article to help with article searches.  
  
1. In the **Assign Primary Author** dropdown list, choose a person who is responsible for maintaining the article content. By default, the user who creates the article is the primary author.  

    Once a new article is created, the author value is replicated to Primary author if it's a system user but not a team. The knowledge article author must be a single user (not a team) in order for it to be searchable and to load properly.
    
    You can mark the article complete by selecting **Mark Complete** from the **Mark for Review** dropdown list at this stage.

> [!TIP]
> Select the icon ![Flyout icon.](../media/flyout.png) to pin the stage flyout vertically.
  
Posts about knowledge article-related activities begin to appear in the **Timeline** section.  

## Use AI-suggested article keywords and descriptions

If your administrator enabled keywords and description suggestions, you can select and enter your preferred keywords and descriptions when authoring or updating knowledge articles. Learn more in [Configure AI suggestions for article keywords and description](../administer/configure-ai-suggested-article-keywords-description.md#configure-ai-suggestions-for-article-keywords-and-description).

However, either the **Title** or **Content** fields&mdash;or any other corresponding mapped fields set by the administrator&mdash;must contain some value for suggestions to be generated. If any of the fields that the model uses to generate suggestions are empty, you see messages such as "There was a problem finding suggested keywords" or "There was a problem finding a suggested description."

1. In the article **Content** section, add the content for your knowledge article and then select **Save**. The **View suggested keywords and description** link appears.

1. Select the **View suggested keywords and description** link.

      :::image type="content" source="../media/v9-view-suggested-keywords.png" alt-text="View suggested keywords and description link":::

1. In the **Suggested keywords and description** dialog, perform the following steps:

   - Select the keywords that you want to add to your keywords list or select the **Insert all keywords** link to insert all the suggested keywords to the Keywords field. You can enter a keyword in the Keywords field to add to existing list.
   - Select **Insert suggested description** to add the description to the **Description** field.

     :::image type="content" source="../media/v9-suggested-keywords-description-dialog.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a Keyword field containing keywords that were selected from the list of suggested keywords below it.":::

1. Select **Apply Changes**.

The selected keywords and description appear in the **Keywords** and **Description** fields of the knowledge article form.

## Create knowledge articles using templates

Authors can use the templates to create knowledge articles quickly because the fields for the knowledge article are prepopulated according to the selected template. To create knowledge articles using templates:
 
Make sure that you have Create and Read permissions on the Knowledge Article entity. By default, these permissions are added to the roles of knowledge manager, customer service manager, or customer service representative.
  
1. In the application site map, go to **Service** > **Knowledge Articles**.  

    A list of available articles appear.

2.	To create an article from a template, select **+ New From Template**.
  
3.	In the **Select Knowledge Article Template** dialog, select the template to use as a base on which you author the article and select **OK**. In this example, we're selecting the template as **Getting Started With Template**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Select knowledge article template.](../media/ka-select-template.png "Select knowledge article template")
  
    You observe that some fields are prepopulated as defined in the template.

4.	In the **New Knowledge Article** page, edit the fields as required. 

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![New knowledge article page.](../media/ka-new-article-page.png "New knowledge article page")
  
5.	Select **Save**.

    The article is saved, and you can take it to the next stage to approve and publish the article to make it available for users.

> [!NOTE] 
> To learn how to create knowledge article templates, see [Create a knowledge article template](create-templates-knowledge-article.md).

## Use the rich text editor to create knowledge articles and emails

Create rich and well-formatted content for emails or knowledge articles using the new rich text editor in the application. The editor brings common word processor features like advanced styling, linking, find and replace, and insert images and tables. Learn more in [Add the rich text editor control to a model-driven app](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/rich-text-editor-control).

The **Content** editor panel consists of three tabs:

- **Designer**: Author and edit the article here. Benefit from the enhanced and rich text editing capabilities.
- **HTML**: View the HTML preview of the content here. You can author or edit the article in the HTML tab also.
- **Preview**: See how your content would look on devices like desktop, tablet, or mobile.

Additionally, you can perform **Undo**, **Redo**, and **Full Screen** in the Content editor panel. 
  
### Designer

You can choose a specific format or style for the content youâ€™re writing. The following table outlines the different formatting options of the rich text editor.

   > [!Note]
   > You can access your browser's context menu by pressing **Ctrl+right-click**. This is useful if you need to use your browser's built-in spell checker. Otherwise, you can use the right-click to provide contextual formatting for any element you might be using.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  You canâ€™t use client-side code (script tags or [!INCLUDE[pn_JavaScript](../../includes/pn-javascript.md)]) in articles or emails. If you want to associate CSS or [!INCLUDE[pn_JavaScript](../../includes/pn-javascript.md)], use web resources. 
> 
> [!NOTE]
> In mobile devices, where you have comparatively smaller screen sizes, a limited set of formatting options is displayed.

#### Use inline images

You can insert an image by directly copying and pasting it inline in the editor, dragging and dropping it from your desktop or local folder directly into the editor, or by typing a URL. 

Before using inline images, make sure that you use: 

- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, or GIF
- Supported browsers: Microsoft Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Safari

**Drag and drop an image**

> [!Note]
> You can only drag and drop an image in an editable area of the editor.

1. Drag and drop the image either above the content or in the middle of the content in the editor.

2. Drag any corner of the image to resize it to your desired size in the editor.

**Copy and paste an image**

> [!Note]
> To copy and paste images, you must open the image file and then copy and paste it into the editor. <br>You can drag and drop or copy and paste an image from Microsoft Word into the editor. One or two images can be copied at a time, as long as the total size of the images together doesn't exceed 5 MB.

1. Open the image file that you want to copy to the editor.

2. Right-click the image, then select **Copy**.

3. Go to the desired location in the editor where you want to insert the image, and then either right-click and select **Paste**, or select **Ctrl+V**.

**Insert a URL for an image**

To insert an image by using a URL or navigating to the local image:

1. In the editor, choose **Insert Image**.
2. In the **Image** property dialog, choose from the following options:
   - Specify the web address of the image, and also specify properties to define how the image appears in the email or article.
    
     **Note:** If the image is located on the external server, use the full absolute path. If the image is located on a local server, you can use a relative path. If you want the image to be a selectable link, add a URL for the image. You can also specify if you want the targeted page to open in a new window, top-most window, same window, or parent window.

   - Select **Browse** to navigate to the image on your computer.

### HTML

You can author and edit the article in the HTML tab of the Content editor panel, using HTML tags.

![HTML panel.](../media/html-panel.PNG "HTML pane in content editor for knowledge article")


### Preview

You can preview the content to view its compatibility on multiple devices, like tablets or phones.

![Preview panel.](../media/preview-panel.png "Preview pane in content editor for knowledge article")

This preview is an indicative preview. Content rendered can be different in the actual device or screen.

> [!NOTE]
> If you add anchor links to a knowledge article in the **Content** field, you canâ€™t test them because they donâ€™t work in the **Designer** or **Preview** mode. The anchor links work only when you open the article in knowledge search and on portals.

## Add a file attachment to a knowledge article

When you're creating a knowledge article, you can attach one or more files to it to help provide comprehensive information for your customers. Keep in mind the following rules when attaching files:

- There's no limit to the number of articles that can be attached to a knowledge article, but the file size mustn't exceed 32 MB.
- Your administrator may limit the file size for knowledge articles.
- You must save your knowledge article before attaching files to it.

To attach a file to a knowledge article:

1. Open the knowledge article where you want to add a file attachment, and then on the **Content** tab, on the right side of the screen, select **Attach Files From**.
 
   ![Attach a file.](../media/attach-file-knowledge-article.png "Attach files to a knowledge article")

2. Choose from the following file locations:
    - **My Device** lets you browse and select files from your local device.
    - **Previous Uploads** opens a search pane where you can search and select from files that were previously uploaded to Customer Service Hub, Customer Service workspace, or Contact Center workspace.

### Work with file attachments

The **Attached files** section displays all your knowledge article attachments in a tile view horizontally above your message. The default setting for the maximum number of files that can be displayed is five attachments before the page forward functionality is displayed.

For your attached files, use the following commands:

- **Select**: Allows you to select one or more attachments by clicking the box that appears on the attachments, and then you can either **Remove** or **Download** the selected files.
- **Sort**: Allows you to sort records by a specific filter, such as file name or size.

> [!NOTE]
> Uploads and downloads of knowledge article attachments are supported for files up to 4MB only, for:
> - Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premise)
> - Customer Managed Key-enabled organizations

When you published your knowledge article, if you attached files to it, knowledge consumers can access the attachments through Knowledge Search.

#### User permissions to view and download file attachments

For users to be able to view and download file attachments, you need to grant the following permissions to the Knowledge Article table:

|Task|Access needed |  
|--------|-------------|  
| Download and search attachments | Read |
| Add attachments | Create, append, append-to |
| Remove and add existing attachments | Append or append-to |

#### Sync knowledge article attachments to the portal

To sync knowledge article attachments to the portal, your administrator must first enable the option. Learn more in [Update knowledge article attachments for portal](../administer/set-up-knowledge-management-embedded-knowledge-search.md#update-knowledge-article-attachments-for-portal).

On syncing knowledge article attachments to the portal:

- Dataverse search can search through knowledge article attachments. Learn more in [Microsoft Dataverse search can search through file data type](/power-platform-release-plan/2021wave2/data-platform/dataverse-search-search-through-file-data-type). Additionally, you must configure the faceted search results web template from your portal to be able to search through knowledge article attachments. Learn more in [Configure faceted search results web template from your portal](../develop/configure-faceted-search-results.md).
  
- There's a one-time migration from the notes attachments that have the prefix of your original KnowledgeManagement/Notesfilter setting to new attachments in knowledge articles. Only the notes attachments used in the portal are migrated to new attachments.

For more information, go to [Display file attachments with knowledge articles](/powerapps/maker/portals/customer-engagement-apps/display-file-attachments-knowledge-article).

## Mark a knowledge article for review  

To ensure that the content you create is accurate, have someone review it.  
  
You can mark an article for review or directly assign it to a specific person or queue. When you mark an article for review, it starts appearing in the knowledge managerâ€™s dashboard. The knowledge manager can then assign the article to specific team members or a queue for review.  
  
1.  In the article you want to mark for review, in the **Status Reason** dropdown list, select **Needs Review**.  
  
2.  On the Business process flow, select **Author**.  
  
3.  In the **Mark for Review** field, select **Mark Complete**.  

    ![Knowledge article review.](../media/ka-review.png)
  
4.  To assign the knowledge article to another reviewer or team, on the command bar, select **Assign** and select the user or a team.  
  
5.  To add the article to a queue so reviewers can pick it from there, on the command bar, select **Add to Queue**, and then select the queue.
