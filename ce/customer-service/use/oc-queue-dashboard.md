# Queue dashboard

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]


The Queue dashboard gives you a broad overview of the customer service experience in your organization by providing insights into how specific queues are operating.

By default, the dashboard shows key performance indicators (KPIs) for the past month and for all channels, queues, and agents in your system. You can use the data filtering options to select data for specific time periods, channels, queues, agents, conversation status, and time zone. To filter data by duration, channel, queue, agent, conversation status, or time zone, select a value from the respective dropdown list.

> [!NOTE]
> If you switch to a different dashboard, the filter you specified will persist and be applied to the data on all dashboards.
