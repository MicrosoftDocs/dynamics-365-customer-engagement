# Prevent duplicate workflows with knowledge article operations

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]


If you use [workflow processes](../../customerengagement/on-premises/customize/workflow-processes.md) to perform knowledge article operations, such as creating or updating a knowledge article, the update operation is further classified into suboperations, such as:

-	Update a knowledge article version.
-	Manage a knowledge article version.
-	Translate a knowledge article.

For the create and update operations, be aware of the following when using the workflow process: 

Whenever you create a new knowledge article manually, the system creates two articles: a root article and a base article. This means if you use a workflow process that is triggered on a create operation, the workflow is triggered twice—once each for the creation of the base article and the root article.

When you use a workflow process to perform the following update operations, the workflow is triggered twice—once each for the base article and the root article:
-	Create major version
-	Create minor version
-	Translate
  
   > [!NOTE]
   >  Other update operations, such as updating a field or approve or publish, do not trigger the second workflow.

To avoid triggering the workflow twice, in the workflow itself, set the trigger condition for the knowledge article as follows:

- For a create operation, set the root article to **Yes**.
- For an update operation, set the root article to **No**.

## Set the trigger condition
  
1. In your application, select **Settings** > **Advanced Settings**. Advanced Settings opens in a new browser tab.
  
1. In the navigation bar, select **Settings** > **Processes**.

1. Select the knowledge article flow you created. The workflow process opens in a new browser window.
  
1. In the **General** tab, select the **Add Step** dropdown list, and then select **Check Condition**. A new step will be added.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Select Check Condition.](../media/workflows-check-condition.png "Select Check Condition from the Add Step dropdown list")
  
1. In the step, select **&lt;condition&gt; (click to configure)**. The **Specify condition** page opens in a new browser window.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Select the condition to configure.](../media/workflows-configure-condition.png "Select the condition to configure")
  
1. From the entity dropdown list, select **Knowledge Article**.

1. From the field dropdown list, select **Root Article**.

1. From the condition dropdown list, select **Equals**.

1. From the value dropdown list, select a value:
    - **Yes** for the create operation.
    - **No** for the update operation.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Set workflow condition.](../media/workflows-set-condition.png "Select the applicable value for the workflow condition from the dropdown list")

1. Select **Save and Close** to save the condition and close the window.

1. In the workflow process window, select **Save and Close** to save the condition and close the window.

Now, when you perform a create or update operation, the workflow process will trigger only once.
