# Understand how Copilot supports different languages

Copilot generates responses to agent's questions and supports case and conversation summary features in [multiple languages](../administer/cs-region-availability-service-limits.md#language-support-for-ai-based-analytics-and-insights-in-customer-service).

The key features are as follows:

- Copilot detects your UI language and generates responses from cases and conversations in the language present in the UI.
- Copilot uses those knowledge articles that are tagged with the language that's same as the UI language to generate responses.
- When the input text contains mixed languages, Copilot generates responses in your UI language.
- Copilot tries to generate responses in your preferred UI language even if that isn't an officially supported language.

## Scenarios

The following scenarios can help you understand the language Copilot uses to generate the response.
