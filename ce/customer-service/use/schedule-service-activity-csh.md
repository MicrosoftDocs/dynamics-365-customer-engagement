# Schedule a service activity

Use service activity to schedule service appointments by finding the next time resources are available for a service. With the help of service activity, you can coordinate and schedule resources for a service required by your customers.
  
> [!NOTE]
> You canâ€™t create a recurring service activity. Create individual service activities as needed.

## Create a service activity
