# Use the inbox

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes](../../includes/cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Case is applicable to Customer Service only.

The inbox gives you quick view of your assigned cases, conversations, and records. It's designed to be your central place to locate, manage, and complete your day-to-day work. It can help you efficiently work on high-velocity tasks, and promote inbox sessions to regular sessions when you need more time to resolve cases and finish your conversations.

The view you see in your inbox depends on how your administrator has configured it. More information: [Configure the inbox](../administer/configure-inbox.md).

Depending on how your inbox is configured, you might see any of the following channels:

- Live chat
- Asynchronous chat
- Records
- Case
- Email
- Voice

## View the inbox

1. In Customer Service workspace or Contact Center workspace, select **Inbox** on the site map.

1. Select **Cases** or **Conversations** to view a respective list of assigned items.
   
1. Select the item to work on. It opens in a new tab. Alternatively, you can open an item in a new tab by selecting the **new session** icon.

## Filter your inbox views

You can use filters to show only the items you want in your inbox.

To filter your inbox view:

1. In the inbox, select the **Filter** icon.
