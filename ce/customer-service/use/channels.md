# Overview of channels

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes](../../includes/cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes.md)]

As new social networks and communication channels rapidly evolve, so do customer expectations on how to reach their favorite brands. Communication via many channels isn't only comfortable but expected, and businesses that seek to provide personalized services are rapidly working to enable support through the channels their customers want to use. 

Adding channels to your business support offering is a powerful way to provide personalized service to customers on the channels of their choice. It's helpful to recognize a common pattern across all channels that are enabled through the application before diving into the implementation of a single channel.

The implementation pattern for the out-of-the-box channels is as follows:

- Establish your account and respective requirements, such as a page and app, with the channel provider. These requirements ensure that you have an entry point with the channel provider through which customers engage.
- Configure the [workstream](../implement/cs-admin-center.md).
- Configure the channel in Customer Service admin center or Contact Center admin center and attach it to the workstream.
- Populate the exchange of handshake data, such as token and secrets required between the application and the channel provider. The data exchange is done in both places: the Customer Service admin center app and the channel provider experience. 

## License requirements

An active subscription of Digital Messaging Add-in is required for SMS, social channels, Microsoft Teams, and custom messaging. Learn more in [Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=866544).

You can get the Microsoft Teams channel with the following add-on license:

- [Teams license](/MicrosoftTeams/office-365-licensing)

Apart from Dynamics 365 subscriptions, if you choose to use any non-Microsoft channels, you need to acquire subscriptions from those providers as well.

The following channels are currently available in the application:
