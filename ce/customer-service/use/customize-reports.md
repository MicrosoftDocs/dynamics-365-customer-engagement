# Customize visual display

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]

Visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends for standard contact center workflows through the out-of-the-box analytics reports. You can use an embedded Power BI editor to customize the out-of-the-box reports to meet your organization's needs:

- Reveal out-of-the-box metrics that may be more relevant to your organization.
- Modify how the data is displayed; for example, change a tabular view to a graphic that displays the trend over time.
- Add new pivots and pages; for example, create a pivot or page that's dedicated to a specific queue with queue-level metrics.
- Rearrange out-of-the-box report layouts and change themes.

You can customize Customer Service historical, Omnichannel historical, and Omnichannel real-time analytics reports in the Customer Service workspace or the Contact Center workspace. You can't customize unified routing and knowledge analytics reports.

> [!NOTE]
> - After you customize and publish a report, all customizations become visible to all users in your organization.
> - You can also build new reports and new metrics using the out-of-the-box data model. Learn more in [Overview of data model customization](datamodel-overview.md).

## Prerequisites

- To edit analytics reports, users must have the **Analytics Report Author** role. Learn more in [Assign roles to users](../implement/add-users-assign-roles.md#assign-roles-to-users).

- You don't need a Power BI license to customize the Customer Service historical, Omnichannel historical, and Omnichannel real-time analytics reports embedded in the Customer Service workspace or the Contact Center workspace.

## Customize the display of analytics reports

1. In Customer Service workspace or Contact Center workspace, open the **Omnichannel real-time analytics**, **Omnichannel historical analytics**, or **Customer Service historical analytics** report.

1. Select **Edit report** to open the embedded Power BI editor.

1. Use the following panes to customize the report:

   - **Visualizations**: Select the visualizations you want in your report. You can delete a currently displayed visualization and add the one you prefer. For example, you can show **Incoming conversations over time** as a table instead of the default bar chart.

   - **Data**: Select the KPIs, measures, dimensions, and attributes you want to show in your report. The list includes all the metrics that are available for use, not just the ones that are displayed in the out-of-the-box reports. For example, you can use the **Participation Mode** metric in **FactSessionParticipant** to count the number of times a subject matter expert accepted a consult request.

1. When you're done selecting the customizations you want for your report, select **Save** and then **Publish**.

To revert all your changes to the original report settings, select **Edit report** > **Checkout default report** > **Reset**.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If you select **Reset**, any customizations that you made are permanently removed.

To continue editing the report after you publish it, select **Resume editing**.

> [!NOTE]
> Don't add more than 20 metrics or tiles to a report because it affects the report's performance. If you need more metrics, consider creating more pages and provide links to the extra pages from the existing pages.

## Understand the out-of-the-box data model

The out-of-the-box data model consists of *facts* and *dimensions*. Facts represent the data you want to analyze. Dimensions represent the attributes of the data that you want to break down to explore further.

Fact tables organize key KPIs logically. For example, **FactConversation** has conversation metrics like **Average handle time**, while **FactAgent** has **Agent metrics**.  

You can use facts and dimensions to visualize data according to your organizational requirements. If you'd like to understand how average handle time varies by queue, create a visualization like a bar chart, and divide the fact **FactConversation** > **Average Handle Time** by the dimension **DimQueue** > **Queue Name**.

### Future data model updates

If you customize your reports and then Microsoft changes the default data model for a report, the data model updates don't overwrite your customizations. However, if the naming conventions in the Power BI embedded editing experience change, those changes are reflected in the respective list. You may need to reselect the metric with the new name.
