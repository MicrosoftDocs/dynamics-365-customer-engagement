# Bot dashboard


[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]

[!INCLUDE[pva-rebrand](../../includes/cc-pva-rebrand.md)]

In the the application, you can integrate both Azure and Copilot Studio bots to perform tasks like starting a conversation with the customer, providing automated responses, and then transferring the conversation to a human agent, as required. The bot dashboard shows key performance indicators (KPIs) and charts for chat and IVR bots. You can use the dashboard to understand how bots are performing in a support organization. 

In the Customer Service workspace or Contact Center workspace application, perform the following steps to view the dashboard:

1. In the site map, select Omnichannel historical analytics.
1. On the page that appears, select the Bot dashboard.

Based on your administrator's configuration of the **Add historical analytics for bots** option in the Contact Center or Customer Service admin center, the dashboard is as follows:
- **Enabled**: Indicates that your organization only has Copilot Studio bots configured and the dashboard is specific to them. Additional metrics, charts, and KPIs that are applicable only to Copilot Studio bots are displayed.
- **Disabled**: Indicates that your organization has both Azure and Copilot Studio bots configured. The dashboard displays you metrics, KPIs, and charts that are common to both. 

## Prerequisites

- You must have the **Analytics Report Author** role to use the visual customizations in the bot dashboard. Visual customization is limited to the data available in the embedded Power BI report. If you want to add additional data, you need a Power BI license and enable data model customization.


## [Copilot Studio bot dashboard](#tab/copilotstudiodashboard)

 The bot dashboard displays metrics specific to Copilot Studio bots only if Copilot Studio bots are integrated with Omnichannel for Customer Service and the **Add historical analytics for bots** checkbox in Customer Service admin center is enabled.

  ### Report details

 The report summarizes KPIs for the specified time period and the percentage change over that period. These metrics are specific to Copilot Studio bots. You can filter these areas by duration, channel, queue, or agent.

  :::image type="content" source="../media/oc-bot-KPI.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Copilot Studio bot dashboard KPIs.":::

 | KPI | Description |
 | ------- | ------------------ |
 | Total bot conversations | The number of conversations initiated by the customer and engaged by a bot. |
 | Bot escalation rate |  The percentage of bot sessions that were escalated by a bot to a human agent or to an external phone number.  |
 | Total bot sessions |  The total number of bot sessions within the specified time period. A bot session is any conversation where a bot is invoked, whether at the beginning, during, or end. A single bot conversation can include multiple sessions, based on the number of topics the bot traverses while interacting with the customer. For example, if a customer uses a returns bot for both an exchange and a return, the system counts this as two bot sessions, even though it is one conversation.   |
 | Bot engagement rate |  The percentage of total bot sessions that are engaged sessions. An engaged bot session is a session in which a user-created topic (as opposed to a system topic) is triggered, or the session ends in an escalation. Engaged bot sessions can have one of three outcomes: they're either resolved, escalated, or abandoned. |
 | Bot resolution rate | The percentage of sessions that were closed by interacting with a bot out of all the sessions engaged by a bot. |
 | Bot abandon rate  | The percentage of engaged bot sessions that are abandoned. An abandoned session is an engaged session that isn't resolved or escalated after one hour from the beginning of the session. |
 | Bot CSAT | The graphical view of the average of customer satisfaction (CSAT) scores for bot sessions in which customers respond to an end-of-session request to take the survey. |

 The following table shows the bot KPI chart metrics.

  :::image type="content" source="../media/oc-bot-summary-charts.png" alt-text="Copilot Studio bot chart description.":::

 | --------------- | ----------------- |
 | Total conversations | A graphical view of the total number of bot conversations with the number of escalated and deflected conversations over time. |
 | Engagement over time | A graphical view of the number of engaged and unengaged bot sessions over time. An engaged session is a session in which a user-created topic is triggered or the session ends in escalation. |
 |Session outcomes over time | A graphical view of the daily resolution rate, escalation rate, and abandon rate over the specified time period. |

 ### Bot drill-down view

 In the **Metrics by bot** section, you can select a Copilot Studio bot to view the individual bot's performance on the bot drill-down view. Bot topics and their corresponding metrics are also displayed, giving supervisors further insights into individual topic performance. 

 To access the drill-down view, select the bot that you're interested in, and then select **Detailed view**.

 The application displays the key performance metrics and charts for the individual bot.

 ### Metrics by bot topic

 The **Metrics by bot topic** section provides insights into the performance of individual bot topics and their key business metrics. The metrics give the supervisor an overview of which topics the bot was able to deflect or escalate. 

 You can also select a topic and drill down into the individual topic performance and metrics. The topic-level metrics help supervisors further analyze how the bot is handling the topic. 

 > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
 > ![Screenshot of individual bot report.](../media/oc-bot-topic-report.png "Individual bot report")

 The **Bot conversation metrics** section provides the topic transcripts, allowing supervisors to go through the bot's interactions for the topic and take corrective measures.

 ### View and improve bot topics

 You can view and improve the performance of individual topics associated with a Copilot Studio bot by performing the following steps:

 1. On the bot drill-down page, for a bot, select the topic to view the topic-specific metrics. 
   You can also view and download up to seven days of bot conversation transcript sessions from the past 30 days.

   > ![Screenshot of bot transcripts.](../media/oc-transcripts.png "Bot transcript") 


 ### Customize bot dashboard

For Copilot Studio bots, you can edit the report to add the additional metrics and filters to the bot. To customize the bot dashboard, see [customize visual display](/dynamics365/contact-center/use/customize-agent-dashboard?toc=/dynamics365/customer-service/use/toc.json&bc=../../breadcrumb/toc.yml). 


## [Dashboard for all bots ](#tab/allbots)
