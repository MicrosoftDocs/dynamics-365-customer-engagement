# Use Google's Business Messages channel

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes](../../includes/cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Google's Business Messages channel will be deprecated on July 31, 2024. After this date, you won't be able to use this channel, and this article will be removed. We recommend that you use the web channel instead. For details about the deprecation and related dates, see the [Customer Service deprecation article](../implement/deprecations-customer-service.md#googles-business-messages-channel-will-be-deprecated-and-removed-in-july-2024).

When you sign in to the application, you can see your work items in the Omnichannel Agent Dashboard. To learn more, see View agent dashboard and agent conversations (work items).

## Prerequisites

Make sure your administrator has configured the Google's Business Messages channel in Omnichannel for Customer Service. More information: [Configure Google's Business Messages channel](../administer/configure-google-business-messages-channel.md)

## Incoming chat notifications

You'll receive a notification when a customer requests a conversation through Google's Business Messages. You can accept the chat request, after which a session starts and you'll see the communication panel in which you can exchange messages with the customer.
