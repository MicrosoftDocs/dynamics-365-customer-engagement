# FAQ on agent presence in Customer Service

## What happens when agent changes presence manually during a conversation?

To understand how presence works, see [How do manual and automatic presence updates work together](oc-manage-presence-status.md#how-do-manual-and-automatic-presence-updates-work-together).

## What presence does the agent have outside of working hours?

The presence status isn't calculated based on operating hours or work hour setting. For more information, see [How presence is calculated](oc-manage-presence-status.md#how-presence-is-calculated-when-agents-sign-in).

Presence status is unaffected when agent joins a consult.

## What happens to presence when agents don't close conversations properly?

Stuck conversations can result in incorrect presence status because capacity is also blocked.

Agent status remains the same when they refresh their browser.

## How is presence affected when agents experience network issues?

See [how presence status is updated](oc-manage-presence-status.md#how-presence-status-is-updated) to understand the behavior during network issues.
