[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

If you select the option to propose knowledge article for the case on the resolve case dialog, Copilot generates a knowledge draft when you select resolve.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-note-d365.md)]

## Prerequisite

Your administrator must have enabled the setting to generate knowledge drafts from cases.

## Use Copilot to generate knowledge drafts

Use the following steps to generate a knowledge draft while you are resolving a case or after you have resolved the case in Customer Service workspace.

1. In your list of active cases, select and open the case that you need to resolve.
1. On the **Resolve Case** dialog, select the **Propose new knowledge article for this case** checkbox, and then select **Resolve**. The **Propose new knowledge (preview)** dialog displays a draft with title, issue, cause, and resolution in a rich text editor.
1. To generate a knowledge draft from a resolved case, open the case and then select **Propose Knowledge Article** on the command menu.
1. While Copilot is drafting the proposal, you have the option to select **stop drafting**.
1. You can do the following actions with the draft proposal:
    - Use the editor to format the content.
    - Use **Revise with instructions** to modify and refine the proposed draft. You can propose up to five revisions.
    - Use **Create proposal** after reviewing the draft. The system saves the Copilot generated knowledge draft as a proposal.
