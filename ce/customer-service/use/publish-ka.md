# Publish knowledge articles

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]

After the content in the article is complete and reviewed, you can publish the article to the portal to make it available to your customers. You can publish the article immediately or schedule it for a later time.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your organization uses a portal to publish the knowledge articles, your customizer can write a plug-in that picks the published articles and posts on your portal, and also reports the article views.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the Publish and Update permissions on the Knowledge Article record type. These permissions are added by default to the roles of knowledge manager, customer service manager, customer service representative, or system administrator. If you want to change the state of a published article, you need the Publish permission on the Knowledge Article record type.

## Publish an article
  
1. In Customer Service Workspace or Customer Service Hub, go to **Service** > **Knowledge Articles**.  
  
1. Open a knowledge article that’s in the **Approved** state.  
  
1. To make it easy to find knowledge articles related to specific products, associate the knowledge article with a product.  
  
    1. On the command bar, select **More** > **Relate Product**.  
  
    1.  In the **Select Product to Associate with** field, select the **Lookup** button, select the product the article is about, and then select **Associate**.  
  
          The associated article appears in the **Related Products** list in the **Related Information** section of the **Summary** tab.  
  
1. On the Business process bar, select the **Publish** stage.  
  
1. In the **Set Product Associations** field, select **Mark as Complete**.  
  
1. If you want to schedule the article to publish on a later date, on the **Summary** tab, in the **Publish On** field, select a date and time to publish the article.  

1. Select **Finish**. The Publish dialog appears.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The Publish dialog appears only for the default business process flows where the final stage is **Publish**. To configure the Publish dialog for other customized stages, go to [Process events and event handler methods](/powerapps/developer/model-driven-apps/clientapi/reference/formcontext-data-process#process-events-and-event-handler-methods).

-  In the **Publish** field, select whether you want to publish the knowledge article now or in the future. To publish the article in the future, in the **Publish On** field, select a date and time.  
  
-  In the **Published Status** field, select what status the article should be in after it's published. By default, **Published** is selected.  
  
-  In the **Expiration Date** field, select a date and time when you want the published article to expire. Expired articles are no longer available in searches.  
  
-  If you’ve set an expiration date, in the **Expiration Status** field, select the status the knowledge article should be set to after it expires.  
  
-  To publish all approved related translated articles with the article, in the **Publish Approved related translations with Article** field, select **Yes**.  
  
-  Select **Publish**.

## Update published knowledge articles  

When a knowledge article is in the **Published** (or Scheduled) state, only those users who have the Publish privilege can update it.  
  
1. In the site map of Customer Service Workspace or Customer Service Hub, go to **Service** > **Knowledge Articles**.  
  
2. Select the published article you want to edit.  
  
3. On the command bar, select **Update**.  
  
4. Update the article based on the feedback.  
  
If the article has information that complements an existing knowledge article, associate the existing article with the current knowledge article.  
  
1. In the knowledge article, on the command bar, select **More** > **Relate Article**.  
  
2. In the **Select Article to Associate** field, select the **Lookup** button, select an existing article, and then select **Associate**.  
  
      The associated article appears in the **Related Articles** list in the **Related Information** section of the **Summary** tab.
