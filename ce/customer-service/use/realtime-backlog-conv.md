# View and understand the Backlog conversation report in Omnichannel real-time analytics

The Backlog conversation report lists all open, active, and waiting conversations that were created in the last 30 days. It allows you to view persistent chats that are longer than 24 hrs. Learn how to [access the report](intro-realtime-analytics-dashboard.md#access-reports).

## Key metrics

You can view **Modified On** time that reflects the most recent activity in ongoing conversations, and not just most recent created ones. Use the **Conversation mode** filter to sort **Live Chat** and **Persistent Chat**.

You can extend the default timeframe of 30 days as required. To avoid performance issues, we recommend that you don't extend the default timeframe.

As supervisors, you can assign, transfer, monitor, and force close extended conversations.
