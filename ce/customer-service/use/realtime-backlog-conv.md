# View and understand the Backlog conversation report in Omnichannel real-time analytics

The Backlog conversation report lists all open, active, and waiting conversations that were created in the last 30 days. It allows you to view persistent chats that are longer than 24 hrs.

## Prerequisites

You'll need to contact Microsoft Support to enable this feature.

## Key metrics

You can view **Modified On** time that reflects the most recent activity in ongoing conversations, and not just most recent created ones. Use the **Conversation mode** filter to sort **Live Chat** and **Persistent Chat**.

You can extend the default timeframe of 30 days as required. We recommend that you don't extend the default timeframe to avoid performance issues.

As supervisors, you can assign, transfer, monitor, and force close extended conversations.
