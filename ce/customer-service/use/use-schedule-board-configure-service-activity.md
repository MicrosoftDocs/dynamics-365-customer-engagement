# Use the schedule board to configure service activities

This article explains the actions you can take to configure the schedule board in your environment. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the new schedule board in Dynamics 365, showing the resources and requirements.](../media/Schedule-Board-New-Overview-01.png)


The schedule board is designed to lay the foundation for new capabilities for multi-day scheduling and intelligent interactions.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the new schedule board in Dynamics 365, showing the resources.](../media/schedule-board-new.png)


### Performance

The schedule board is designed for fast response e when you do the following tasks: 

- Load the schedule board
- Select schedule board tabs
- Reschedule bookings

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the new schedule board.](../media/schedule-board-new-accessability.png "View of new schedule board")

### Usability and accessibility

The schedule board is a Power Apps Component Framework (PCF) control built on the Unified Client Interface, making it more flexible, supportable, and accessible. The new schedule board works better on different screen sizes and across form factors. 

Current color schemes and ways of depicting travel time help make it easier for schedulers to see statuses and details.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of an outlined "ghost booking" to preview a schedule on the schedule board.](../media/schedule-board-new-drag.png "View of outlined booking to preview schedule")

For example, the preceding screenshot shows a "ghost booking" feature that helps schedulers know if a booking fits into a schedule before the booking is even scheduled.

### Foundation for new capabilities

The schedule board provides the foundation for future releases to help provide schedulers with insights and recommendations for how to improve schedules.

## Prerequisites

The next generation schedule board is generally available and requires that you have Dynamics 365 Customer Service.
 

## Enable new schedule board

To switch between the former and current schedule boards, go to the schedule board and use the toggle button on the top-right side. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the schedule board showing the preview toggle in the top right set to "On.".](../media/schedule-board-new-enable-preview.png "Preview toggle on the schedule board")

## Select and filter resources

Choose which resources should display on each schedule board tab.

1. Expand the filter pane, and then choose **Select Resources**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the schedule board, showing resources.](../media/schedule-board-new-select-resources1.png "Schedule board resources view")

2. From the list of available resources on the left, move the ones you want to display on the schedule board to the right, and then select **Apply**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the resources dialog on the schedule board in Customer Service.](../media/schedule-board-new-select-resources2.png "Resources dialog view")

## Resource cards

Right-click a resource's name and then choose **View Resource Card** to see more, like the resource's skill set (characteristics) and roles. From here, you can also initiate a message, email, or phone call.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of a resource card on the Customer Service schedule board.](../media/schedule-board-new-resource-card.png "Resource card view on schedule board")

## Map view of requirements and resources

To display the resources and requirements on a map, select the map icon on the upper-right side of the schedule board.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the schedule board with map view.](../media/Schedule-Board-New-Map-02.png "Map view on schedule board")

After expanding the map view, select a resource's name to see their route. The numbers indicate the order the resource is scheduled to arrive at each job (requirement) location.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the schedule board showing the technician route.](../media/Schedule-Board-New-Map-Technician-route-03.png "View of technician route")
 
On a zoomed-out view of the map, the requirements and resources are grouped together, and you can see a count of requirements and resources. This count helps you quickly identify a geographical area with more unscheduled jobs, and then start scheduling the jobs to nearest resources. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the schedule board with the grouping of the requirement pins.](../media/Schedule-Board-New-Map-requirement-pin-cluster-04.png "View of grouping of requirement pins")

You can drag an unscheduled requirement pin from the map to the resource timeline and schedule it to that resource. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the schedule board, showing how to drag the requirement pin.](../media/Schedule-Board-New-Map-requirement-pin-drag-05.png "View of how to drag requirement pin")

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the schedule board, showing the dropping of the requirement pin.](../media/Schedule-Board-New-Map-requirement-pin-drop-06.png "View of dropping requirement pin on schedule board")

You can also drag the resource route to a nearby unscheduled requirement to schedule it and add it to the resource route. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the schedule board showing dragging of the resource route.](../media/Schedule-Board-New-Map-tech-route-drag-07.png "View of dragging of resource route on board")

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the schedule board showing dropping of the resource route.](../media/Schedule-Board-New-Map-tech-route-drop-08.png "View of dropping of the resource route")

## Daily view

The schedule board supports a daily view of scheduled jobs, and supports dragging-and-dropping to the schedule.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the daily schedule view on the new schedule board.](../media/scheduling-new-daily-view-schedule1.png "View of daily schedule on board")

Scheduled requirements with a short duration display across the entire day to make it easier to view details. Hover over the requirement or double-click it to see the actual duration. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the new schedule board showing another daily view detail.](../media/scheduling-new-daily-view.png "View of daily view details")

## Weekly and monthly views

Switch to the weekly or monthly views to see scheduled jobs at a higher level. To trigger the booking panel, select a resource's time slot and a requirement.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the weekly view on the new Customer Service schedule board.](../media/schedule-board-new-weekly.png "Weekly view of new schedule board")

The booking panel helps you schedule a service activity across multiple days and choose how the work should be divided each day.

## Schedule resources

Beyond manual drag-and-drop scheduling, organizations that use resource scheduling optimization can select one or more requirements from the schedule board and either have the system **Suggest resources** or **Book resources**. This feature is currently in Preview for the organizations that are using Resource Scheduling Optimization.


> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the suggest resources option.](../media/scheduling-new-suggest-resources.png "View of suggest resources option")

Select **Suggest resources** to display recommended resources in the right panel for the scheduler to book.


> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the scheduling assistance preview.](../media/schedule-board-new-rso.png "View of scheduling assistance preview")

Select **Book resources** to find the most optimal resources and book them without requiring further actions from the scheduler.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the scheduling assistant preview showing suggestions.](../media/schedule-board-new-rso-suggest.png "View of scheduling assistant showing suggestions")

**Suggest resources** and **Book resource** capabilities on the new schedule board are currently only available for organizations using resource scheduling optimization.

Sometimes you might need to optimize only a single resource's schedule rather than a set of available resources. Single resource optimization provides a quick way to reoptimize a resource's schedule and travel route after schedule changes occur during the day. This functionality is available on the schedule board: Right-click a resource from any schedule board view, and then select **Optimize Schedule**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the optimize schedule for a resource.](../media/schedule-board-optimizer.png "View of optimized schedule for a resource")

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the optimize schedule for a resource in progress.](../media/schedule-board-optimizer-progress.png "View of optimized schedule progress for a resource")
> 
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the optimize schedule results.](../media/schedule-board-optimizer-results.png "View of optimized schedule results")

## Move bookings to a new resource, a new start date and time, or both

In Customer Service, the new schedule board provides an easy way to reassign and reschedule bookings in the same action. You can move bookings to resources on the current schedule board tab, or to resources on other schedule board tabs.

### Move a booking to a resource on the current schedule board tab, or change the start date/time, or both

1. Right-click a booking, and then select **Move to**. 
2. Reassign the booking to any resource on the current schedule board tab, or change the start date and the start time of the booking. 
3. Select **Update** to apply the changes.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the move to option.](../media/moveto-popup.png "View of move to option")

### Move a booking to a resource on a different schedule board tab, or change the start date or time, or both

1. Right-click the booking, and then select **Move to**.
2. Select the filter icon in the resource field, and then change the filter from **Resources on this tab** to **All resources**.
   Now, you can reassign this booking to any resource on any tab, and change the start date and start time of the booking.
3. Select **Update** to apply the changes.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the move to with resource filter expanded option.](../media/moveto-popup-filterexpanded.png "View of move to resource filter expanded option")

## Automatic scheduling with optimization goals

The schedule board supports optimization goals. After schedulers select suggested resources, they can edit the optimization goal, which dictates how resources are recommended. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the schedule assistant showing optimization goals on the schedule board.](../media/schedule-board-new-optimization-goals-edit.png "View of schedule assistant showing optimization goals on schedule board")

There's a default optimization goal that applies to the entire system and serves as the default for optimization requests. Schedulers can also edit the default optimization goal for each schedule board. Finally, schedulers can edit the optimization goal for a single optimization request by selecting **Suggest Resources**. 

## Edit multi-day bookings

After you create a multi-day booking across multiple days, weeks, or months, you can right-click the booking, select **Edit**, and then change how many hours are assigned for each day, week, or month via the booking panel on the right. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of a multi-day booking on the schedule board.](../media/schedule-board-new-edit-multiday-bookings.png "View of schedule board multi-day booking")

## Use the appointments feature in resource scheduling

Organizations often use appointments in Dynamics 365. For example, an agent might create a service appointment to help a customer with an issue. Other examples include organizations that create appointments because of integrations with other systems.

You can display Dynamics 365 Appointments (Microsoft Dataverse appointments) on the Customer Service schedule board alongside bookings, and configure them to be considered during scheduling to better understand whether an agent or bookable resource is available.

For information on how to configure and use appointment scheduling, see [Include appointments in scheduling](/dynamics365/field-service/appointment-scheduling).

## Configuration considerations

- The new schedule board is currently supported on Microsoft Edge, Chrome, and Firefox browsers.

### When to use the new versus current schedule board

The schedule board is recommended for manual scheduling scenarios and for organizations that want to get up and running with a scheduling solution for schedulers. The schedule board is designed and built to deliver improved performance and usability. Organizations that use resource scheduling optimization should consider using the schedule board because the resource scheduling optimization capabilities are embedded.

The in-market schedule board is recommended for complex scheduling scenarios, like assisted scheduling, multi-resource scheduling, using requirement groups, and so on. 

Use the following feature comparison table to understand which version of the schedule board is right for your business.

### Add new schedule board to custom sitemap area

When using a custom sitemap or an app module, you need to update the sitemap to consume the new schedule board preview.

The following snippet is what it looks like before:

```<SubArea Id="msdyn_ScheduleBoardSubArea" ResourceId="SitemapDesigner.NewSubArea" VectorIcon="$webresource:msdyn_/Icons/SVG/Calendar.svg" Url="$webresource:msdyn_/fps/ScheduleBoard/ScheduleBoard.html" Client="All,Outlook,OutlookLaptopClient,OutlookWorkstationClient,Web" AvailableOffline="true" PassParams="false" Sku="All,OnPremise,Live,SPLA">```

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the sitemap before.](../media/schedule-board-new-sitemap-before.png "View of new sitemap before update")

The following snippet is what it looks like after:

```<SubArea Id="msdyn_ScheduleBoardSubArea" ResourceId="SitemapDesigner.NewSubArea" VectorIcon="$webresource:msdyn_/Icons/SVG/Calendar.svg" Url="/main.aspx?pagetype=entitylist&amp;etn=msdyn_scheduleboardsetting" Client="All,Outlook,OutlookLaptopClient,OutlookWorkstationClient,Web" AvailableOffline="true" PassParams="false" Sku="All,OnPremise,Live,SPLA">```
​

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the sitemap after.](../media/schedule-board-new-sitemap-after.png "View of sitemap after update")

**URL:**

```/main.aspx?pagetype=entitylist&etn=msdyn_scheduleboardsetting```

**ID:**

```msdyn_scheduleboardtoggle```

## Other notes

- The schedule board is only supported in Unified Interface web, and not on tablets or phones.
- The booking status colors that appear on the schedule board have lower opacity than the defined booking status colors. This behavior is similar to the Outlook calendar. When a booking is selected on the schedule board, the booking color appears with normal opacity.

### Uninstall the schedule board

To uninstall the schedule board solution ("Resource Scheduling Controls"), perform the following steps.

1. Go to the **Schedule Board Settings** entity customization form.
2. Remove the new schedule board preview control from the grid.
3. Save and publish the changes.
4. Go to the resource scheduling app, clear the browser's cache, and reload schedule board. The old schedule board loads without the toggle in the top-right side of the screen.
5. Once the solution is uninstalled, the new schedule board isn't available for the environment until you upgrade your Customer Service app to the latest available version.
