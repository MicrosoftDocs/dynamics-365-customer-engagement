# Report filters and groups

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]


 Historical analytics reports are grouped into the following categories.

Omnichannel historical analytics reports:

- **Summary** and **Bot** tabs
- **Conversation**, **Queue**, and **Agent** tabs
- **Topics** tab
- **Voice** tab
- **Unified routing** tab

Customer Service historical analytics reports:

- **Summary**, **Agent**, and **Topics** tabs

Knowledge analytics reports:

- **Search Term Insights** tab
- **Article Insights** tab

When you set one or more filters on a report, the filters are applied to the entire report group. Say, for example, that you've set the "channel" filter to display records related to the live chat channel in the **Conversation** tab of the Omnichannel historical report. This filter is automatically applied to other tabs of the report group&mdash;**Queue** and **Agent**&mdash;but not to the **Bot**, **Summary**, **Topics**, **Voice**, or **Unified routing** tabs.
