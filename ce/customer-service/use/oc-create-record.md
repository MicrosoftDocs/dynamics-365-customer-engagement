# Create a record for conversations



[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]

When no records are linked to the conversation, you can create a record. You can create a record in one of the following ways:

- Create a record from the **Active Conversation** page
- Create a record using the **Quick Create** option
- Create a record using the **New** option

## Create a record from the Active Conversation page

In the **Active Conversation** page and on the customer and case forms, you'll see an option to create a new record. When you select the **New** option, a corresponding form opens in a new tab. You can fill in the details and save the record, and the record is auto-linked to the conversation.

Depending on your administrator's settings, you'll see the enhanced **Active Conversation** or the default **Active Conversation** page.

To create a record from the **Active Conversation** page:

1. Select an option in the Customer or Case section based on the record you want to create. After you select the option, a form opens in an application tab panel.
    
    | Option | Section | Description |
    |---------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
    | New Account | Customer | Select this option to create a new account record |
    | New Contact | Customer | Select this option to create a new contact record |
    | New Case | Case | Select this option to create a new case record |

2. Specify the details in the form fields.

3. Select **Save**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Fill in the form.](../media/customer-summary-create-new-contact.PNG "Fill in the form")

After you save, the record is automatically linked to the conversation. When you switch to the **Active Conversation** page, you can view the auto-linked record.

If you create the account or contact first and then start to create a case record, the case form shows the linked customer name in the **Customer** field.

   > ![Case form automatically links the customer who is already linked to conversation.](../media/customer-summary-create-case-customer-linked.png "Case forms shows the customer")

## Create a record using the Quick Create option

Use the quick create (**+**) option in the nav bar to create a record. After creating the record, you must manually search and link the record to the conversation.

To create a record

1.  Select the **+** icon to create a record.

2.  Select a record type from the list: <br>
 - Case
 - Contact
 - Account
 
> [!Note]
> Case information is applicable to Customer Service only.


   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
   > ![Create record quickly.](../media/oc-oceh-create-quick-create.png "Create record quickly")

3. In the left pane, you can see a new record page. Specify the details in the form.

4. Select **Save and Close** to save the changes and close the form.


 > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
 > ![Quick create contact.](../media/oc-oceh-quick-create-contact.png "Quick create contact")

After you save the changes, you can link the record to the conversation. To learn more, see [Search and link a record to the conversation](oc-search-link-unlink-record.md#search-for-records-by-using-the-inline-search-option) 

## Create a record using the New option

> [!Note]

In the **Active Conversation** page, when you are trying to search a record in customer or case section, after you type few characters to search, you can use the inline **New** button to create a record. After you select the button, the **Quick Create** pane of the record appears.

1. Type to search in the search box. The records appear as a list that matches your search criteria.

2. Select **New** below the list of records. The **Quick Create** pane appears.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Quick create record.](../media/customer-summary-search-section-create-case.png "Quick create record")

3. Fill in the form and select **Save and Close**. The **Quick Create** pane closes and the **Active Conversation** page refreshes. The record you created is auto-linked in the customer or case section.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Auto-link record.](../media/customer-summary-search-section-auto-link-case.png "Auto-link record")
