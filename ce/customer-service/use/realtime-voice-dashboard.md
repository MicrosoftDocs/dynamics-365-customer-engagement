# View and understand the Voice report in Omnichannel real-time analytics

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]



The **Voice** report gives you insights into key metrics across the voice channel. You can filter this report by time, queue, time zone, conversation status, direction, and skills. For more information, go to [Overview of the real-time Omnichannel analytics dashboard](intro-realtime-analytics-dashboard.md).

This report is available only if the voice feature is configured for your organization. For more information, go to [Manage real-time analytics reports ](../administer/enable-realtime-analytics-dashboard-administrator.md#manage-real-time-analytics-reports-in-omnichannel-for-customer-service).

The **Voice** report provides a summary of voice conversations over time, by queue. Voice-specific metrics for the last 24 hours, such as conversations in the queue, average wait time, and average handle time, help you optimize the call flow. You can use these metrics to reduce the conversation hold time. You can assign the right agents based on skills and increase agent efficiency and customer satisfaction.

You can also monitor voice-specific operational metrics such as conversation direction. This metric indicates whether the conversation was started by the customer or a contact center agent. You can use these operational metrics to manage queue distribution.

## Interactive charts

You can view different types of charts on the report, such as bar, horizontal bar, and donut charts. The visual display helps you discern changes and patterns in the data, so that you can act quickly to address the most important issues.

When you select a component in a chart, the data is filtered accordingly. In this way, you can view only data that is related to the selected component. For example, if you select the **Busy** component in the **Agent availability status** chart, the dashboard is refreshed and shows only the agents who are currently in the **Busy** state.

## Drill-down report

Drill down to sections of a report to find the data that interests you the most. To view voice conversation analytics, select the **Show more** link on the **Voice conversations over time** KPI. You can drill through voice conversations analytics and analyze data by queue.
