# Sign up for a free trial

Dynamics 365 Customer Service offers a 30-day free trial. After a quick sign up, you will have access to many of the app's key features. The trial allows you to test the app, load sample data, and even try out your own customer data. [Learn more about what Customer Service has to offer](/dynamics365/customer-service/overview)

## Experience for a trial user

Customer Service uses a Microsoft Dataverse environment to store and manage data. Provisioning an environment typically takes 15 to 60 minutes to complete. While an environment is getting provisioned, some functionalities aren't available, but you can perform minimal operations and explore the product. After the environment is provisioned, all functionalities become available. More information: [What is Dataverse](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro) and [Environments overview](/power-platform/admin/environments-overview)

This section lists all the functionality that will be restricted until an environment is provisioned. These restrictions apply to only for:

- The default environment.
- The trial users and the users who purchase Customer Service through Microsoft 365 admin center.

### What you can do while an environment is being provisioned?

- Try the demo chat experience as an agent and customer that is available on the home page.
- [Understand how agents manage their cases and work on them](csw-overview.md).

### What you can't do while an environment is being provisioned?

Configure and use social, SMS, or the Microsoft Teams channels in Omnichannel for Customer Service.
