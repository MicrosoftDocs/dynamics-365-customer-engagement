# Restrict a resource from performing a service (Customer Service)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

You can restrict a resource from performing a service and define the service capacity for the resource. You can also restrict when a resource is available to be scheduled for a specific service. The resource is still available for scheduling service activities for other services.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Service scheduling has been deprecated. For more information, see [Important changes coming](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/get-started/whats-new/customer-engagement/important-changes-coming).

    - **This date only**  
  
         This option changes only the date selected.  
  
         If you select this option, skip to step 8.  
  
    - **From \<this date> onward**  
  
         This option only changes the schedule going forward.  
  
    - **Entire recurring weekly schedule from start to end**  
  
         This option changes the entire schedule from the start to end date.  
  
         Selecting this option might change past days, which may affect reports regarding hours worked in the past.  
  
7. In the **Weekly Schedule** dialog box, click the work hours link for the schedule you want to modify.  
  
8. In the **Work Day** dialog box, click the **Service Restrictions** tab.
