# Case queues and routing
Customer Service Hub provides you with the ability to add a case to a queue, and save case records and route them to a queue.

## Add a case to a queue  
 If you think another group in your team has expertise on the subject, you can move the case to a queue so that someone else can pick it up.  

1. [!INCLUDE[proc_service_cases](../includes/proc-service-cases.md)]  

2. In the list of cases, select the case that you want to add to a queue.  

3. On the command bar, select **Add to Queue**.  

4. In the **Queue** field, select the queue that you want to add the case to, and then select **Add**.  

To know more about Queues, see [Work with Queues](work-with-queues.md).

## Save and route a case  
 To save a case record and route it to a queue in a single select, use the **Save & Route** button.  

1.  From the list of cases, open a case record.  

2.  Make the changes as required, and on the command bar, select **Save & Route**.  

3.  In the **Route Case** dialog box, select **Route**.  

     The case will be routed based on the active routing rule set.  

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >  The **Save & Route** button is available only on active cases.
