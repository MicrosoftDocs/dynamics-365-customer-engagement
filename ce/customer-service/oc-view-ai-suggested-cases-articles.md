# View smart assist suggestions for knowledge articles and similar cases using AI

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)] 

## Introduction

The AI suggestions are displayed in smart assist, which is an intelligent assistant that provides real-time recommendations to you, helping you take actions during your interactions with customers.

The AI-suggestions for similar cases and knowledge articles are powered by a set of pre-trained natural language understanding models that help you find relevant knowledge articles or similar cases quickly, based on the context of ongoing conversations that you are handling. Your administrator can enable AI-suggested similar cases and knowledge articles through a single click. These suggestions are displayed in real time based on the conversation context.

If the productivity pane has been enabled for you, then the smart assist cards appear on the productivity pane when you are interacting with a customer in an ongoing conversation. By default, the productivity pane is enabled out of the box.

## Understand the knowledge article components in smart assist

When you are interacting with a customer in an ongoing conversation, up to three top knowledge articles that match the conversation context are displayed in the **Smart assist** pane. The suggestions are dynamically refreshed based on the conversation context.

The following table lists the explanation of the smart assist card for AI-suggested knowledge articles.

| Label | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Displays the information about the cards when selected.|
| 2 | Title of the related knowledge article. When selected, opens the knowledge article in an application tab. |
| 3 | More commands|
| 4 | Displays the actions that can be performed when you select more commands.|
| 5 | A brief summary of the knowledge article that is generated by the AI model. |
| 6 | When selected, the link to the knowledge article is pasted in the conversation window that the agent can share with the customer. |
| 7 | Displays the confidence score based on which the knowledge article was selected by the AI model. Usually, the suggested knowledge articles are highly relevant to the context of conversations when the confidence score is above 80%; suggestions with lower confidence score may still be relevant based on the semantic meaning of some key words in the conversation. The minimum confidence score is 65%. |
| 8 | The feedback from agents is used by the AI model to retrain and improve the suggestions over time. When agent selects **Yes**, the label is highlighted and the card remains on the pane. If agent selects **No**, the card is replaced with a new suggestion, if it exists. |
| 9 |Displays information on the keywords that were used by the AI model to match the article.|

## Understand the similar cases components in smart assist

When you are interacting with a customer in an ongoing conversation, up to three top similar cases that match the conversation context are displayed in the **Smart assist** pane. The suggestions are dynamically refreshed based on the conversation context.

|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Displays the title of the similar case. When selected, opens the customer summary form in an application tab.|
| 2 | Summary of the case resolution that is generated by the AI model. |
| 3 | The confidence score based on which the similar case was selected by the AI model. Usually, the suggested similar cases are highly relevant to the context of conversations when the confidence score is above 80%; suggestions with lower confidence score may still be relevant based on the semantic meaning of some key words in the conversation. The minimum confidence score is 65%. |
| 4 |  Blue bar indicates that the user hasn't interacted with the card yet. |
| 5 | When selected, links to the current active case or removes the link to the similar case. |
| 6 | When selected, displays information on the keywords that were used by the AI model to match the article. |
| 7 | Status of the similar case. |
