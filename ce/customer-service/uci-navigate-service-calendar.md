# Navigate the service calendar

In the Service calendar, you can do the following tasks and activities: 

- View your organization's hourly schedule of appointments and service activities. 

- View work schedules and service activity schedules for a variety of resources. 

- Create new appointments and schedule service activities. 

- Change the status of an existing service activity. 

- Search for conflicts in the schedule. 

You can’t customize the service calendar or change the default view with the application. However, you can ask your system administrator to change the colors of the time blocks.

## View resources in the service calendar

1. Navigate to **Customer Service Hub** > **Scheduling** tab.

   ![Select Scheduling tab](media/uci-tools-scheduling.png "Navigate to the Scheduling tab")

2. Under the Tools section, select the service calendar.
    A list of resources is displayed in alphabetical order on the left side of the calendar.

3. To view the resources, appointments, and service activities for anyone in your organization, in the **Type** list, select **Resource**, and then in the **View** list, select the resource view. 

4. To find a specific resource, in the **Search** field, enter the first few letters of a name.

5. To change how much of the calendar is available to view, use the **Zoom** scale.
