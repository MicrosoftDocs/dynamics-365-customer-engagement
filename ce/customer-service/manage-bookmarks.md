# Manage bookmarks for reports

Save personalized views of your reports as bookmarks at user level. A bookmark captures the state of a report page, including changes that you've made to the filters. Use bookmark options to select a saved view, update or delete a bookmark, and set a default bookmark.

Bookmarks are available in historical analytics reports and knowledge analytics reports only.

## Create and manage bookmarks

1. In Customer Service workspace or Omnichannel for Customer Service, open one of the following reports:

    - **Customer Service historical analytics**
    - **Omnichannel historical analytics**
    - **Knowledge analytics**

1. On the report page, select a tab, such as **Summary**.

1. Adjust the report filters to customize your data view.

1. Select **Bookmarks**, and then select **Create new**.

1. Enter a name for the bookmark, and then save it.

1. Repeat the steps to create as many bookmarks as you require.
