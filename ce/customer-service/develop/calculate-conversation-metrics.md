# Calculate conversation metrics

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]

[!INCLUDE[cc-rebrand-bot-agent](../../includes/cc-rebrand-bot-agent.md)]

This article explains how to calculate conversation metrics in Dynamics 365 Customer Service. These metrics help you analyze key performance indicators (KPIs), make strategic decisions, track customer service representative (service representative or representative) and AI agent performance, and improve customer satisfaction.

This article also provides detailed guidance about calculating key conversation metrics. By using Power BI reports and Dataverse calculations, you can gain valuable insights into customer service efficiency. [Understand the conversation workflow](../use/overview-analytics-data-model.md#understand-the-conversation-workflow) to effectively utilize these metrics and improve customer service operations and decision-making. 

Learn more about [Session metrics](../use/session-metrics.md#session-metrics) and [Service representative metrics](../use/service-rep-metrics.md#service-representative-metrics).

## Total conversations

*Applies to Omnichannel real-time and Omnichannel historical dashboards.*

Total conversations include all interactions initiated by customers or representatives and engaged by agents, including ones that might be escalated to service representatives. It's a comprehensive metric that's used to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of agent interactions.

Learn more in [conversation states](../use/oc-conversation-state.md#understand-conversation-states).

## Abandoned conversations

*Applies to Omnichannel real-time dashboards.*

An abandoned conversation occurs when a customer escalates to a service representative, either directly or through a voice or chat agent, and the conversation closes before the representative accepts it.

Only inbound conversations count toward abandonment rates. Outbound conversations and those deflected by an agent or IVR/voice agent aren't included.

Customers may abandon a conversation because of long wait times, supervisor intervention, or overflow rules like voicemail or external transfers.

### DAX query and Dataverse reference

**DAX query**

```dax

## Abandoned conversations (excludes short abandons)

*Applies to Omnichannel real-time and Omnichannel historical dashboards.*

Inbound conversations that customers abandoned after the short-abandon threshold. These are meaningful abandons that affect service performance. Because short abandons from early hang-ups are excluded, the resulting abandonment and service-level KPIs more accurately reflect operational performance.

**DAX query**

```dax

Abandoned conversations (excl. short abandons) = [Abandoned conversations] - [Short abandoned]

## Incoming conversation (excludes short abandons)

*Applies to Omnichannel real-time and Omnichannel historical dashboards.*

Total inbound conversations minus those abandoned within the short-abandon threshold (based on first wait time). This metric excludes short abandons, giving you a more accurate denominator for KPIs like abandonment rate and service level. By filtering out early hang-ups, these rates better reflect actual operational performance.

**DAX query**

```dax

Incoming conversation (excl. short abandons) = [Incoming conversations] - [Short abandoned]

## Conversation first wait time

*Applies to Omnichannel real-time dashboard.*

Conversation first wait time is how long (in seconds) a customer waits for a service representative to accept the conversation after escalation from an AI agent or direct queue entry, or until disconnection, if the user abandons the conversation before the representative accepts the conversation.

### DAX query and Dataverse reference

The following DAX query and the corresponding Dataverse entities are used in the Power BI semantic model.

## Conversation handle time

*Applies to Omnichannel real-time dashboards.*

Conversation handle time is the time that service representatives spend actively helping customers and resolving their issues. The system aggregates the time that multiple service representatives spend when they handle a conversation transferred to them. This metric also includes time that service representatives spend wrapping up the conversation after the customer disconnects, and the time spent in updating notes or contact details. The time that subject matter experts or other service representatives spend consulting on the conversation isn't considered.

For chat and digital messaging, a service representative is actively working on a conversation if it's open in the Copilot Service workspace or Contact Service workspace app. When handling multiple conversations, only the time spent on the open tab is factored in the handle time calculation.

For the **Voice** report, this metric is the sum of total talk time, total hold time, and total active wrap-up time or after-call work, divided by the number of calls handled, where:

:::image type="content" source="../media/aht-voice.png" alt-text="Screenshot of average conversation handle time for voice in Dynamics 365 Customer Service.":::

For the **Chat** report, this metric is the sum of the active chat time and active wrap-up time, divided by the number of chats handled, where:

:::image type="content" source="../media/aht-chat.png" alt-text="Screenshot of average handle time for digital messaging and chat.":::

This metric can be viewed in two formats: seconds and hh:mm:ss.

## Average conversation hold time

*Applies to Omnichannel real-time and Omnichannel historical dashboards.*

The average hold time per conversation in seconds. If multiple service representatives handled the conversation, the hold time across all the service representatives is aggregated. This metric is calculated by dividing the total hold time for all conversations by the total number of handled conversations.

There are several reasons why a service representative might put a customer on hold. For example, the service representative might have to gather more information or research an issue, perform tasks that don't require interaction (for example, entering data into a system), or work on an offline task. A long hold time can cause customer frustration and might lead to a poor customer experience.

- **Conversation time**: Conversation time is the duration from when a customer starts a request until a service representative completes the conversation.

## Average conversation wrap-up time

*Applies to Omnichannel real-time and Omnichannel historical dashboards.*

Average conversation wrap-up time is a measure of the average time that a service representative spends completing any necessary tasks after the customer disconnects. These tasks might include documenting the conversation, updating notes, or updating the customer's information. This metric measures the time from the start of wrap-up to when the service representative closes the conversation. If multiple representatives handled the conversation, only the last representative's wrap-up time is counted.

This metric can be viewed in two formats: seconds and hh:mm:ss.

## Average active time

*Applies to Omnichannel historical dashboards.*

Active time shows how long an agent actively handles a chat across all session participants. Active time is calculated at each session participant level in a conversation. If a conversation has multiple session participants, each session participant has its own active time. The conversation handle time is the sum of all active time calculated across session participants of the chat conversation.

## Average conversation inactive time (min)

*Applies to Omnichannel historical dashboards.*

The metric refers to the average amount of time during a conversation when an agent isn't actively engaged with the customer. This metric is especially relevant in chat and digital messaging channels, where agents often handle multiple sessions concurrently.​ Inactive time is the duration when a conversation is open but the agent isn't focused on it—either because they’ve switched to another session or aren't interacting with the customer.
