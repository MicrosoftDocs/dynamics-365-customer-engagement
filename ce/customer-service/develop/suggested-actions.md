# Display suggested actions in a vertical layout

[!INCLUDE[pva-rebrand](../../includes/cc-pva-rebrand.md)]

Your bot can use suggested actions to present buttons or options in the chat window, which the user can tap to provide input. This way, users can answer a question or make a selection without having to use a keyboard.

To enhance the user experience and promote easy readability, use the data tags mentioned in [Customize a chat widget](customize-chat-widget.md) to display the suggested actions vertically.

The suggested actions feature is now supported in Microsoft Teams with other asynchronous chat channels.
