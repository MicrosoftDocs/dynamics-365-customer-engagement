# Live chat widget telemetry


The live chat widget in Chat for Dynamics 365 collects telemetry data from end users to improve the featureâ€™s capabilities, reliability, and performance over time by helping Microsoft understand usage patterns, plan new features, and troubleshoot and fix problem areas.

Some of the data collected by the live chat widget include the following. 

|Field|Sample value|
|----|----|
|OrganizationId |`11bb11bb-cc22-dd33-ee44-55ff55ff55ff` |
|Chat Widget Version |`prod` |
|BrowserName |`Edge` |
|OSName |`Windows`| 
|Anonymized IP Address (last octet redacted) |`19.207.000.000`| 

> [!IMPORTANT]

If your organization is concerned about the data collected by this service, you can turn off automatic data collection by adding an HTML attribute to the chat widget script.
