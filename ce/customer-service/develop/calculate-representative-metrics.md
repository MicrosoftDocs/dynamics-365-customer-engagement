This article provides details on how to calculate customer service representative metrics in Dynamics 365 Customer Service. Use these metrics to evaluate performance and efficiency, optimize operations, and enhance customer satisfaction. You can use these metrics to customize the visual display of your reports. Learn more in [Customize visual display](../use/customize-reports.md#customize-visual-display).


## Average first response time

*Applies to Omnichannel real-time and Omnichannel historical dashboards.*

Average first response time is the average time an agent takes to reply to a customer after the customer starts a conversation. 

The system calculates average first response time by dividing the total first response time for all engaged conversations by the number of engaged conversations. The time is adjusted for operating hours. You can view the time in seconds or in hh:mm:ss format.

### Related metrics

- **Average service representative response time**

Service representative response time is the average time that customers who send a message wait to get a response from a service representative. It's calculated by dividing total response time by the number of message exchanges in engaged conversations and is adjusted based on operating hours. Longer response times mean customers wait longer between messages, negatively impacting their experience.

The time can be viewed in seconds or hh:mm:ss format.

## Service level (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 120 secs)

*Applies to Omnichannel real-time and Omnichannel historical dashboards.*

Service level in 10 seconds is a performance metric for contact centers or customer service teams. It shows the percentage of customer interactions, like calls or chats, answered within 10 seconds.​ Service levels are measured in intervals of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 120 seconds. This metric is calculated as​: ​

Service Level (%) = (Number of interactions answered within 10 seconds / Total number of interactions) × 100​

For example, if 800 out of 1,000 calls are answered within 10 seconds, your service level is 80%.

## Conversations in service level (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 120 secs)

*Applies to Omnichannel real-time and Omnichannel historical dashboards.*

Conversations in service level (10 seconds) refers to the customer interactions (usually calls or chats) where the representative answered an incoming conversation ​within 10 seconds.

## Average consult time (min)​

The average time that service representatives spend helping other service representatives on consult requests. It's calculated by dividing the total time spent by service representatives on these requests by the total number of consult requests accepted. You can display the average consult time in minutes.
