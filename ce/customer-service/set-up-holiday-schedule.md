# Set up a holiday schedule (Customer Service)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Avoid having your service level agreements (SLAs) affected when your service organization is closed by creating a holiday schedule and adding it to your service calendar.  
  
 For example, if your service organization has an SLA to reply to email cases within two business days, you can create a holiday schedule and add it to your service calendar. Then, if a customer submits an email case on that holiday, your SLA is clear and is not affected by the holiday closure.

3.  Click **Holiday Schedule**.  
  
4.  Click **+** **New** and in the **Create Holiday Schedule** dialog box, enter a name and description for the holiday, and then click **Create**.  
  
5.  In the list of holidays, click the holiday you created.  
  
6.  When the holiday is open, click **New** to add the holiday to your customer service calendar.  
  
7.  In the **Add a Holiday** dialog box, specify the name and select the time of the holiday, and then click **OK**.  
  
 The holiday is created and associated with your customer service calendar. After the customer service schedule is associated to an SLA,  then your SLA during business hours is not affected.
