# View and understand the Agents report in Omnichannel real-time analytics

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

The **Agents** report consists of metrics that provide an overview of agent performance to help contact center managers optimize agent allocation in real time. This capability is crucial for ensuring that customers receive the best possible support.

The **Agents** report provides information about agent capacity and status for the last 24 hours. By drilling down to view details such as capacity at each agent level, managers can quickly identify and allocate resources to address any staffing shortages. In this way, they help ensure that customers receive support when they need it.

Supervisors can select the **All** filter to view agent performance across all channels. Alternatively, they can select a channel to view channel-specific agent performance. You can also filter areas by time, queue, time zone, and conversation status. For more information, go to [Overview of Omnichannel Real-time analytics dashboards](intro-realtime-analytics-dashboard.md).

## Interactive charts

You can view different types of charts on the report, such as donut charts. The visual display helps you discern changes and patterns in the data, so that you can act quickly to address the most important issues.

When you select a component in a chart, the data is filtered accordingly. In this way, you can view only data that is related to the selected component. For example, if you select the **Busy** component in the **Agent availability status** chart, the dashboard is refreshed and shows only the agents who are currently in the **Busy** state.

## Agent details drill-down

From the **Agent list** grid on the dashboard, you can drill down to key metrics about agent details. You can also drill down to view specific insights about the performance of individual agents. Select an agent name in the **Agent list** grid, and then select **Detailed view**.

Agent details are shown on a new page.

From the agent details page, you can drill down further through **Conversations**. In this way, you can track how a conversation progressed and the customer sentiment that is associated with it. Through **Agent presence history**, you can view agent presence in real time.
