# Create a customer service schedule and define the work hours (Customer Service)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

To define when your service or support team is available for providing support to customers, create a customer service schedule in [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)]. A customer service schedule determines the business hours for each day in a week and also the weekly off. [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] uses these details for time tracking of service level agreements (SLAs).  
  
 For SLA time tracking, make sure you add a holiday schedule to the customer service schedule, and associate this customer service schedule to the SLA record.
