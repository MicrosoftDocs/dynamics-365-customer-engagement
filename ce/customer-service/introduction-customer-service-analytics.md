# Customer Service Insights

Dynamics 365 Customer Service Insights helps both agents and customer service managers make better decisions and proactively improve customer satisfaction by using AI and analytics capabilities for Customer Service and Omnichannel. Now, Customer Service Insights is part of the embedded experience for Customer Service Hub and Customer Service workspace, bringing the power of AI and business intelligence directly into the core agent and manager experiences.

As a customer service manager, you can benefit from the AI topic clustering, actionable insights, and analytics surfaced by dashboards. As an agent, you can leverage real-time similar cases and knowledge article suggestions, customized for the current context. The AI-driven technology empowers agents to help solve the customer issues more quickly. improving resolution rates and customer satisfaction.

Built-in dashboards, interactive charts, and visual filters provide views into support operations data across channels. These dashboards highlight areas for improvement that can have the greatest impact to help you quickly evaluate and respond to key performance indicators (KPIs) and customer satisfaction levels.

As a supervisor, you can see view notable trends in metrics sorted by topics, channels, queues, and agents.
