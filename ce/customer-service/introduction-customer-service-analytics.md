# Customer Service Insights

Dynamics 365 Customer Service Insights helps both agents and customer service managers make better decisions and proactively improve customer satisfaction by using artificial intelligence (AI) and analytics capabilities for Customer Service and Omnichannel. You can empower your teams with insights into customer satisfaction–boosting analytics and AI-powered features to spend less time searching and more time engaging with customers. 

The premium AI capabilities in Customer Service Insights use advanced AI technology in natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG) to help your service team focus on what matters and guide them to success. As an agent, you can leverage real-time similar cases and knowledge article suggestions that are customized for the current context. The AI-driven technology empowers agents to help solve customer issues more quickly, improving resolution rates and customer satisfaction. 

These capabilities are deeply embedded into the core agent and manager experiences in Customer Service and Omnichannel.

### Important

If you are a customer who uses the Customer Service Insights standalone web application, your current working environment(s) will be terminated and inaccessible by December 8, 2021. You will no longer be able to use the standalone service after this date. The embedded Customer Service Insights features in the core applications will continue to be available and supported. For users who hold Customer Service Enterprise licenses, you will no longer be able to create new workspaces, but you'll retain access to existing ones. In the interim, the standalone app guide contains documentation for the web application.
