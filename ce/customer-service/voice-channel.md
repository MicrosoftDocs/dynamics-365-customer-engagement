# Introduction to the Voice channel 

Enable customer service representatives to communicate with customers on the phone to resolve issues with the voice channel in Dynamics 365 Customer Service. While many customers increasingly use chat, SMS text messages, and social media to engage and request support from organizations, phone calls continue to be an important communication channel. With the voice channel, Omnichannel provides agents with the ability to receive inbound and make outbound PSTN calls through a native calling experience in Dynamics 365, with real time AI-powered features such as live call transcription, sentiment analysis and AI-based Suggestions working out of the box to boost agent productivity. Omnichannel also provides a rich set of analytics and insights, including AI-driven topic clustering and call insights.

## Why choose the voice channel

### Native

The voice channel is built, owned, and operated completely by Microsoft. This means it is an all-in-one customer service solution without fragmentation or manual data integration required, and a faster time to value by enabling a quick and easy deployment of a voice channel for their business. In addition, the voice channel is built on Microsoft Azure Communication Services with the scale and reliability of the calling platform that powers Microsoft Teams worldwide today. Providing organizations with a choice of telephony delivered directly by Microsoft 


### Built alongside existing omnichannel capabilities

The voice channel is another channel to engage customers alongside existing other channels (Chat, SMS, social media) so it plugs into existing workflows and processes. This means the solution provides a single view of the customer that empowers agents to provide personalized service across all channels, and true omnichannel analytics and insights for agents and supervisors alike. 

that participates throughout the stack, i.e. Power Virtual Agent for IVR, Unified Routing for ACD, connected agent and supervisor experiences, connected reporting.

Customer service organizations will find that voice communication works well with 

Typically, customer service organizations must manually integrate standalone telephony and CRM solutions, which result in fragmented experiences for agents and customers across engagement channels. Ultimately, these stitched-together solutions from multiple providers are not only complex to roll out and maintain but create data silos with disconnected insights of customer interactions and agent performance across channels. The addition of the voice channel enables Customer Service to offer businesses a solution that minimizes failure points caused by custom-built, complex integrations, and maximizes the ability to create better customer and agent experiences. This single, holistic solution also makes it easier to scale to meet changing business needs.

Even with the rise of digital channels and self-service, telephony remains a critical channel for contact centers to provide customer support. Most CRM players lack native telephony and only support integrations with telephony providers, also known as CCaaS (Contact Center as a Service) players, through “at the glass” CTI (softphones) widgets. As telephony follows CRM to the cloud, customers are looking to simplify their combined solution. 
extending our current assets, such as Power Virtual Agent, Intelligent Routing and conversation canvas, we can offer a telephony solution directly within Dynamics OC.

Microsoft’s Omnichannel for Customer Service allows us to escalate web chat conversations to voice and video calls, this is a great feature when conversations become complex and a chat conversation is simply more long winded than a voice call.

ensuring consistent, personalized, and connected support across all channels of engagement
