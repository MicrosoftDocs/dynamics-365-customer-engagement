Enable your customer service representatives to communicate with customers on the phone to resolve issues using the voice channel in Dynamics 365 Customer Service. While many customers increasingly use chat, SMS messages, and social media to engage and request support from organizations, phone calls continue to be an important communication channel. With the voice channel, Omnichannel for Customer Service provides agents with the ability to receive and make public switched telephone network (PSTN) calls through a native calling experience in Dynamics 365, with real-time AI-powered features such as live call transcription, sentiment analysis, and AI-based suggestions to boost agent productivity. Omnichannel for Customer Service also provides a rich set of analytics and insights, including AI-driven topic clustering and call insights.

## Why choose the voice channel

Typically, customer service organizations must manually integrate standalone telephony and customer relationship management (CRM) solutions, which result in fragmented experiences for agents and customers across engagement channels. Ultimately, these stitched-together solutions from multiple providers are not only complex to roll out and maintain, but create data silos with disconnected insights of customer interactions and agent performance across channels.

### Native platform

The voice channel is built, owned, and operated completely by Microsoft. This means that it is an all-in-one customer service solution without fragmentation or manual data integration, and reduces time to value by enabling quick and easy deployment of the voice channel for your business. Also, the voice channel is built on Microsoft Azure Communication Services with the scalability and reliability of the calling platform that powers Microsoft Teams worldwide today.

### Built alongside existing omnichannel capabilities with a common data framework

The voice channel in Dynamics 365 Customer Service is another channel to engage customers with Chat, SMS, and social media, ensuring consistent, personalized, and connected support across all channels of engagement. As an example, agents can escalate web chat conversations to voice and video calls. As another example, routing a voice call to an agent is completed with unified routing, the same way an incoming chat message is assigned to an agent. By using the same platform, the voice channel works well with other features like an Azure bot. This means the process to create and deploy a conversational interactive voice response (IVR) bot is the same as the process to create and deploy a chat bot.

Beyond workflows and processes, the voice channel benefits from a common data framework with the other channels, allowing organizations to better understand each customer's journey whether the customer sent a chat, made a phone call, or used social channels. This means the solution provides a single view of the customer that empowers agents to provide personalized service across all channels, and true omnichannel analytics and insights for agents and supervisors alike.

### Differentiating AI

The voice channel has Microsoft's award-winning AI built into the product. This enables agents to resolve issues faster with tools like call transcriptions and sentiment analysis, and gain instant insights into trends.

### Support for emergency calling

The voice channel supports emergency calling where agents can dial in the emergency number in case of a crisis. Any omnichannel voice agent with a capacity profile associated with a voice outbound profile can make an emergency call. The emergency responders can call the agent back over a temporary callback number if the call is dropped (even if the agent had called via a shared outbound number).
