# Manage activities from the Timeline  
 Capture all interactions and communications you’ve had with your customer by adding them as activities in the Timeline section. The Timeline section gives you a unified view of everything that's happening on a case, like email received, a follow-up task that you created, system posts that are automatically generated when the cases is created, or any notes you take while talking to the customer.  

 When you update an activity, it moves up in the Timeline. You can sort the Timeline in both ascending or descending order of time, as per your wish.
