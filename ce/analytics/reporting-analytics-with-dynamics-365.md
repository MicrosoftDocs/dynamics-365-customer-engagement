# Introduction to reporting &amp; analytics with Dynamics 365
[!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] includes reports, dashboards, and support for [!INCLUDE[pn_power_bi_for_office_365_long](../includes/pn-power-bi-for-office-365-long.md)] that provides useful business information and visualizations to the user.  
  
 ## Paginated reports  
  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] includes a Report Wizard that can be used to easily create reports in just a few steps without using XML or [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL-based](../includes/pn-sql-based.md)] queries. For more information about the Report Wizard, see [Create, edit, or copy a report using the Report Wizard](../basics/create-edit-copy-report-report-wizard.md).  
  
 However, to create more complex reports, you can either create your own custom reports from scratch, or use an existing [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] report as a template. The topics in this guide show you how to create new reports or change existing reports using [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio](../includes/pn-visual-studio.md)] as the report writing tool and [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_Reporting](../includes/pn-sql-server-reporting.md)] as the report engine.  
  
 ## Dashboards  
  
 There are two types of dashboards in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]—user dashboards and system dashboards. Any user can create a dashboard visible only to them in their work area, such as Sales, Service, or Marketing.  An administrator or customizer creates or customizes system dashboards that, when published, are visible to everyone in the organization. A user can choose to set their user dashboard as their default dashboard and override the system dashboard.

 ## [!INCLUDE[pn_power_bi_for_office_365_short](../includes/pn-power-bi-for-office-365-short.md)]  
  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_power_bi_for_office_365_short](../includes/pn-power-bi-for-office-365-short.md)] is a self-service business intelligence (BI) platform used to discover, analyze, visualize data, and share or collaborate these insights with colleagues. [!INCLUDE[pn_power_bi_for_office_365_short](../includes/pn-power-bi-for-office-365-short.md)] provides information workers and everyday business users with excellent data analysis and visualization capabilities to get better business insights. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Use Power BI with Microsoft Dynamics 365](../admin/use-power-bi.md)  
  
 There are several ways you can use [!INCLUDE[pn_power_bi_for_office_365_short](../includes/pn-power-bi-for-office-365-short.md)] with [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]:  
  
-   Load a [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] content pack and start using the [!INCLUDE[pn_power_bi_for_office_365_short](../includes/pn-power-bi-for-office-365-short.md)] service to display Dynamics 365 insights.  
  
-   Customize a [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] content pack. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Customize Microsoft Dynamics 365 Power BI content packs](../analytics/customize-power-bi-content-packs.md)  
  
-   Use [!INCLUDE[pn_power_bi_desktop](../includes/pn-power-bi-desktop.md)] to modify and customize your reports and visualizations.  
  
-   Embed a [!INCLUDE[pn_power_bi_for_office_365_short](../includes/pn-power-bi-for-office-365-short.md)] tile in a Dynamics 365 personal dashboard.  
  
-   Use [!INCLUDE[pn_power_bi_for_office_365_short](../includes/pn-power-bi-for-office-365-short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Excel_Full](../includes/pn-ms-excel-full.md)] together.
