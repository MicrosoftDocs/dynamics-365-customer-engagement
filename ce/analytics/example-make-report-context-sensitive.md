# Example: Make a report context-sensitive

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

The following steps describe how to set up a context-sensitive report in [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)].  
  
 For example, if a report displays all activities for a particular account and you want to show this report on the [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] **Account** form, you must include **Activities** and **Accounts** in the **Related Record Types** categorization and specify **Forms for related record types** in the **Display** in field of the Report: New form.  
  
## Create and configure a context-sensitive report  
  
1. Create a report that contains fields from a Filtered\<entity> database view and establish one or more SQL JOINs with other related filtered views as required.  
  
2. If you have a Fetch-based report, you can use the following FetchXML query.  
  
   ```xml  
   <fetch>  
     <entity name="activitypointer" enableprefiltering="1" >  
       <attribute name="activitytypecode" />  
       <attribute name="regardingobjectid" />  
       <attribute name="subject" alias="subject" />  
       <link-entity name="account" from="accountid" to="regardingobjectid" link-type='inner' alias="accountLink">  
         <attribute name="name" alias="name" />  
       </link-entity>  
   </entity>  
   </fetch>  
   ```  
  
3. When you upload the report to [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] through the **Report: New** form, select all entities in the **Related Record Types** categorization that filtered views are referred to in the report's SQL code.  
  
4. In the **Display In** field, select **Forms for related record types** or **Lists for related record types**. Selecting Lists for related record types lets you run a report from the entity list grid. Selecting **Forms for related record types** lets you run a report from the entity form.
