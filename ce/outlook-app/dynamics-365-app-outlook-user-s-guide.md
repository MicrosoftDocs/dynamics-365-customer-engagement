# Dynamics 365 App for Outlook User Guide  

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The latest release of [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_dyn_crm_app_for_outlook](../includes/pn-ms-dyn-crm-app-for-outlook.md)], works with [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-9-0-0-online](../includes/pn-crm-9-0-0-online.md)] or later only. For a prior release that works with earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)], see [Deploy Dynamics 365 App for Outlook](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn946901.aspx).

Use [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_dyn_crm_app_for_outlook](../includes/pn-ms-dyn-crm-app-for-outlook.md)] to tap the power of [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] while you’re using [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] on the desktop, web, or phone. When [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_app_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-app-for-outlook-short.md)] is installed, depending on which version of  the app you have installed, you'll see a **[!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]** pane or window next to a selected [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] email message, or when you're composing an email message or setting up a meeting or appointment.  

 For example, when you open an email message, view information from [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] about the email recipients. Or with a single click, link an [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] email message or appointment to a specific [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] record. When you link an email message or appointment to a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] record, the [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] record appears as an activity for that record in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)].  

 <!--[Watch a short video (1:35) about Dynamics 365 App for Outlook.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=829982)  -->

## Known issues

For known issues with this version of [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_app_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-app-for-outlook-short.md)], see the [Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement Readme](../admin/readme-9.md).

## Prerequisites  
 Your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] system administrator can make [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_app_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-app-for-outlook-short.md)] available to your organization or you can add it yourself if:  

- You have the **Use [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_app_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-app-for-outlook-short.md)]** security privilege.  

- Your organization synchronizes mailboxes with server-side synchronization.  

  For more information, and for information on supported devices, browsers, and [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] versions, see [Deploy Dynamics 365 App for Outlook](deploy-dynamics-365-app-for-outlook.md).  

## Add the app to Outlook  
 After the prerequisites have been met, you can add the app directly from [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)].  

1. Click the **Settings** button ![Dynamics 365 web client Settings button](../outlook-app/media/mp-ua-r16-settings.png "Dynamics 365 web client Settings button"), and then click **Apps for [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]**.  

2. On the **Apps for [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]** page, under **[!INCLUDE[pn_crm_app_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-app-for-outlook-short.md)]**, click **[!INCLUDE[pn_crm_app_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-app-for-outlook-short.md)]**.

## Experience App for Outlook as a pinnable taskpane

If you're running Outlook 2016 for Windows (build 7668.2000 or later), App for Outlook will appear as a pinnable vertical [taskpane](https://docs.microsoft.com/outlook/add-ins/add-in-commands-for-outlook#launching-a-task-pane) to the right of an open message or appointment in Outlook. For more information, see [Implement a pinnable taskpane in Outlook](https://docs.microsoft.com/outlook/add-ins/pinnable-taskpane). 

## Add an email recipient as a contact or lead
One of the first things you might want to do when you receive a customer email, is add the person as a contact or lead to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. In the **[!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]** pane, click (+) and then select **Add as contact** or **Add as lead**.

![Add a contact or lead](media/add-email-contact-lead.png)

> [!NOTE]
> If the sender of the email is unknown to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], when you add the contact or lead, the email is automatically tracked in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] and set regarding this contact or lead. To stop tracking, you can manually untrack the regarding email. 

## Link an email message or meeting to a specific Dynamics 365 record  
You can link an email message or meeting to a specific [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] record, such as an account, opportunity, or case. This also tracks the email or meeting in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)].

1. Create or select an email or meeting.

2. Click the **[!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]** button in the email pane.

3. Click **Set Regarding** (---).

   ![Set Regarding](media/set-regarding-open.png)

4. Enter search text. A list of related records appears.

2. In Tracked regarding, click (...) > **Untrack**.

   ![Untrack Regarding](media/open-untrack-regarding.png)

## Track signed S/MIME emails
[!INCLUDE [pn-dyn-365-app-outlook](../includes/pn-dyn-365-app-outlook.md)] can track S/MIME signed emails in Outlook Desktop and Outlook Web App (OWA). This is enabled on Click-to-Run [!INCLUDE [pn-outlook-2016](../includes/pn-outlook-2016.md)] build 16.0.8730.1000 or later. To determine your Outlook version, go to **File** > **Office Account** > **About Outlook**.

## Customize the track regarding card

The admin can change what's displayed in the card that appears when you track the regarding email. For example, you might want to replace **Mobile Phone** with **Company Name** in the Contact card.

![Initial contact card](media/initial-contact-card.png "Initial contact card")

To change the fields that appear, follow these steps:

1. In [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], go to **Settings** > **Customizations** > **Customize the System**.
2. Expand **Entities** and choose an entity such as **Contact**.
3. Expand the entity and select **Forms**, then select the **App for Outlook Contact Card** form.

   ![Contact entity form](media/contact-entity-form.png)

4. Drag **Company Name** above **Business Phone**.

   ![Drag field in form](media/drag-fields-in-form.png "Drag field in form")

   ![After dragging field](media/after-dragging-fields.png "After dragging field")

   > [!NOTE]
   > The first three fields appear in the track regarding card.

5. Select **Save**, **Publish**, and then close the form editor.
6. On the solution page, **Publish All Customizations**. 
7. Close the solutions page.

After completing the above, right-click in the track regarding card, and then choose **Reload**. It will take a few minutes for the synchronization to complete and the change to appear.

![After customizing card](media/after-customizing-card.png "After customizing card")</br>
The company name now appears after the contact name in the Contact card.

## Compose an email message and link it to a Dynamics 365 record  
Create an email message and then follow the steps in [Link an email message or meeting to a specific Dynamics 365 record](#link-an-email-message-or-meeting-to-a-specific-dynamics-365-record).

## Gain insights into your activities with relationship assistant

The relationship assistant is designed to deliver the most important and relevant information in relation to what you are doing right now. The assistant works by analyzing all of the data at its disposal and generating a collection of action cards, each of which includes a message summarizing what the card is about, plus a set of links for taking action. The assistant sorts the cards by priority and filters them for your current context.

Some of what the assistant can do for you:

- reminds you of upcoming activities
- evaluates your communications and suggests when it might be time to reach out to a contact that’s been inactive for a while
- identifies email messages that may be waiting for a reply from you
- alerts you when an opportunity is nearing its close date

When you start your day by signing in to Dynamics 365, the assistant draws your attention to your most important items and tasks, drawn from all areas of the application.

To access the assistant, on the nav bar, click ![Menu - Insights](media/navbar-insights-btn.png).

<!--
## Monitor an email message after you send it  

 You can monitor an email message after you send it to see the number of times that the message is viewed, opened, replied to, or forwarded. For a monitored email message, you can also see the last activity related to the email message, or view all activity related to the message.  

 ### Monitor an email message  

1.  Create an email message as you normally would in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)].  

2.  Track the email message or link it to a record in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. You can’t monitor an email message unless you track it or link it (set a regarding record).  

3.  In the **[!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]** pane, click **Follow**, and then click **Follow this email**.  

 ![Follow email in Dynamics 365 for Outlook](../outlook-app/media/follow-email-dynamics-365-outlook.png "Follow email in Dynamics 365 for Outlook")  

    > [!NOTE]
    >  Any recipients that can’t be followed will be displayed at the bottom of the **[!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]** pane.  

4.  Send the message in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)].  

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >  Do not edit the email message or change the recipients after you follow it. If you edit an email message after it’s followed, you may inadvertently delete the monitoring information or you may inadvertently add recipients who shouldn’t be followed.  


### Remove the monitoring for an email message  

1.  Select the monitored email message.  

2.  Click **Unfollow**.  -->

## Add an email template when you create an email message  
If you frequently send the same type of email, you can save time by using an email template. When you use an email template, [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_app_outlook](../includes/pn-dyn-365-app-outlook.md)] automatically inserts the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] information such as contacts or set regarding information in the email message.  

For example, you could use a Thank you template to save time whenever you want to send a thank you message to a customer.  

![Email template in Dynamics 365 App for Outlook](../outlook-app/media/email-template-dynamics-365-app-outlook.png "Email template in Dynamics 365 App for Outlook")

2. At the top of the **[!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]** pane, click **Document** > **Add Template**.  

   ![Add an email template](media/add-template.png)  

3. Select the record type (entity). The default is the set regarding record. Then, click **Select**. 

   ![Select the entity](media/select-entity-email-template.png)  

4. Start a search for the template you want. Under **Search Template**, click (---).

   ![Select search](media/select-template.png)

For information on creating email templates in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], see [Create templates for email](../admin/create-templates-email.md).  

## Add sales literature or a knowledge base article when you create an email message  

 When you're working with a customer, you might want to send them some sales literature or a knowledge base article.  
> [!NOTE]
> You must have the appropriate permissions to add sales literature or knowledge base articles to an email message.

1. Create an email message as you normally would in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)].

## Track Outlook contacts in Dynamics 365  
 You can track [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] contacts in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] by using the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] add-in, an [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] solution module.   The add-in is automatically installed when you install [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_app_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-app-for-outlook-short.md)]. You can access it as described below.  

> [!NOTE]
>  [Delegated users](https://support.office.com/article/Allow-someone-else-to-manage-your-mail-and-calendar-9684B670-7588-4EEA-8717-9E5799047540) can not use [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_app_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-app-for-outlook-short.md)] to track emails.

 Using the add-in, you can:  

- View a list of [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Office](../includes/pn-ms-office.md)] contacts or [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] contacts, and see which contacts are tracked  

- Link contacts to accounts in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]  

- Open the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] contact or account record with a single click  

  When the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] add-in is installed, you’ll see a new **[!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]** tab on the [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] ribbon.

## Synchronization and tracking 

The Dynamics 365 App for Outlook tracks and synchronizes your mail and calendar data between Outlook (Exchange) and Dynamics 365. Server Side Synchronization is an asynchronous service that runs in the background approximately every 15 minutes to synchronize items between Exchange and Dynamics 365. In most scenarios, the Outlook item is immediately created in Dynamics 365. However, in some cases, Server Side Synchronization service is used to promote the item to Dynamics 365 and keep it synchronized, which may take up to 15 minutes. The below table provides a brief explainer of the behavior.

![Outlook app sync](media/sync_table.png "Outlook app sync")

   > [!NOTE]
   > Server Side Synchronization is used to promote emails when Microsoft Outlook includes images in email signatures as attachments.

If the Dynamics 365 App for Outlook uses Server Side Synchronization to track an item to Dynamics 365, the track status of the item will be “Pending”.
