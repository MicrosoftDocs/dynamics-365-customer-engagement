# Dynamics 365 App for Outlook User's Guide, version 8.2 

[!INCLUDE [cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

Use [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_dyn_crm_app_for_outlook](../../includes/pn-ms-dyn-crm-app-for-outlook.md)] to tap the power of [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] while you’re using [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] on the desktop, web, or phone. When  [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_app_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-app-for-outlook-short.md)] is installed, depending on which version of  the app you have installed, you'll see a    **[!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]** pane or window next to a selected [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] email message, or when you're composing an email message or setting up a meeting or appointment.  
  
 For example, when you open an email message, view information from [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] about the email recipients. Or with a single click, link an [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] email message or appointment to a specific [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] record. When you link an email message or appointment to a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] record, the [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] record appears as an activity for that record in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)].

-   View information about [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] contacts and leads while you’re working in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)]. You can view this info in the context of an email message, meeting, or appointment. For example, view phone numbers, company name, last and next activities, and recent records from [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)].  
  
-   Link email messages, meetings, and appointments to a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] record with a single click. For example, link an email message to a specific account, opportunity, or case.   [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_app_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-app-for-outlook-short.md)] also supports custom entities.  
  
-   Open [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] records directly to find or enter more detailed information.  
  
-   Add a phone call, task, or appointment activity to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)].  
  
-   Create a new [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] record for any entity (record type), as long as the entity has been enabled for mobile and for multi-entity search.  
  
-   Add email templates, knowledge articles, and sales literature when you create an email message or set up a meeting.  
  
-   Track [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] contacts in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)].  
  
> [!TIP]
>  [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_app_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-app-for-outlook-short.md)] is a [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Office](../../includes/pn-ms-office.md)] add-in. As of the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_8_2_0_both](../../includes/pn-crm-8-2-0-both.md)], [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_app_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-app-for-outlook-short.md)] paired with [!INCLUDE[cc_server_side_synch](../../includes/cc-server-side-synch.md)] is the preferred way to use [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] together with [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. You may also be familiar with [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)], which provides complete [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] capabilities (including offline capabilities) from [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)]. **Note that tracking activities is not supported when [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_app_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-app-for-outlook-short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] are used together by the same user. Choose one or the other.** For more information about [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)], see [Dynamics 365 for Outlook User's Guide](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt843833.aspx).
  
<a name="Prerequisites"></a>   

### Prerequisites  
 Your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] system administrator can make [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_app_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-app-for-outlook-short.md)] available to your organization or you can add it yourself if:  
  
-   You have the  **Use [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_app_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-app-for-outlook-short.md)]** security privilege.  
  
-   Your organization synchronizes mailboxes with server-side synchronization.

<a name="Access"></a>   

### Use the app for the first time  
 To display [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] data after you’ve added the app:  
  
1.  Select an existing email message in your Inbox, or create a new email message or appointment.  
  
2.  On the ribbon, click the **[!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]** button.  
  
     ![Dynamics 365 App for Outlook ribbon](../media/dynamics-365-app-outlook-ribbon.png "Dynamics 365 App for Outlook ribbon")  
  
     The **[!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]** pane appears on the right side of the screen and shows information about the recipients.  
  
     ![Dynamics 365 App for Outlook pane](../media/dynamics-365-app-outlook-pane.png "Dynamics 365 App for Outlook pane")  
  
     **Notes:**  
  
    -   If the recipient is a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] user (as opposed to a contact or lead), it’s indicated next to their name:  
  
         ![Dynamics 365 user in Dynamics 365 App for Outlook](../media/dynamics-365-user-dynamics-365-app-outlook.png "Dynamics 365 user in Dynamics 365 App for Outlook")  
  
    -   If the recipient isn’t known to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], you can click **Add to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]** to add them as a contact or lead.  
  
<a name="Track"></a>   

### Link an email message or meeting to a specific Dynamics 365 record  
 You can link an email message or meeting to a specific [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] record, such as an account, opportunity, or case, by clicking the **Set Regarding** button  ![Set regarding button in Dynamics 365 App for Outlook](../media/set-regarding-button-dynamics-365-app-outlook.PNG "Set regarding button in Dynamics 365 App for Outlook"). [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] automatically tracks the email or meeting, and links it to the record indicated in the **[!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]** pane.  
  
 ![Set regarding button in Dynamics 365 App for Outlook pane](../media/set-regarding-button-dynamics-365-app-outlook-pane.png "Set regarding button in Dynamics 365 App for Outlook pane")

        > [!TIP]
        >  This is the same list of pinned and mostly recently used records you see in the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] apps or Dynamics CRM web client.  
  
    -   If you don’t see the record you’re looking for, enter a keyword in the search box, and then click the magnifying glass.  
  
#### To create a new record and link it to a Dynamics 365 record:  
  
1.  Click **New**, and then select the type of record you want to create.  
  
     ![Add new record in Dynamics 365 App for Outlook pane](../media/add-new-record-dynamics-365-app-outlook-pane.png "Add new record in Dynamics 365 App for Outlook pane")  
  
2.  Fill in the information in the form.  
  
     ![Create new record in Dynamics 365 App for Outlook Quick Create form](../media/create-new-record-dynamics-365-app-outlook-quick.png "Create new record in Dynamics 365 App for Outlook Quick Create form")  
  
3.  If you want, click the **Open record after saving** check box.  
  
4.  Click **Save**.

<a name="TrackSigned"></a>    
 
### Track signed S/MIME emails
Dynamics 365 App for Outlook can track [S/MIME signed emails](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/aa995740(v=exchg.65).aspx) in Outlook Desktop and Outlook Web App (OWA). This is enabled on [Click-to-Run](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj219427.aspx) Outlook 2016 build 16.0.8730.1000 or later. To determine your Outlook version, go to **File** > **Office Account** > **About Outlook**.

<a name="CustomizeCard"></a>    

### Customize the track regarding card
The admin can change what's displayed in the card that appears when you track the regarding email. For example, you might want to replace **Job Title** with **Business Phone** in the Contact card.

![Before customizing Contact card](../media/initial-contact-cardv8.png "Before customizing Contact card")

To change the fields that appear, follow these steps:

1. In Microsoft Dynamics 365, go to **Settings** > **Customizations** > **Customize the System**.
2. Expand **Entities** and choose an entity such as **Contact**.
3. Expand the entity and select **Forms**, then select the **Contact** form.

   ![Select Contact main form](../media/contact-entity-formv8.png "Select Contact main form")

4. Drag **Business Phone** below **Account Name**. Drag **Job Title** below **Mobile Phone**.

   ![Drag Contact form fields](../media/drag-fields-in-formv8.png "Drag Contact form fields")

   ![After dragging Contact form fields](../media/after-dragging-fieldsv8.png "After dragging Contact form fields")

   > [!NOTE]
   > The first four fields appear in the track regarding card.

5. Choose **Save**, **Publish**, and then close the form editor.

6. On the solution page, choose **Components** > **Prepare Client Customizations**.   

   ![Select Prepare Client Customizations](../media/prepare-client-customizationsv8.png "Select Prepare Client Customizations")

7. Close the solutions page.

After completing the above, right-click in the track regarding card, and then select **Reload**. It might take some time for the synchronization to complete and the change to appear.

![Contact card after customizing](../media/after-customizing-cardv8.png "Contact card after customizing")<br/>
The business phone number replaces job title in the Contact card.

<a name="AddEmailRecipient"></a>   

### Add an email recipient as a contact or lead
One of the first things you might want to do when you receive a customer email, is add the person as a contact or lead to Dynamics 365. In the Dynamics 365 pane, click (+) and then select **Contact** or **Lead**.

> [!NOTE]
> If the sender of the email is unknown to Dynamics 365, when you add the contact or lead, the email is automatically tracked in Dynamics 365 and set regarding this contact or lead. To stop tracking, you can manually untrack the regarding email.

<a name="ComposeEmail"></a>   

### Compose an email message and link it to a Dynamics 365 record  
  
1.  Create an email message as you normally would in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)].  
  
2.  Click the **[!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]** button on the ribbon.  
  
3.  Do one of the following:  
  
    -   Click a **Set Regarding** button  ![Set regarding button in Dynamics 365 App for Outlook](../media/set-regarding-button-dynamics-365-app-outlook.PNG "Set regarding button in Dynamics 365 App for Outlook") for a particular record in the **[!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]** pane.  
  
    -   To find a different record, click **Track this email** at the top of the **[!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]** pane as described earlier in this topic.  
  
    -   To create a new record and link it at the same time, click **New**.  
  
4.  If you select a different email message in your Inbox or add people to the **To**, **Cc**, or **Bcc** line, the list of recipients will be automatically refreshed in a few seconds.  
  
<a name="EE"></a>   

### Monitor an email message after you send it  
 You can monitor an email message after you send it to see the number of times that the message is viewed, opened, replied to, or forwarded. For a monitored email message, you can also see the last activity related to the email message, or view all activity related to the message.  
  
#### To monitor an email message  
  
1.  Create an email message as you normally would in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)].  
  
2.  Track the email message or link it to a record in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. You can’t monitor an email message unless you track it or link it (set a regarding record).  
  
3.  In the **[!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]** pane, click **Follow**, and then click **Follow this email**.  
  
     ![Follow email in Dynamics 365 for Outlook](../media/follow-email-dynamics-365-outlook.png "Follow email in Dynamics 365 for Outlook")  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Any recipients that can’t be followed will be displayed at the bottom of the **[!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]** pane.  
  
4.  Send the message in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)].  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >  Do not edit the email message or change the recipients after you follow it. If you edit an email message after it’s followed, you may inadvertently delete the monitoring information or you may inadvertently add recipients who shouldn’t be followed.  
  
#### To remove the monitoring for an email message  
  
1.  Select the monitored email message.  
  
2.  Click **Unfollow**.  
  
<a name="Template"></a>   
### Add an email template when you create an email message  
 If you frequently send the same type of email, you can save time by using an email template. When you use an email template, [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_app_outlook](../../includes/pn-dyn-365-app-outlook.md)] automatically inserts the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] information such as contacts or set regarding information in the email message.  
  
 For example, you could use a Thank you template to save time whenever you want to send a thank you message to a customer.  
  
 ![Email template in Dynamics 365 App for Outlook](../media/email-template-dynamics-365-app-outlook.png "Email template in Dynamics 365 App for Outlook")  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You must have the appropriate permissions to add email templates.  
  
#### To add an email template:  
  
1.  Create an email message as you normally would in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)].  
  
2.  At the top of the **[!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]** pane, click **Templates**.  
  
     ![Add an email template in Dynamics 365 App for Outlook](../media/add-an-email-template-dynamics-365-app-outlook.png "Add an email template in Dynamics 365 App for Outlook")  
  
3.  In the **Template Regarding** list, select an option  
  
4.  Select the template you want, and then click **Add to Email**.  
  
     ![Select an email template in Dynamics 365 App for Outlook](../media/select-an-email-templatte-dynamics-365-app-outlook.png "Select an email template in Dynamics 365 App for Outlook")  
  
     For information on creating email templates in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], see [Create templates for email](../../admin/create-templates-email.md).  
  
<a name="KB"></a>   

### Add sales literature or a knowledge base article when you create an email message  
 When you're working with a customer, you may want to send them some sales literature or a knowledge base article.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You must have the appropriate permissions to add sales literature or knowledge base articles to an email message.  
  
1.  Start by creating an email message as you normally would in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)].  
  
2.  At the top of the **[!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]** pane, click **Sales Lit** or **Articles**.
