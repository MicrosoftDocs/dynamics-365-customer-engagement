# Expand the columns which the Set Regarding lookup searches on

To have the Set Regarding lookup search on custom columns in Dynamics 365 App for Outlook, that column must be added to the table’s quick find view.

2. On the left nav, select **Solution**.
3. Select the solution that contains the table and then select **Edit** on the command bar. For more information on solutions, see [Solutions overview](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/solutions-overview).
