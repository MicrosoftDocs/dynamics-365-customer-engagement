## Add an email recipient as a contact, lead, or account

When an Email or Appointment is created or received with a recipient who's email address does not resolve to a record in Dynamics, you might want to add this from the App for Outlook. You have the choice to add the unresolved email address as a Contact, Lead or Account.


In the **Dynamics 365** pane, click (+) and then select **Add as contact** or **Add as lead**.

> [!NOTE]
> If the sender of the email is unknown to Dynamics 365, when you add the contact or lead, the email is automatically tracked in Dynamics 365 and set regarding this contact or lead. To stop tracking, you can manually untrack the regarding email.
