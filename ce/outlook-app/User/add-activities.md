# Add an activity to a tracked row 

Use Dynamics 365 App for Outlook to track a row and add activities such as a phone call, appointment, or task to the row.

1. Open the Dynamics 365 pane, and select an item in your email which you're tracking using App for Outlook.

2. Select **More commands** ![Select more commands button](../media/more-command-button-appforoutlook.png) and then select **Add Activity**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   >![Select more commands](../media/add-activity-appforoutlook.png)

2. Select an activity.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Select an activity](../media/select-activity-to-add-appforoulook.png)

3. Fill in the information. The **Subject** and **Description** fields is auto populated using the information from the tracked record but you can edit this information.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Add a task activity](../media/add-task-activity-appforoutlook.png)

4. When you're done, select **Save and Close**. Or, select the down arrow and select **Save & Create New**.

The activity is created in your customer engagement apps (such as Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation), and is linked to the record the activity was added to.
