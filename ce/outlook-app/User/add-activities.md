   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Open App for Outlook pane](../media/open-pane-appforoutlook.png)  
   
2. Select an item in your email that you're tracking using App for Outlook.

3. Select **More commands** ![Select more commands button](../media/more-command-button-appforoutlook.png) and then select **Add Activity**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   >![Select more commands](../media/add-activity-appforoutlook.png)

4. Select an activity.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Select an activity](../media/select-activity-to-add-appforoulook.png)

5. Fill in the information. The **Subject** and **Description** fields is auto populated using the information from the tracked record but you can edit this information.
