# Deploy Dynamics 365 App for Outlook  

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - The latest release of [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_dyn_crm_app_for_outlook](../includes/pn-ms-dyn-crm-app-for-outlook.md)] works with customer engagement apps in Dynamics 365 (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation), [Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises), version 9](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/overview), and [Microsoft Dataverse](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro).
> - App for Outlook uses Microsoft Edge browser when you are using Windows 10 (version 1903 or later) OS and Outlook Click-2-Run client that’s updated to the current channel, Monthly Enterprise channel, or Semi-annual Enterprise channel (16.0.13127.20508 or later). For other combination of Windows and Outlook, App for Outlook uses Microsoft Internet Explorer browser.
> - Multi-factor authentication with [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_app_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-app-for-outlook-short.md)] and Server Side Synchronization is supported only in an online-only configuration. It is not a supported scenario for Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) or Microsoft Exchange on-premises.
>
> - [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_app_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-app-for-outlook-short.md)] is not supported on [Microsoft 365 shared mailbox](https://support.office.com/article/open-and-use-a-shared-mailbox-in-outlook-d94a8e9e-21f1-4240-808b-de9c9c088afd).
>
> - [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_app_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-app-for-outlook-short.md)] is not supported in configurations that have Dynamics 365 apps and Microsoft 365 (Exchange Online) in different tenants.
> 
> - Windows 7 had reached [end of life](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-7-end-of-life-support-information) and is no longer a supported client OS for Dynamics 365 App for Outlook.

People can use [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_dyn_crm_app_for_outlook](../includes/pn-ms-dyn-crm-app-for-outlook.md)] to tap the power of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] while using [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] on the desktop, web, or tablet. For example, view information about email or appointment recipients, or link an [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] email or appointment  to a [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] record such as an opportunity, account, or case. To learn more about what [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_dyn_crm_app_for_outlook](../includes/pn-ms-dyn-crm-app-for-outlook.md)] offers, see the [Dynamics 365 App for Outlook User Guide](../outlook-app/dynamics-365-app-outlook-user-s-guide.md).  

## FAQs

There are two ways to install [!INCLUDE [pn-ms-office](../includes/pn-ms-office.md)]: using a Windows Installer (MSI) version or a Click-to-Run (C2R) version of [!INCLUDE [pn-office-shortest](../includes/pn-office-shortest.md)]. You might have issues accessing [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] in the Add-ins area of [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] if you don't have the necessary updates for your installation version. For more information, see [Issue when trying to access Dynamics 365 apps within the Add-ins area of Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/help/3211586/error-message-0x8006ffff-occurs-when-you-access-dynamics-365-within-th).

The Outlook App is not enabled on [Microsoft Dataverse](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro).

> [!NOTE]
> Support for 2013 versions of Office 365 ProPlus ended on February 28, 2017. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [See here.](https://support.microsoft.com/help/3199744/support-for-the-2013-versions-of-office-365-proplus-ends-february-28-2)    

- Customer engagement apps in Dynamics 365 (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation), [Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises), version 9](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/overview), and [Microsoft Dataverse](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro).


- Synchronization of incoming email through server-side synchronization. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Set up server-side synchronization of email, appointments, contacts, and tasks](../admin/set-up-server-side-synchronization-of-email-appointments-contacts-and-tasks.md)  

- [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_app_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-app-for-outlook-short.md)] is an [!INCLUDE [pn-outlook](../includes/pn-outlook.md)] add-in that uses [!INCLUDE [pn-exchange-web-services-ews](../includes/pn-exchange-web-services-ews.md)] to interact with [!INCLUDE [pn-microsoft-exchange](../includes/pn-microsoft-exchange.md)]. This requires OAuth be enabled on [!INCLUDE [pn-microsoft-exchange](../includes/pn-microsoft-exchange.md)]. For more information regarding this dependency, see [Authentication and permission considerations for the makeEwsRequestAsync method](https://docs.microsoft.com/outlook/add-ins/web-services#authentication-and-permission-considerations-for-the-makeewsrequestasync-method).

- On Windows clients, Internet Explorer 11 should be installed and enabled but not necessarily the default browser. For more information about this dependency, see [Requirements for running Office Add-ins](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/concepts/requirements-for-running-office-add-ins#client-requirements-windows-desktop-and-tablet).

- Required security role access as described below

> [!NOTE]
>  Supported configurations and requirements for [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] features are listed throughout our documentation. Specific configurations not documented should be  considered unsupported.  

### Provide security role access
Dynamics 365 App for Outlook is an App Module in version 9. The minimum set of privileges required to run App for Outlook are packaged as a security role called **Dynamics 365 App for Outlook User** which is bound to the App. You need to add users to this role in order for them to access Dynamics 365 App for Outlook. In order to achieve this, follow the steps below:

1.  From the main menu navigate to **Settings** > **Security** > **Users**.

2.  Select the users from the list and then click **Manage Roles**.

3.  In the dialog that appears, apply the **Dynamics 365 App for Outlook User** security role to the users.

This will ensure that the users have the basic privileges needed to access App for Outlook. Other security privileges on top of the basic privileges, related to the user's role, will light up more features. For example, if a user has create privilege on Lead entity, in addition to **Dynamics 365 App for Outlook User** security role, they would see an email resolve to a Lead entity where applicable.

> [!NOTE]
>  The security role **Dynamics 365 App for Outlook User** is available from Build 9.1.0.4206. If a user doesn’t have this security role or its underlying privileges, they’ll receive the following error: 
> “You haven't been authorized to use this app. Check with your system administrator to update your settings.”

### Supported configurations with Microsoft Exchange  
 As of the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_8_2_0_both](../includes/pn-crm-8-2-0-both.md)] you can use the app with any combination of [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_op_edition](../includes/pn-crm-onprem.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange_Online](../includes/pn-exchange-online.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange_Server_short](../includes/pn-exchange-server-short.md)] (on-premises), including hybrid configurations. This means you can use [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_app_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-app-for-outlook-short.md)] in any of the following configurations:

   -   To push the app to certain users, select those users in the list, and then click **Add App to Outlook**.  

   > [!TIP]
   >  If the list shows that a user is pending or hasn’t been added, you can click the **Learn more** link next to the user to find more information about status.  

4. When you’re done, click **Save**.  

5. Make sure to add users to the security role **Dynamics 365 App for Outlook User** as described in the **Provide security role access** section above.

## Troubleshooting installation problems  


1. If you don't see [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_app_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-app-for-outlook-short.md)] when you click the **Settings** button ![Settings button](../admin/media/mp-ua-r16-settings.png "Settings button"), check that you've enabled the feature.

2. If you or your users have trouble installing [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_app_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-app-for-outlook-short.md)], it may be because their [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] mailbox is currently linked to another Microsoft Dataverse environment or Customer Engagement (on-premises) organization. An [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] mailbox (email address) can only synchronize appointments, contacts, and tasks with one organization, and a user that belongs to that organization can only synchronize appointments, contacts, and tasks with one [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] mailbox.  You can overwrite the setting stored in [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] if you want to change the primary synchronizing organization.
