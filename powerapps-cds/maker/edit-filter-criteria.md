# Edit filter criteria and change sort order in views

[!INCLUDE [cc-applies-to-powerapps-and-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc-applies-to-powerapps-and-update-9-0-0.md)]

<a name="BKMK_EditFilterCriteria"></a>   

Along with the columns displayed in a view, the filter criteria applied to a view is a critical part of the value provided by the view.  
  
1.  When you create or edit the view, select **Edit Filter Criteria**.  
  
2.  The dialog shows a user interface similar to **Advanced Find**. You can use **AND** and **OR** clauses to specify and group criteria.  
  
3.  Select **OK** to close the **Edit Filter Criteria** dialog box.
