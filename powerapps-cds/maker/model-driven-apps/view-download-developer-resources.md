 **Developer Center** 

 The [Dynamics 365 Developer Center](http://www.crmdevelopercenter.com) on MSDN contains a wealth of information to help developers. Here you will find the SDK, which includes documentation, samples, and tools, as well as technical articles, ramp-up kits, videos, blogs, forums, and more.
